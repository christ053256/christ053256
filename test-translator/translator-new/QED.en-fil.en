That meal was a religious experience.
Well, they say... the way to a man's heart is...
Well after a dinner like that, you're going to get a little more than my heart.
We are so having sex tonight.
I think I'm going to cry.
This is so awesome.
I mean, it's so romantic and It's so wonderful.
And I can't wait to tear your clothes off and get you back to bed.
But there's one thing I have to get out of the way.
Are you a killer?
What?
What are you talking about?
Are you the one who poisoned J-Cub's drink at our party?
No, Nelson, no!
I told you that before.
Why don't you trust me?
I do trust you!
I didn't even want to ask the question.
I just wanted to go to bed, but I had to, because my stupid roommates don't trust you.
They're crazy!
I trust you, you know what, and you're innocent.
Thank you.
I know you didn't poison your roommate.
He was your friend.
I can't even believe I asked you this crap.
Case closed!
We're moving on!
Oh, that's nice.
I like that.
Oh, wow!
I like where you're going with that.
You know where I'm going.
That's nice.
Okay, hello, yeah.
I do have one more question before we start.
What comes to mind when I say the name Ramone Santiago.
Uh... owner of the Eagle.
I guess the word boss comes to mind since I work for him.
So, not cold blooded murderer?
They made me ask you that.
Now, what are you trying to get at?
Well, Romano and J-Cub had a huge fight the night before J-Cub was poisoned.
So, I don't know.
Do you think maybe they were...
Doing it?
Yeah.
Ramone sleeps with all his employees.
All of them?
Yeah, pretty much.
Though, J-Cub was different.
A little bit.
Ramone was like obsessed with him or something.
He would call at weird times of the day and night and texted him a lot.
Like a dozen times a day, or more sometimes.
Well I texted you 20 times yesterday.
22 actually. But, I wasn't counting.
That's different though.
I like to hear from you.
Uh... J-Cub was scared of Ramone though.
And it's no secret that Ramone has a violent temper.
This one-time J-Cub showed me this text from Ramone.
That said he would never let him leave.
And if he ever tried to leave, he would hunt him down.
Did you tell this to the Police?
Uh, no.
I haven't actually called them back yet.
I just haven't gotten around to it.
But, I will.
Wow, you know, nobody really saw Ramone at the party.
So I guess he, I don't know, he couldn't have been the person who put the poison and J-Cub's drink.
Unless he had someone else do it for him.
What am I doing?
This is nuts!
Hey, you know what, fuck the bedroom.
Roommates are gone.
I say we do it here.
Nelson, hang on.
This talking about J-Cub kind of gets in my head.
And uh, kills the mood a little bit.
Is it okay if we take a rain check tonight?
Absolutely.
You know, I'm sorry.
I can't even believe it brought up these stupid questions.
I'm dumb.
It's okay.
You know what, don't worry about it.
We're going to get to the bottom of this.
Well good. Cause that was kind of where I was going to go here, anyway.
After, I work on your nips for a little while, until you want to scream.
Then hold you in my arms all night.
Cause I'm a such a cuddle monster like that.
I'm sorry, did I just say that all out loud?
Yeah, you did.
Ah, well. I'm not sorry.
That was an empty apology.
Well, uh...I'm going to go.
And thank you for dinner. Thank you.
I'm just going to get out of here for now.
I'll talk to you later.
I'll text you. Probably... 20 times.
You know, crazy me.
Well, I'll be counting.
I can't believe I just got cock-blocked by a dead guy!

Episode 11
She talks in her sleep now . I'm never going to get sleep.
What the heck am I going to do ?
That's right
I spent the whole night with Seung Jo.
You mean that when I wake up, Seung Jo will be in the same bed as me.
Seung Jo.
It's time to wake up.
Did you sleep well?
Good morning.
It was a disaster sleeping with you last night.
Why?
Because of your terrible sleeping habits.
What are you talking about?
I'm a totally still sleeper.
Stop kidding me.
Wear this one.
I don't want to.
Are you just going to stare at me like that?
Ah, sorry...
You act like it's your own home.
Really?
Is that so? en espa√±ol it feels different when I'm staying in Seung Jo's apartment. It feels like we're living together.
What kind of fantasy are you having now?
Don't overdo it.
He's never been late for work.
What's the matter? " Oh Han Ni and Baek Seung Jo spent the night together" Did they really spend the night together?
You know that girl from the tennis club.
Oh her?
Hey! Baek Seung Jo!
Since when did you...?
Lucky you
Tell us, tell us the details. So how was it?
I said to give us some details.
Mother!
What's your problem?
Why are you calling me "Mother"?
You're embar . . .
Mother!
How can you tell so quickly?
The way you disguise yourself so that one can tell in one look... please do something about it!
And what do you think you're doing coming all the way to my school and causing all this?
Ha Ni, how are you feeling, after being sick and all?
I'm alright now.
Really?
That's a relief.
Alright...So how was it?
Huh?
How was it...?
Your voice is very loud.
It was nothing special.
Ah...really?
Seung Jo is that type of man?
That's unbelievable.
Oh yes! Ha Ni, did you give him the chocolates?
Right! The chocolates!
The chocolates..
I lost the chocolates!
What do you mean you "lost" them?
It is a sign of love.
Where did it go?
What to do?
Baek Seung Jo's chocolates!
Do you see me volumizing the ends?!
Isn't it off the hook!
I'm really good at it!
I'll make sure your hair isn't damaged and-- Welcome!
Bong Joon Gu...
What?
Slept together?
Baek Seung Jo and Oh Ha Ni?
My feet just dragged me here...
When I spoke to Ha Ni not long ago she didn't tell me anything like that.
There is no way Ha Ni won't tell me the big news.
Weren't you mistaken and went around in the rain for nothing?
From a kiss to sleeping together...that's great!
Now everything is over.
It's over.
Ah... Joon Gu... Joon...
Bong Joon G...
Can I tell her? Jung Ju Ri You're early today.
There is no way.
Seung Jo...
Do you want to get dinner together after class? I think I'm going to die because of this upcoming test.
Min Ah, you don't study for exams? There's no way I can study for all 12 subjects.
If there's no way for Dok Go Min Ah, then it's absolutely impossible for Oh Ha Ni. Fine, I've made a decision. I'm only going to study for English.
Only English? Why? It's the only subject I'm taking with Seung Jo, so if I fail that as well, then it's all over.
No matter what I get on the other subjects, I'm definitely going to pass English.
Oh Ha Ni, you are now in study mode.
Ah! I don't have much time. I'm leaving.
Oh, aren't you the one who works at the restaurant?
Oh right!
What are you doing here?
Are you waiting for someone?
Looks like you're not in a good mood.
It's not that I'm in a bad mood. I am trying to give up my love My heart feels like it's breaking apart.
What do you mean give up on love?
You shouldn't give up on love. No, certainly not.
I've only been following for the past few years. I never even went on a date with her.
This is a very serious matter.
Have you tried confessing your feelings?
Confessing?
Oh, so you don't know how to confess.
Look
This is how you do it.
You grab the girl like this.
You pull her like this, push her up against a wall, and when she looks up, then you say,
" If you can forget me then go ahead," and suddenly kiss her.
If you do it like this the girl won't even be able to think
When they're flustered, they'll suddenly have feelings for you!
That's how you confess.
That's right!
A confession.
I won't die from it, so let's try it.
Hyung-nim, thank you! Oh right!
Timing is very important thing, timing! Brought to you by the PKer team @ www.Viki
Ha Ni, you're here!
Your face doesn't look good.
Even when it's exam week, you two look fine. Usually, you're supposed to take tests with your every day capabilities.
If you try to study it all at once, then how could they test what you've learned?
Then the test would just be some kind of photographic memory test or something.
Isn't that right Seung Jo?
How did you do on the other tests? So so.
I will really do my best on the test, so that we can attend the same class next semester together...
This English test is famous for being hard.
What are you going to do?
Weren't you hitting it pretty close in the last test too?
Ha Ni, it would be better if you attend this same class for another year.
You know that girl you saw before,
Ji Yeon, who Seung Jo and I were tutoring.
She's going to be attending our school.
How about you attend the same class next year?
Ha Ni, why are you glaring at me like that?
Your eyes will burst. This is the first time I'm taking a test together with Seung Jo.
Why are you not finishing?
I'm done.
There is still 40 minutes left!
Already?
Seung Jo, wait for a second.
Let's go out together.
It was surprisingly easy, right?
Oh, you didn't even write anything!
What are you going to do?
I came because
I have something to tell you.
Oh, really?
What is it?
Even if you don't tell me anything,
I know everything.
You probably don't know how much my heart ached that night.
But no matter how much I thought about it, it didn't seem right.
To be honest,
I can't bring myself to give up on you Ha Ni. But still, once a guy pulls out his sword, he's got to see it till the very end.
I'm just going to be understanding about everything that's happened.
Ha Ni, I thought about giving you up, but it won't go the way I want.
You don't have to be sorry.
How is it your fault?
It's that fool Baek Seung Jo that's trying to seduce you!
Quite soon
I'm going to beat the crap out of that Baek Seung Jo.
So, forget everything and let's start over,
Ha Ni.
Ha Ni?
Ha Ni, are you sleeping?!
Hey!
Hey, Bong Joon Gu.
Hurry.
What?
Hey, Bong Joon Gu.
What are you trying to start over?
That night, nothing happened between them.
He didn't touch a hair on her.
Really?
Yeah, really.
Man, that Baek Seung Jo is a real gentleman!
Wow, you're even complimenting Baek Seung Jo.
Ha Ni!
Let's go!
Oh Ha Ni.
Let's start dating.
Hey, Gi Tae, when did you arrive?
You've come back?
Hey, go and practice.
What are you saying so early in the morning?
Ha Ni's got someone.
It's not a joke.
I am Kyung Su's friend, and starting next semester I'll be attending the same school
I'm Kim Gi Tae.
Nice to meet you.
Since you guys are here already, say hello.
He is your Tennis club Sunbae,
His name is Kim Gi Tae.
Greet him.
- Hello.
- Hello
If you're done, go and practice Go, go.
You're a funny guy.
Since when do you know Ha Ni, that you want to go out with her as soon as you met her?
Haven't you heard?
Oh Ha Ni and Baek Seung Jo.
I know.
Ha Ni likes Baek Seung Jo, right?
Ever since high school, I've watched over those two.
Huh?
Then, why?
Especially since the two of you aren't dating, that means that I too, have a chance.
Yes? Suddenly...
Was it too fast?
OK, good.
This week-end,
let's go on a date.
You need to get to know me as well.
That's how it's going to be.
Then, see you later. I'm leaving. Before leaving, let's have a game.
She totally froze up.
Hey Ha Ni. Isn't he really good looking?
When we first joined this school, Gi Tae and I were very popular with the female Sunbaes,
Him for his looks, and me for my charisma.
But that Gi Tae, to you . . .
You punks!
You won't go practice?! It feels weird. I was very surprised.
Is it real?
Did it really happen?
Did he ask you out?
Isn't this the first time in your life?
You've always been the one doing the chasing!
I heard he was a sunbae?
Who might he be?
I'm curious!
How is he?
Is he tall?
What about his looks?!
Is he good looking?
Well, a little.
You're embarrassed!
He must be good looking.
Hey, Baek Seung Jo knows too?
Right right.
Does Baek Seung Jo know too?
I'm saying, Ha Ni got confessed to by a really cool guy.
Really?
So?
So if you don't do something, Ha Ni and that guy might get together...
You're not worried?
You sure do get excited over nothing.
That's what you wanted to say?
I'm not worried.
Oh? really?
He wants to date you?!
Yes.
But it's not a big deal.
Omo!
Who would like you? How can he be just like his brother!?
The thing I've been fearing has finally come.
Someone as cute as Ha Ni...
I knew I would lose her like this soon enough.
This is all because Seung Jo is dragging his feet.
Stop it dear.
Don't get so worked up.
Stuff like this is all the free will of the person.
What kind of guy is he?
It's a sunbae and he's one year older than me.
We're in the same grade.
Sunbae?!?
My god the most dangerous person is a male Sunbae!
I don't really remember his face.
Ha Ni, haven't you been tricked by a player?
You're all naive and go around smiling at any old guy right?!
No, dad. I'm not like that.
I have to do whatever I can.
I can't leave it like this. It's gotten much bigger than I expected.
Today has been eventful. Still, he confessed to me knowing I like Seung Jo He's a bold person.
Hey you.
I'll see you later.
Oh Ha Ni.
Why did you come...?
You can't forget my face.
So I came to show you my face.
Hey, Baek Seung Jo is working part time at a restaurant?
Huh?
Yes.
Last time I went, you were there too.
I heard that you went there everyday.
I went a few times
You know, I'm pretty damn smart too.
Of course I wasn't as visible due to the all around perfect Baek Seung Jo.
Then are you approaching me because of Seung Jo...
Of course I was provoked a bit by Baek Seung who's good at everything whether it's studying or tennis.
As I was worrying about Baek Seung Jo, it's true that I saw you following him around everywhere.
Suddenly without me even realizing it, little by little,
I started looking at you.
Ah, yes.
You would still step forward despite being rejected by Baek Seung Jo over and over again.
You could say I was touched by that, Oh Ha Ni.
Anyway I was pulled towards you. Hey, just go out with me.
Don't waste your precious youth on Baek Seung Jo, when you don't even know if he will turn around towards you.
Have an amusing campus life with me.
What do you think?
Even so, I...
I was wondering who it was.
It's Gi Tae Sunbae!
Oh, Yoon Hae Ra.
Do you know each other?
I met him often during the tennis matches.
But do you know each other?
I am going out with Oh Ha Ni.
Ah, that's not true.
So, you're going to give up Seung Jo now?
Of course!
Don't just say whatever you want!
Before Kyung Su Sunbae, and now Gi tae Sunbae.
You're so popular Oh Ha Ni!
You suit each other well.
See you later at the club room.
Ok.
See you later.
Sunbae, continue what you were doing.
Make sure to keep it moving straight forward!
I'll be going first.
See you later.
Oh, I can't believe it!
His face is about a... 85%
He seems to have a bright personality and he's enthusiastic.
If he's a law major...
A future politician or lawyer?
Mother.
Oh!
This...
Did you possibly go to school to see that sunbae?
He's Seung Jo's rival, so we need to analyze him real well and plan something.
The way I see it, this guy is much cuter than Seung Jo.
What to do?
If this guy takes your heart,
What would I do?!
Mother.
Not to worry.
I will always think of Seung Jo only.
Ha Ni.
I'll go reject him right now!
I'm deeply touched!
Oh wait!
No, don't go.
Ha Ni you shouldn't reject him.
Yes?
Let's try to make Seung Jo jealous.
Eh! That's impossible.
No, no.
He may be acting so cocky all the time, but just wait and see. Seung Jo will definitely feel himself being pulled towards you!
Because you're always next to him, he is relaxed and doing other things!
But if you suddenly show him another side of you, he will notice his feelings for you.
Will it be alright to use such a dangerous plan like this? Will it be okay?
Will Seung Jo really be jealous?
You don't have to be thinking like that.
Do well.
Gi Tae sunbae is smart, and is very popular with the ladies.
But seeing that he has an interest in you, he does have really unique taste then.
That's a relief.
Then again, one man's trash is another man's treasure.
What are you talking about?
Though I'm like this, aside from you, I'm quite popular with the guys.
Maybe he's got a bad eye or a real weirdo.
That person is just as smart as you are and as good looking as you.
Most of all, compared to you, he is really nice to girls.
I'm in a good mood, because Ha Ni thinks of me like that.
Well Baek Seung Jo, seeing how it is, why don't you pass Ha Ni on to me?
So it was you Sunbae.
Do as you please. What did he say? I can't believe him.
Gi Tae Sunbae
Oh yes princess?
Where are we going on this Sunday's date?
I'm okay with anything.
Whether it's the mountain or the sea, I'll go anywhere.
Sunbae, Congratulations.
I'm serious!
Seung Jo! If it goes on like this, I'm really going to cheat on him! I won't regret it!
What would you like to order?
One ice tea.
Do you want to kill time with that again?
Today, I didn't came here to see you.
I'm here for an other appointment.
Ha Ni, I'm sorry.
On the way here, there was a traffic jam.
Did you wait long?
No, I just arrived here, too.
Oh, hi Baek Seung Jo.
One coffee for me, with ice.
Yes. Ice tea and iced coffee.
Wait for a moment please.
Today, it's finally the much anticipated Date day.
The weather today was really nice!
What would you like to do?
Well, I don't really know.
Perhaps, is this your first date?
Huh?
No way.
I've gone on dates before.
With Baek Seung Jo?
Yes.
Then again, it's our time to have all the fun in the world.
From now on, I'll take you out a lot.
Yes.
Where should we go?
There's this new rollercoaster, which is really fast. Should we go to the amusement park?
It sounds fun!
What should we do afterwards?
Watch a movie at the drive-in theater and eat something delicious.
Oh I totally like it, the drive-in theater.
I've never been there before.
Excuse me.
Then how about we go to a nice park and ride bikes?
Oh I like that!
Oh let's do that first, then let's go to the amusement park, and the drive-in theater.
Enjoy.
Have you gone to the Namsan Tower?
There's a place there, where you can write your names on a lock and if you do your love will stay true!
Watch your head.
Here, sit.
Oh, let's take another one. Brought to you by the PKer team @ www.Viki If he's this nice to me...
Ha Ni!
Did you have a nice time?
Yes.
Here.
It's been a long time since I had this much fun.
Why is that?
Is it because when you're with Baek Seung Jo, you're nervous?
Well.
How many years have it been that you liked Baek Seung Jo?
What?
More or less 4 years.
Since High school.
I guess this will be a prolonged war for me, then.
What?
No...
If you loved him for 4 years...
Just because I've suddenly appeared before you, doesn't mean your heart is suddenly going to change.
Even if you only think of me from time to time,
I'm satisfied with that. He's 180 degrees different from Seung Jo. I expected it, but Seung Jo eventually didn't show up.
Ha Ni, let's go! I can't let it continue like this. This just allowed me to reconfirm that Seung Jo really has no feelings for me.
What are you doing?
Ah, Sunbae.
What are you thinking about in a place like this?
Were you looking at something?
No.
You were looking at Seung Jo from here?
Sunbae, I . . .
Oh Ha Ni!
Forget Seung Jo already.
Sunbae, I have something to sa-
Come here.
Ha Ni.
S-sunbae.
- No...
- What is this?
Sunbae!
I think I've seen you before.
What are you trying to do to Ha Ni?
Joon Gu don't!
I was wondering what fool kept hanging around my Ha Ni.
You little fearless...
If you compare the time hanging around, then you've done it much longer.
What are you saying?
What do you know?
Yes, Bong Joon Gu.
Why don't you give up already?
What?!
Stop it already!
What's going on?
What do you think you're doing in the library?
You two aren't fighting over Oh Ha Ni, right?
Hey Baek Seung Jo, this has nothing to do with you.
So, back off.
Despite you guys fighting or shedding blood...
It doesn't really matter, but still.
The only person Ha Ni likes is me.
So isn't it a waste to fight over it?
Seung Jo.
My mother said for us all to eat dinner together.
Let's go.
Slow down.
Baek Seung Jo, you have quite a lot of confidence.
What?
The only person Ha Ni likes is me?
My heart could have changed.
You haven't thought about that?
Never.
But, you were a little jealous, right?
If you're going to put on a show...
Why don't you use your brains a bit more.
I can see right through everything you and mother are doing. Dummies.
He already knew everything...
He really can't be tricked.
See how nice it is for us to all gather like this?
You like it too, right Seung Jo?
Living alone I know exactly what you eat.
No matter where you go, eating at home is the best.
That's right. No matter which restaurant I go to, nothing compares to a home cooked meal.
I thought you said Dduk Bok Gi was the best thing in the world?!
Stupid.
But hey Su Chang, you aren't eating much today.
A new game is coming out so he's been pulling a lot of all nighters, so he's really tired.
Ahjusshi, I'll get some more soup for you.
No, his doctor told him not to eat too much.
No matter how enjoyable your work is, make sure you take of your health first.
Good health is the best thing!
Of course.
Gi Dong shi, you take care of your health too.
Of course!
Healthy is as healthy can be!
They ate up 3 bowls of Bool Nak porridge!
There's no way.
Seriously!
I'll just be leaving then.
I thought you would sleep here tonight and then go...
Seung Jo, I have something to tell you.
See me for a bit.
Yes.
You are now an adult, too.
What do you think about your future plans?
It's been some time since you left the house.
I feel like it's about time you start clearing up your thoughts.
No, not yet.
Seung Jo.
I wish you would manage my gaming company.
First, as my right hand man.
Next, as a successor of the company.
What do you think?
It's not that you're asking me what I think, but that I should do as you say, isn't it?
So you're just deciding my future as you wish.
No, that's not it.
If you're done talking, I'll get up first.
Okay, go.
I'm going.
Okay.
Go safely.
Just as the holidays were approaching... Seung Jo suddenly disappeared.
He didn't show up at the tennis courts and even stopped part-timing at the family restaurant.
Where could Seung Jo have gone?
Okay, I'm taking it.
One, two, three... Say cheese!
The trails around here are really nice.
We'll be preparing the bbq while you're gone.
Thank you.
Good-bye.
Hyung!
I've come.
Sticky gum Ha Ni has found Seung Jo's new part time job!
Eun Jo, you came by yourself?
What about mom and dad?
Dad couldn't come because of work and mom said she couldn't leave dad alone.
Mother was really very disappointed.
It's obvious.
The water is really good!
The water is really famous, seriously!
Aigoo, Ha Ni!
Ha Ni has come!
Well then, if you need anything else, just call me.
Rest for now.
Yes.
Why did you come so late?
Ah, this must be Eun Jo.
Just as I thought, it was you Sunbae.
Why don't you just open up your own broadcasting company.
What are you talking about?
You didn't tell other people too, did you?
Seung Jo!
Have you been well?
Oh Eun Jo is here too!
Oh Seung Jo, have you been doing well?
Our villa is right over there.
I want to invite you over for dinner.
Want to come?
You're coming, right?
Eun Jo, hello.
Kyung Soo sunbae!
Just to me?!
What kind of secret information is this?!
I have something to tell you, come this way.
Ha Ni, Ha Ni.
I'm thinking about closing the deal with Hae Ra this time.
Do you think, you can do that?
So, I really need your help.
You and I have to join forces to stay afloat.
First off, I need you to keep staying near Seung Jo and stop him from approaching Hae Ra.
Sunbae it's Hae Ra that is approaching Seung Jo!
Has Seung Jo ever approached Hae Ra?
Just becoming a couple is important.
I'm going to ask to play a couple game.
And then you can just become a couple.
- You and Seung Jo.
Me and Hae Ra. - Ay...
Is it that easy?
I've tried it this whole time and it's still yet to happen.
Don't worry.
I've planned and prepared everything.
Give me your hand.
Let's try our best in order to achieve our loves!
I feel uneasy for some reason.
What are you doing?
I said, let's do fighting!
Fighting.
Hello all my youthful visitors.
You've all come here in order to create memories of your youth.
Will checking out the scenery here and there create memories?!
No it won't.
So the couple games start now!
Fool.
The way to play this game... Take a look at the map and see the numbers 1-7?
Those are all places.
The couple that gets a stamp from all those spots first, wins the game.
This is the stamp!
It's not just a treasure hunt...
But a stamp hunt!
Then we have to decide on your partner.
Your partner will be decided fairly...
We'll use this ladder game method.
Why isn't Seung Jo here?
And really it couldn't be helped...
But I will be joining this game in order to keep all of you safe. It really couldn't be helped.
What the?
Eun Jo, haven't you seen Seung Jo?
I don't know.
Where the heck did he go?
Here you go, this is it.
Hae Ra, what number?
Ah!
Number 3!
Then I'll be 8.
Everyone pick. Brought to you by the PKer team @ www.Viki
I'm dying here.
It's like some villas or something.
Let's see.
Is this here?
I can't tell.
I'm sure it'll show up eventually.
Ha Ni, just wait!
I'll definitely protect you!
From now on, I'll never send you off alone!
Let's go.
Why must I do this with Oh Ha Ni?!
Oh! It's there, it's there!
Come quickly!
Wow it seems we're the first ones!
Right, right, right?!
Shut up.
Ya, let's do this on good terms.
Why are you being like this too?
Either way I can't even be with Seung Jo after coming this far.
Even elementary kids don't play games like this!
Do your legs hurt?
I'll piggy back you.
Try getting on my back.
Oh really!
Did you set this up?
You picked 3 first.
How could I cheat that?
It's a bug.
I want to quit!
It's not fun.
Who said we're doing this for fun?
The great Yoon Hae Ra can't lose to Oh Ha Ni, right?
Seung Jo wouldn't like that either.
We just need 6 more.
Let's hurry up and find it then.
Where can it be?
You're the one that hid the stamps, Sunbae. So how could you not know, Sunbae?!
Since the trees all look the same, it's a little confusing.
What is it?
Since we just got the 4th stamp we just need to go...
Did you hear that?
Just now, that sound...
Wasn't that the sound of a wolf?
Idiot.
Wolves went extinct in our country.
Then...a bear!?
I think I heard Ha Ni's voice.
Thank god! It's probably not following us, right?
It is not a relief!
Where are we?
It's alright Eun Jo.
Noona will try to figure out our path.
Don't worry.
Are you alright?
Yes, I am alright Eun Joo.
Stupid!
But...my hat disappeared.
It's my most cherished.
Stay there. I'll come down there.
Yes.
Eun Joo, be careful!
Where are we supposed to go?
How did this change? Last night there wasn't any water.
Strange.
Hey, Hae Ra, let's go together.
Oh, hey, Hae Ra!
Let's go together! Together!
I found it!
The stamp, the stamp!
Where?
Oh, that?!
The stamp!
Let's go, hurry!
Gosh!
This is why there's no reason to like you.
It's alright, I'm going.
Hey Hae Ra...
Seeing a guy like this, doesn't your motherly instincts...
Isn't that Ha Ni's hat?
Did something happen to you, Ha Nl?
Just wait there awhile. I'll come and rescue you.
Oh that!
Alright this.
Aigoo!
Aigoo!
Got it.
Got it.
Alright, alright!
Oh, Seung Jo!
Oh, really!
Seung Jo.
Seung Joo, give me water..
What happened to Sunbae?
I don't know!
His body build is completely useless!
Seung Jo, the mountains here are pretty rough.
There are animals making noises in the mountains.
Anyways, it was really hard.
Where are Eun Joo and Ha Ni?
They were the first ones to leave.
They're still not back?
Give me water, water...
It got cold.
I am hungry too.
But other than that, the problem is not finding our way back.
There's still no signal.
Cell phones must not even work here.
Here.
Baek Eun Joo! You are amazing.
That's it!
Preparation.
If you are prepared you'll be happy.
Analogy...
What is it?
Just put this over yourself.
Our Eun Jo sure is reliable.
It feels like being with mini Seung Jo.
First we need to find the canyon.
If we follow the path we came from, then we're going to be able to find a way out.
If we wait, won't Seung Jo come?
You are really stupid!
How will he know that we are here?
Are you cold?
You can hold it.
You're so reliable.
The sun is going to go down, and my feet are killing me. Damn it!
Anyway, I need to go.
Aigoo!
Ha Ni, I am really sorry.
I can't go up in this condition.
Like this..
Like this, definitely
This can't be!
Aigoo!
No!
No!
No! That can't happen!
Ha Ni!
I love you!
That sound, there it is again!
What do we do!
It's probably a village dog or something!
Isn't that Ha Ni's voice?
Ha Ni!
Ha Ni!
It must be coming this way.
What should we do?
Get behind me.
Hyung!
Eun Jo!
Hyung!
Seung Jo!
Won't anyone help me?
I would be grateful if someone came to help me.
Oh.
Hey. Grab this.
Isn't that voice Baek Seung Joo?
Hurry and grab this.
Hey.
Why are you butting in?!
Who the hell are you to save me!
Screw off!
Really?
Then, I'm leaving first.
Hey, hey!
Where are you going now?
Fine, we have to save Ha Ni.
Calm down, she's safe. She went to the camp first.
Rea...Really?
It is a relief, you really did well.
It is really a relief!
Hey! Then... would you help me?
Man I'm dying.
Shut your mouth.
I can't show anyone this side of me.
Especially not to Ha Ni.
Got it?
Anyways, nobody knows that you're here.
Don't worry.
Man, I'm a complete mess.
How can I show this side of me to Baek Seung Jo.
Baek Seung Jo!
I'm going to return the favor.
That's not very appreciative.
Oh...Seung Jo!
Did you come out for a walk?
Yes. You should've come alone.
Huh?
Saying that you like me and stuff.. don't you know how I feel?
How you feel...
There's no way someone like me...
It was a dream.
I was surprised.
No wonder
It was playing out so smoothly.
If I knew it was a dream...
I should have dreamed a bit longer before waking up.
But... the feeling of his lips
For the first time I want to do something.
I'm going to apply for medical school. I have a dream too.
Tell me that dream.
That you want to do something with me?
I'll make it come true.
Did you grab your wallet?
A new wife, I'm sure you want to call him honey.
Let me choose what I want to do with my life.
Baek Seung Jo
I've decided to become a doctor.
I will not inherit father's company.
Father!
Father, what's wrong!
Honey! Are you okay?
This is the first time you want to do something right?
If I do this, Dad will be happy.
[Interviewer:] You often use the word 'emptiness', but also many times, you speak about God.
Can you say, they are one? [Mooji:]
Even to say, 'they', would make emptiness into another.
Let's say that whatever concept we may hold, whatever sensation or feeling or thought, arises in that Oneness, in what I would call, or refer to as emptiness, whatever perception, whatever ideas, must arise in that space of emptiness, including our idea about God, you see.
For me, it's natural to speak of God because for so long
God was my great Other, for a while.
Now, when I speak of God, it's a feeling, a deep feeling within.
Is it that I'm speaking to Father?
I don't think about it.
If it's speaking to my Self, it's a natural instinct within that refers or relate to what I call a supreme power.
Sometimes, I'm in that mood where I feel, Yes, you know.
I will say, Father, thank you for this ability to perceive and to experience which I am enjoying right now.
Sometimes, I will say this.
Another time, this mood is not there.
And I'm not speaking about God, not because... Sometimes, this mood is simply not there. And, there's no sense of other.
Even God, as I said before,
I don't have the sense it's other, you see. Now, if you feel that God is in you, and even God is you,
God is me, the reaction that may come is that you feel a great power, and that you can do so much.
You can change the world or miracles can come, or... [M:]
Actually, the opposite is true for me.
I don't know about others. But when I discovered the God-Self, God-Power in me,
I realized, I couldn't do so many things. [Mooji chuckles]
I didn't want to do so many things.
I had a false idea of my own power to do, to change, to fix.
When I met God, so to speak, I didn't feel like I had to do anything.
Didn't feel it as a great achiever.
I don't feel, even, as a non-achiever.
I was just happy; happy and settled, at peace.
I was not even thinking about God, thinking about God.
I felt like... Like, when you are with your mother, are you thinking about your mother?
I didn't.
I felt like, when I'm with God, I'm not thinking about God.
I don't feel ...
People say, 'But you're in duality.' I'm not even thinking about duality.
So, I don't know what is my state.
Hey guys Shurelya here from Shurelily.com bringing you
League of Legends Basic Class Lesson 2 - "Introduction to Wards".
Map control is a very important aspect of League of Legends, and wards are one of the most basic ways of achieving it.
Having vision of where your opponents are will help you to make more informed decisions during the game.
Wards are a purchasable item, that you can buy from the consumables tab of the shop.
To place a ward simply click the item in your inventory, then click on the target location.
If you are you range to use the ward, the ward will be placed and will turn invisible after a few seconds.
Basic Wards come in two flavours. Sight wards, which are green, cost less and give you basic vision.
Vision wards, which are purple, cost a little bit more and have slightly less sight range.
However, Vision wards will allow you to see invisible units, including enemy wards.
Wards can be destroyed after three hits, but you must be able to see a ward in order to hit it.
Ward vision also follows the same rules as your own character, and cannot see into brush or around corners.
However, a ward can grant vision of a brush if it is inside of it.
Wards are your most basic defense against being killed by enemies from different lanes, from the jungle.
Where you should place a ward is dependent on the types of enemies you're dealing with.
If your enemy is a slow moving one with no closer such as a pre-level 6 Warwick or Shyvanna, you're probably going to want to place priority on warding at your flank since they have no gap closer.
If you're dealing with a pressure heavy enemy such as Maokai or Xin Zhao, you're going to want to ward both your flank and side.
You have to think about the value you are getting out of your wards when you do decide to use one, since they do have resource cost.
Warding here for example will protect your lane flank.
Warding this position protects you from side ganks and gives you vision of the Dragon as well as gives you a slight amount of vision on this path here.
It is much better than warding slightly below it which doesn't give you the bonus of the slight vision on this path.
Enemies with a high amount of mobility, or that manage to sneak through can also gank through the lane here.
Warding these side brushes can also protect you from harassment from enemy teams sniping through the brush as well as protecting you from this kind of gank.
For this next warding position, I can cover these two different attack paths with one ward, however it still leaves one open.
In the end its all about where you want the coverage. Full coverage is going to cost you three wards which is very expensive.
These are just some of the basic things you can do with wards, you can also use them to inform you of the enemy attacking Baron Nashor, or of general enemy position in the jungle.
In conclusion, I'll leave you with a very important lesson.
The support is not the only person that should be buying wards!
The financial burden should go to the whole team, otherwise the support won't have the money to buy any supportive items for you.
This concludes today's lesson and good luck out there on the fields of justice.
Class dismissed.
There's something going on with you, isn't there?
You're not sleeping?
Don't even think about lying to me.
There's nothing going on.
I want to live here with dad, you and san. what...?
Why?
And what about Young Master JunPyo,school and everything?
Didn't I say it before? I have nothing to do with Goo JunPyo
Also, after putting up with so much humiliation, you still regret it? Oh, gee!
So in this small rural town, selling fish, crabs and webfoot octopus, smelling like fish, that's how you want to live?
What's wrong with that?
Oh my gosh...
We're done for !
We're finished !
What hope do we have to live for now ?
Mom..
Forget it!
Yi Jung sunbae....
There's still no news from JanDi?
No.
I don't know what she's thinking.
She hasn't called.
She just said she went to a fishing village but never said where it is.
She must be doing ok.
It's Geum Jandi we're talking about.
You seem to know my friends better than I do.
Like I said before,
I have some knowledge when it comes to girls
How is JunPyo sunbae doing?
He's a mess.
GaEul...
Don't you think it's time we start talking about us?
GaEul
I...
I'll go first.
You don't have to feel burdened because of me.
I already know how you feel.
So, from now on, I won't look for you anymore.
GaEul!
EunJae teacher said before, that because she did everything that was within her power, that she has no regrets.
Thank you.
For giving me the chance to do everything I could
If I hear from Jandi, I will inform you. Bye.
What can we do?
Mister, I am so afraid that our Jun-Pyo might really become broken. I'm really afraid.
Miss.. you can't be like this also..
No.
This time...
I have a really bad feeling about this.
Miss?
Dad.... Dad...
DAD!!!!
How could you do this?
Can't you see it's already hard without you screaming about it?
Mom.... no, I don't even want to call you mom anymore. how..how could a person.. how could a person do something like that?!?
What exactly are you talking about??
How could you say that dad was dead when he's still alive?!
- You...
- How did I know?
You're wondering about that at a time like this? I'm asking you. Leaving Dad buried like that, did you intend to deceive me forever?!
Why did you do that?!
WHY?!
This is what your father would have wanted
W... W... What?
I said I will take care of everything, but your dad suddenly collapsed. He isn't different from a living corpse.
The head of the famous ShinHwa Group, I couldn't allow the last memories of him to become like that.
My pride wouldn't allow it.
Pride... Now...
Are you saying that you lied to the world and even to your children that my living father was dead because of your pride?
It was for your dad.
What is this about?
JunPyo....
I'll explain everything.
I...
I'm asking what does it mean? When dad is not around what you have to do?
I have to take care of mother, sister, and Shinhwa group!
Goo Junpyo, can you promise me that as a man to man? Yes, sir!
Your father tried his hardest till the very end for this group, which you can throw away any minute.
Are you thinking of abandoning him as well?
I'm sorry, young master. i am really sorry.
This time, it was me who realized that you and I were from two different worlds.
As much as you try to deny it, you are still Shinhwa Group's Goo JunPyo.
I haven't once forgotten that
I have come to the fish market today. Everyone look at the fresh fish here.
The stall is full of fish. - Look at this octopus.&lt;Br&gt;- $10!
- It seems this is the season for octopus. - $10!
Sure! It's drop-dead delicious! I'll give it to you for cheap, so buy some.
I'm going to see dad.
Will you go with me?
I'm not going.
Junpyo...
Junpyo
Come talk with Mom.
Mom ?
Do you really think that you were even once my mom?
Why don't you quit with the act of being a mother when it doesn't suit you, Chairwoman Kang. i have no interest.
What?
If you're going to go, go by yourself.
Goo Junpyo
JunPyo, are you serious?
Don't be like this. Go and see her once.
I said I'm not interested!
I'll ask you one more time.
Are you sure?
If you miss her so much, you should go.
Then I'm going first.
Whether you go or not, you do whatever you want.
When times are like this, don't you need Geum Jan Di the most?
What can I do by bringing her back here?
There is nothing that I can promise her....promising her that I'd always make her laugh, ...that I'd always make her happy so just trust in me I've lost the confidence to keep those kinds of promises.
The fact that I am the son of that kind of person... ...the fact that I am a member of that kind of family... ...even I hate it so much...how do you think she feels?
With all that she's had to endure already, I'm sure she really hates it.
It's Geum JanDi, so the situation can be different.
That's even more reason not to.
Because it's the woman that I love.
That's why it's not going to happen even more now.
It would have been nice if we sold the rest of that
Mom, I'm hungry!
Oh, I'm sorry, San.
I will have it ready soon.
What's going on?
What's going on?
That's what we want to ask you.
There's a limit to your thinking what dumb country folk we are!
What kind of scam are you trying to pull?
A scam?
You said you were the future daughter-in-law of ShinHwa Group!
My daughter says that there is someone else who is the future daughter-in-law.
See this?
This lady is the heiress to a group much bigger than ShinHwa!
The fact that they were going to get married was even on the news!
That's old news.
What?
So you mean you're really the future daughter-in-law of ShinHwa?
Well, that's not quite it either.
We don't care!
Just give us back the money that you borrowed right now!!
What? Right now?
Yes!
You never know...you just might run away in the middle of the night tonight! That's right! Look at what you've already just sat around and received!
Pay us even the interest right now!!!
Why all of a sudden.....
I'll pay it.
Sunbae..
Oh... that... that... master is... That money.... ...I'll repay it.
What should we do?
Did you see that, see that?
I guess it was true that she had a rich future son-in-law!
So is he the heir of ShinHwa Group?
Oh, just look at his face! He had a sense of nobility flowing out of him!
Oh, my...I've never seen such a handsome Young Master.. I envy them.
I'm not going to die alone. I'm not going to die alone!
How did you know that I was here?
I heard it.... ...the emergency bell...
I tossed and turned every night afraid that I wouldn't be able to hear it...
How can this happen?
How can a person do such a thing?
I...have received so much from you, Sunbae...
But you have given me more...
How is Grandpa doing?
The usual...attending to work...probably will continue until he collapses again...
That is so like him....
Grandpa gave me this.
It was what my Grandma gave my mother.
Sunbae.
I don't know when I started to feel like this. but...
I cannot live without you.
I cannot accept this.
Jandi...
I told myself I can forget it....
I thought I had forgotten it all.
However
However...
I can't seem to be able to throw this away.
I just can't seem to let it go....
I can't separate Goo JunPyo from me.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry sunbae.
It's ok.
It's ok.
Jandi...I can't give her up.
Even though I always make things hard for her.
I've sometimes thought it might be better to let her go to you. no
If I had to give Jandi to another guy I don't even want to think about it, but if I have to,
I thought you should the one.
It can't be anyone else but you, Jihoo
I've thought about that.
I won't die alone.
I will see to ShinHwa's end!
I won't go down alone.
NO!
Jun Pyo.
JunPyo!
JunPyo!
JunPyo!
Yah, Goo JunPyo.
Wake up.
Goo JunPyo! The assailant who was caught at the scene said he was done wrong by ShinHwa Group and did it as an act of revenge on hostile takeover.
This isn't your fault.
This isn't your fault.
Goo JunPyo!
Wake up!
Hello?
My friend is dying.
I said my friend is dying!
JunPyo...
Jun Pyo!
Wake up.
Yah!!
Wake Up!!
Breaking news. Tonight at 8 p.m., in a coastal town, the heir to ShinHwa Group, Goo JunPyo, was... ...was the victim of an assault and... ...has sent shock throughout.
Is this what you wanted? is this really what you wanted?
Miss, please calm down.
You said in the end, it was all for JunPyo.
That you were handing all ShinHwa Group's assets to JunPyo.
Look...look at what your so-called future happiness has done to your son.
Mother, do you have a single idea as to what your son likes to eat, what he likes, what he wants to become?
The surgery went well.
The critical part is over.
That's good.
Let's Go.
What did you say?
There's an urgent meeting in Hong Kong.
Was it not enough with just Dad?
Answer me what is more important to you..ShinHwa or JunPyo.
Answer me!
JunPyo ...he loves rolled up egg and ramen..
He especially loves eating fish cakes from street vendors.
He can eat 20 at one sitting.
He likes packing lunch and going on a picnic...
With the telescope that his parents bought him.... ...he also loves to star gaze.
Don't worry...
Goo JunPyo
He's gonna be okay.
JunPyo...
JunPyo..
Are you okay?...
JunPyo..
JunPyo
JunPyo, it's your sister...
JunPyo got transferred to a room.
Why don't you go?
If he knows you're next to him, he'll wake up soon.
Stop here for a minute.
Mom, do you have any idea what your son likes to eat, what he likes to do,what he wants to do?
JunPyo.... ...he loves rolled up egg and ramen...
He especially likes eating fish cakes from street vendors...
He can eat 20 at one sitting.
Move on.
I don't know when I started to feel this way. But...
I cannot live without you.
JunPyo.. JunPyo
I told you so, didn't I?
If not you, no one else...
Grandfather
Jihoo...
Grandfather
Ok..ok
Say it.
Aside from Shinhwa and being a plutocrat...
Have you ever seen me... as just a normal guy?
No
No matter how much you struggle, you're still Shinhwa Group's Goo Jun Pyo.
I never forgot that, not even for a single moment.
Goo JunPyo
Can you hear me?
I lied to you again.
To me, you no matter what, are Goo JunPyo.
Goo JunPyo...the idiot who likes this Geum Jandi who's not cute, has no money...no status...
So wake up.
Wake up. wake up Goo junPyo
Goo JunPyo Hubby.. Oh, Honey!
Yo..my bro..welcome back.
Thank you For what? For being alive.
It is definitely JunPyo.
Look at him, he's saying it was an unnatural death.
JanDi...why are you just standing there? Come here. You were really worried, weren't you?
Thank Goodness...
Goo JunPyo.
But who is that dorky-looking girl? JunPyo. You don't remember Geum Jan Di?
Ji Hoo, is she your girl?
It's a partial memory loss.
For the patient, anything really stressful before the accident, he's forgotten. But how is it possible that he can't remember just one person? It's possible that memories regarding her are too painful or just too important.. so if he concentrates on it too much, it could be erased selectively.
You Who do you think you are that you can come in anytime when you please? Hm?
Yah!
I'm not anyone's girl! Well...more than JiHoo sunbae's, I'm more...your...
Get lost. Are you hard of hearing or something? I said get out!
Goo JunPyo Can you go out? I want to rest.
Come out! I said come out!! I said come out!!
You got to hit the vending machine only then it works.
Thank you It seems like you've been admitted at this hospital for a while...
What's your name?
Yumi...Jang Yumi.
A junior at Korea High.
I'm Geum JanDi
ShinHwa High, Senior. You go to ShinHwa High?
Oh, that's just so great! But who are you here to visit? A friend.., OH, I see..
Yumi...you have such a vibrant personality..
It's just that I get annoyed with people who are at hospitals who are sad or high strung... I don't like that. So how should one be towards people like that?
For people how have been admitted for a long time and they're a little high strung and sensitive... Just naturally....
Naturally? You over there! Are you ok?
Oppa?
You want to ride a wheelchair?
Don't concern yourself.
Then do you do want to borrow my crutches?
Oppa, do you know how to use crutches?
Hey, you little brat...don't act like we know each other and just go away.
Oppa, your personality is pretty bad, isn't it?
I'm not a little brat.
I'm Yumi, Jang Yumi.
What?
You're the oppa that's in that VlP room, aren't you?
I don't know what great person you are... but a patient is just another patient.
Oh, wait..not quite.
At this hospital, Yumi is a sunbae!
If you don't want to break the remaining leg... ..I'd suggest you lean on me.
No, Yumi! Your leg is injured.
Let me help.
Unni, see you next time!
So how about shocking him with something...or... ...recreating some important event in the past?
Such as?
Of all the incidents with Geum JanDi, what was the event that had the most impact?
Goo JunPyo
What's with this girl?
What the hell are you trying to do?!
If you come back to your senses, call me.
What?
Are you some kind of crazy girl?
What kind of woman are you?
JunPyo
Don't you remember anything?
What the hell am I supposed to remember!?
What kind of bad luck is this with this bum-like chick...
Has it been too long ago?
No.
I think this incident was too weak.
Next time, let's try something stronger.
Stronger?
Didn't I tell you I was at the limits of my patience?
Yah! Who the hell do you think you're messing with?
Just because you're Ji Hoo's girlfriend, doesn't mean I'm going to hold back!
Goo JunPyo.
I'm warning you. I'm not going to go soft on you!
I've warned you!
Hey JiHoo
I don't ever want to see this crazy girl again!
Do you hear me?
Don't worry.
You're not someone that can be forgotten that easily.
Maybe because it was so hard on him that he wanted to forget.
If it was a bond that could be forgotten just because you want to forget... ...would it have been easier?
No way!
Who in the world gets special crutches??
I'm telling you the truth.
Do you really think Goo JunPyo will use any old crutches?
Here...you hold it. oh, seriously...why is this thing so light?
This is what's called titanium.
That's really funny, Oppa.
JunPyo
Oh JiHoo
Oh, you were there?
JanDI unnie
Hello..
Unni, did you see JunPyo oppa's crutches?
It's titanium...pretty funny, huh?
It's not like he's Iron Man or anything...
Jandi unni's friend is so handsome.
Hello. I'm Jang Yumi.
Nice to meet you.
It's cold. Let's go back inside.
Who is it?
I have brought Pizza.
It'll be so great if I can see it through a telescope or something....
Oppa, do you like stars? Stars?
The brightest star in winter... ...in other words, like Goo JunPyo.
Then, I am this star.
Oppa. What's wrong?
Are you hurting somewhere?
There's something important that I seem to have forgotten.
I can't remember it.
My chest feels so tight that I feel like I'm going to burst...
Don't stress too much over it.
If it's important, then it will come back eventually...
And if it doesn't come back, doesn't it mean that it wasn't really that important to being with?
If you keep stressing about it, it won't be good for you physically.
Yo..What's up?
Are you okay?
Hello..
We meet again.
We are H.C.
H.C.??
Hospital couple.
All the patients and the nurses basically gave us that official title.
What do you think?
Do we suit each other?
Jun Pyo
Do you still not remember anything ?
What exactly am I supposed to remember?
Geum JanDi
You don't remember?
So why do you keep talking about Jandi or something?!
I mean why should I remember your girl?
Oh, forget it!
I don't know where you met this girl...so unsophisticated..
What does she think she is...a gang member or something?
Just make sure she doesn't come in and out of my hospital room.
Goo JunPyo
Please Stop.
What is wrong with him?
SunBae
I'll bring tea.
I'm sorry
Why should you be sorry?
I'm the one who is sorry.
I got so mad without even my knowing...
I didn't stop you because I thought JunPyo would be hurt...
If you hit him, I thought you would be hurt more, emotionally.
That's why I stopped you .
How long did you wait outside?
Why are your hands so cold? Let me see the one that's cold is your heart.
You don't have to pretend to be strong in front of me.
I'm not pretending to be strong.
It's because you're here.
You being here gives me strength.
I'll go make tea.
Abracadabra,Gu JunPyo, remember Geum JanDi.
I remember.
The thing I forgot is... you, right?
It's all over now.
That in this ridiculous way... ...you guys are ending....
I can't go along with it.
That girl's facial expression...I can't seem to erase...
In the end... Geum JanDi and Goo JunPyo... ...only amounted to this...
This is all it amounted to..
We have gathered you all here to announce something special.
Goo JunPyo and Jang Yumi, we have decided to go study in the US next month.
THE ADVENTURES OF SHERLOCK HOLMES by
SlR ARTHUR CONAN DOYLE
ADVENTURE I.
A SCANDAL IN BOHEMlA
I.
To Sherlock Holmes she is always THE woman. I have seldom heard him mention her under any other name.
In his eyes she eclipses and predominates the whole of her sex.
It was not that he felt any emotion akin to love for Irene Adler.
All emotions, and that one particularly, were abhorrent to his cold, precise but admirably balanced mind.
He was, I take it, the most perfect reasoning and observing machine that the world has seen, but as a lover he would have placed himself in a false position.
He never spoke of the softer passions, save with a gibe and a sneer.
They were admirable things for the observer--excellent for drawing the veil from men's motives and actions.
But for the trained reasoner to admit such intrusions into his own delicate and finely adjusted temperament was to introduce a distracting factor which might throw a doubt upon all his mental results.
Grit in a sensitive instrument, or a crack in one of his own high-power lenses, would not be more disturbing than a strong emotion in a nature such as his.
And yet there was but one woman to him, and that woman was the late Irene Adler, of dubious and questionable memory.
I had seen little of Holmes lately.
My marriage had drifted us away from each other.
My own complete happiness, and the home- centred interests which rise up around the man who first finds himself master of his own establishment, were sufficient to absorb all my attention, while Holmes, who
loathed every form of society with his whole Bohemian soul, remained in our
lodgings in Baker Street, buried among his old books, and alternating from week to week between cocaine and ambition, the drowsiness of the drug, and the fierce energy of his own keen nature.
He was still, as ever, deeply attracted by the study of crime, and occupied his immense faculties and extraordinary powers of observation in following out those clues, and clearing up those mysteries which had been abandoned as hopeless by the official police.
From time to time I heard some vague account of his doings: of his summons to
Odessa in the case of the Trepoff murder, of his clearing up of the singular tragedy of the Atkinson brothers at Trincomalee, and finally of the mission which he had accomplished so delicately and successfully for the reigning family of Holland.
Beyond these signs of his activity, however, which I merely shared with all the readers of the daily press, I knew little of my former friend and companion.
One night--it was on the twentieth of
March, 1888--I was returning from a journey to a patient (for I had now returned to civil practice), when my way led me through
Baker Street.
As I passed the well-remembered door, which must always be associated in my mind with my wooing, and with the dark incidents of the Study in Scarlet, I was seized with a keen desire to see Holmes again, and to know how he was employing his extraordinary powers.
His rooms were brilliantly lit, and, even as I looked up, I saw his tall, spare figure pass twice in a dark silhouette against the blind.
He was pacing the room swiftly, eagerly, with his head sunk upon his chest and his hands clasped behind him.
To me, who knew his every mood and habit, his attitude and manner told their own story.
He was at work again.
He had risen out of his drug-created dreams and was hot upon the scent of some new problem.
I rang the bell and was shown up to the chamber which had formerly been in part my own.
His manner was not effusive.
It seldom was; but he was glad, I think, to see me.
With hardly a word spoken, but with a kindly eye, he waved me to an armchair, threw across his case of cigars, and indicated a spirit case and a gasogene in the corner.
Then he stood before the fire and looked me over in his singular introspective fashion.
"Wedlock suits you," he remarked.
"I think, Watson, that you have put on seven and a half pounds since I saw you."
"Seven!"
I answered.
"Indeed, I should have thought a little more.
Just a trifle more, I fancy, Watson.
And in practice again, I observe. You did not tell me that you intended to go into harness."
"Then, how do you know?"
"I see it, I deduce it.
How do I know that you have been getting yourself very wet lately, and that you have a most clumsy and careless servant girl?"
"My dear Holmes," said I, "this is too much.
You would certainly have been burned, had you lived a few centuries ago.
It is true that I had a country walk on
Thursday and came home in a dreadful mess, but as I have changed my clothes I can't imagine how you deduce it.
As to Mary Jane, she is incorrigible, and my wife has given her notice, but there, again, I fail to see how you work it out."
He chuckled to himself and rubbed his long, nervous hands together.
"It is simplicity itself," said he; "my eyes tell me that on the inside of your left shoe, just where the firelight strikes it, the leather is scored by six almost parallel cuts.
Obviously they have been caused by someone who has very carelessly scraped round the edges of the sole in order to remove crusted mud from it.
Hence, you see, my double deduction that you had been out in vile weather, and that you had a particularly malignant boot- slitting specimen of the London slavey.
As to your practice, if a gentleman walks into my rooms smelling of iodoform, with a black mark of nitrate of silver upon his right forefinger, and a bulge on the right side of his top-hat to show where he has secreted his stethoscope, I must be dull, indeed, if I do not pronounce him to be an active member of the medical profession." I could not help laughing at the ease with which he explained his process of deduction.
"When I hear you give your reasons," I remarked, "the thing always appears to me to be so ridiculously simple that I could easily do it myself, though at each successive instance of your reasoning I am baffled until you explain your process.
And yet I believe that my eyes are as good as yours."
"Quite so," he answered, lighting a cigarette, and throwing himself down into an armchair.
"You see, but you do not observe.
The distinction is clear.
For example, you have frequently seen the steps which lead up from the hall to this room."
"Frequently."
"How often?"
"Well, some hundreds of times."
"Then how many are there?"
"How many?
I don't know."
"Quite so!
You have not observed.
And yet you have seen.
That is just my point.
Now, I know that there are seventeen steps, because I have both seen and observed.
By-the-way, since you are interested in these little problems, and since you are good enough to chronicle one or two of my trifling experiences, you may be interested in this."
He threw over a sheet of thick, pink-tinted note-paper which had been lying open upon the table.
"It came by the last post," said he.
"Read it aloud."
The note was undated, and without either signature or address.
"There will call upon you to-night, at a quarter to eight o'clock," it said, "a gentleman who desires to consult you upon a matter of the very deepest moment.
Your recent services to one of the royal houses of Europe have shown that you are one who may safely be trusted with matters which are of an importance which can hardly be exaggerated.
This account of you we have from all quarters received.
Be in your chamber then at that hour, and do not take it amiss if your visitor wear a mask."
"This is indeed a mystery," I remarked.
"What do you imagine that it means?"
"I have no data yet.
It is a capital mistake to theorize before one has data.
Insensibly one begins to twist facts to suit theories, instead of theories to suit facts.
But the note itself.
What do you deduce from it?"
I carefully examined the writing, and the paper upon which it was written.
"The man who wrote it was presumably well to do," I remarked, endeavouring to imitate my companion's processes.
"Such paper could not be bought under half a crown a packet.
It is peculiarly strong and stiff."
"Peculiar--that is the very word," said
Holmes.
"It is not an English paper at all.
Hold it up to the light."
I did so, and saw a large "E" with a small
"g," a "P," and a large "G" with a small
"t" woven into the texture of the paper.
"What do you make of that?" asked Holmes.
"The name of the maker, no doubt; or his monogram, rather."
"Not at all.
The 'G' with the small 't' stands for
'Gesellschaft,' which is the German for
'Company.'
It is a customary contraction like our
'Co.'
'P,' of course, stands for 'Papier.'
Now for the 'Eg.'
Let us glance at our Continental
Gazetteer."
He took down a heavy brown volume from his shelves.
"Eglow, Eglonitz--here we are, Egria.
It is in a German-speaking country--in
Bohemia, not far from Carlsbad.
'Remarkable as being the scene of the death of Wallenstein, and for its numerous glass- factories and paper-mills.'
Ha, ha, my boy, what do you make of that?"
His eyes sparkled, and he sent up a great blue triumphant cloud from his cigarette.
"The paper was made in Bohemia," I said.
"Precisely.
And the man who wrote the note is a German.
Do you note the peculiar construction of the sentence--'This account of you we have from all quarters received.'
A Frenchman or Russian could not have written that.
It is the German who is so uncourteous to his verbs.
It only remains, therefore, to discover what is wanted by this German who writes upon Bohemian paper and prefers wearing a mask to showing his face.
And here he comes, if I am not mistaken, to resolve all our doubts."
As he spoke there was the sharp sound of horses' hoofs and grating wheels against the curb, followed by a sharp pull at the bell.
Holmes whistled.
"A pair, by the sound," said he.
"Yes," he continued, glancing out of the window.
"A nice little brougham and a pair of beauties.
A hundred and fifty guineas apiece.
There's money in this case, Watson, if there is nothing else."
"I think that I had better go, Holmes."
"Not a bit, Doctor.
Stay where you are.
I am lost without my Boswell.
And this promises to be interesting.
It would be a pity to miss it."
"But your client--"
"Never mind him.
I may want your help, and so may he.
Here he comes.
Sit down in that armchair, Doctor, and give us your best attention."
A slow and heavy step, which had been heard upon the stairs and in the passage, paused immediately outside the door.
Then there was a loud and authoritative tap.
"Come in!" said Holmes.
A man entered who could hardly have been less than six feet six inches in height, with the chest and limbs of a Hercules.
His dress was rich with a richness which would, in England, be looked upon as akin to bad taste.
Heavy bands of astrakhan were slashed across the sleeves and fronts of his double-breasted coat, while the deep blue cloak which was thrown over his shoulders was lined with flame-coloured silk and secured at the neck with a brooch which consisted of a single flaming beryl.
Boots which extended halfway up his calves, and which were trimmed at the tops with rich brown fur, completed the impression of barbaric opulence which was suggested by his whole appearance.
He carried a broad-brimmed hat in his hand, while he wore across the upper part of his face, extending down past the cheekbones, a black vizard mask, which he had apparently adjusted that very moment, for his hand was still raised to it as he entered.
From the lower part of the face he appeared to be a man of strong character, with a thick, hanging lip, and a long, straight chin suggestive of resolution pushed to the length of obstinacy.
"You had my note?" he asked with a deep harsh voice and a strongly marked German accent.
"I told you that I would call."
He looked from one to the other of us, as if uncertain which to address.
"Pray take a seat," said Holmes.
"This is my friend and colleague, Dr.
Watson, who is occasionally good enough to help me in my cases.
Whom have I the honour to address?"
"You may address me as the Count Von Kramm, a Bohemian nobleman.
I understand that this gentleman, your friend, is a man of honour and discretion, whom I may trust with a matter of the most extreme importance.
If not, I should much prefer to communicate with you alone."
I rose to go, but Holmes caught me by the wrist and pushed me back into my chair.
"It is both, or none," said he.
"You may say before this gentleman anything which you may say to me."
The Count shrugged his broad shoulders.
"Then I must begin," said he, "by binding you both to absolute secrecy for two years; at the end of that time the matter will be of no importance.
At present it is not too much to say that it is of such weight it may have an influence upon European history."
"I promise," said Holmes.
"And I."
"You will excuse this mask," continued our strange visitor.
"The august person who employs me wishes his agent to be unknown to you, and I may confess at once that the title by which I have just called myself is not exactly my own."
"I was aware of it," said Holmes dryly.
"The circumstances are of great delicacy, and every precaution has to be taken to quench what might grow to be an immense scandal and seriously compromise one of the reigning families of Europe.
To speak plainly, the matter implicates the great House of Ormstein, hereditary kings of Bohemia."
"I was also aware of that," murmured
Holmes, settling himself down in his armchair and closing his eyes.
Our visitor glanced with some apparent surprise at the languid, lounging figure of the man who had been no doubt depicted to him as the most incisive reasoner and most energetic agent in Europe.
Holmes slowly reopened his eyes and looked impatiently at his gigantic client.
"If your Majesty would condescend to state your case," he remarked, "I should be better able to advise you."
The man sprang from his chair and paced up and down the room in uncontrollable agitation.
Then, with a gesture of desperation, he tore the mask from his face and hurled it upon the ground.
"You are right," he cried; "I am the King.
Why should I attempt to conceal it?"
"Why, indeed?" murmured Holmes.
"Your Majesty had not spoken before I was aware that I was addressing Wilhelm
Gottsreich Sigismond von Ormstein, Grand
Duke of Cassel-Felstein, and hereditary
King of Bohemia."
"But you can understand," said our strange visitor, sitting down once more and passing his hand over his high white forehead, "you can understand that I am not accustomed to doing such business in my own person.
Yet the matter was so delicate that I could not confide it to an agent without putting myself in his power.
I have come incognito from Prague for the purpose of consulting you."
"Then, pray consult," said Holmes, shutting his eyes once more.
"The facts are briefly these:
Some five years ago, during a lengthy visit to
Warsaw, I made the acquaintance of the well-known adventuress, Irene Adler.
The name is no doubt familiar to you."
"Kindly look her up in my index, Doctor," murmured Holmes without opening his eyes.
For many years he had adopted a system of docketing all paragraphs concerning men and things, so that it was difficult to name a subject or a person on which he could not at once furnish information.
In this case I found her biography sandwiched in between that of a Hebrew rabbi and that of a staff-commander who had written a monograph upon the deep-sea fishes.
"Let me see!" said Holmes.
"Hum!
Born in New Jersey in the year 1858.
Contralto--hum!
La Scala, hum!
Prima donna Imperial Opera of Warsaw--yes!
Retired from operatic stage--ha!
Living in London--quite so!
Your Majesty, as I understand, became entangled with this young person, wrote her some compromising letters, and is now desirous of getting those letters back."
"Precisely so.
But how--"
"Was there a secret marriage?"
"None."
"No legal papers or certificates?"
"None."
"Then I fail to follow your Majesty.
If this young person should produce her letters for blackmailing or other purposes, how is she to prove their authenticity?"
"There is the writing."
"Pooh, pooh!
Forgery."
"My private note-paper."
"Stolen."
"My own seal."
"Imitated."
"My photograph."
"Bought."
"We were both in the photograph."
"Oh, dear!
That is very bad!
Your Majesty has indeed committed an indiscretion."
"I was mad--insane."
"You have compromised yourself seriously."
"I was only Crown Prince then.
I was young. I am but thirty now."
"It must be recovered."
"We have tried and failed."
"Your Majesty must pay.
It must be bought."
"She will not sell."
"Stolen, then."
"Five attempts have been made.
Twice burglars in my pay ransacked her house.
Once we diverted her luggage when she travelled.
Twice she has been waylaid.
There has been no result."
"No sign of it?"
"Absolutely none."
Holmes laughed.
"It is quite a pretty little problem," said he.
"But a very serious one to me," returned the King reproachfully.
"Very, indeed.
And what does she propose to do with the photograph?"
"To ruin me."
"But how?"
"I am about to be married."
"So I have heard."
"To Clotilde Lothman von Saxe-Meningen, second daughter of the King of Scandinavia.
You may know the strict principles of her family.
She is herself the very soul of delicacy.
A shadow of a doubt as to my conduct would bring the matter to an end."
"And Irene Adler?"
"Threatens to send them the photograph.
And she will do it. I know that she will do it.
You do not know her, but she has a soul of steel.
She has the face of the most beautiful of women, and the mind of the most resolute of men.
Rather than I should marry another woman, there are no lengths to which she would not go--none."
"You are sure that she has not sent it yet?"
"I am sure."
"And why?"
"Because she has said that she would send it on the day when the betrothal was publicly proclaimed.
That will be next Monday."
"Oh, then we have three days yet," said
Holmes with a yawn.
"That is very fortunate, as I have one or two matters of importance to look into just at present.
Your Majesty will, of course, stay in
London for the present?"
"Certainly.
You will find me at the Langham under the name of the Count Von Kramm."
"Then I shall drop you a line to let you know how we progress."
"Pray do so. I shall be all anxiety."
"Then, as to money?"
"You have carte blanche."
"Absolutely?"
"I tell you that I would give one of the provinces of my kingdom to have that photograph."
"And for present expenses?"
The King took a heavy chamois leather bag from under his cloak and laid it on the table.
"There are three hundred pounds in gold and seven hundred in notes," he said.
Holmes scribbled a receipt upon a sheet of his note-book and handed it to him.
"And Mademoiselle's address?" he asked.
"Is Briony Lodge, Serpentine Avenue, St.
John's Wood."
Holmes took a note of it.
"One other question," said he.
"Was the photograph a cabinet?"
"It was."
"Then, good-night, your Majesty, and I trust that we shall soon have some good news for you.
And good-night, Watson," he added, as the wheels of the royal brougham rolled down the street.
"If you will be good enough to call to- morrow afternoon at three o'clock I should like to chat this little matter over with you."
Il.
At three o'clock precisely I was at Baker
Street, but Holmes had not yet returned.
The landlady informed me that he had left the house shortly after eight o'clock in the morning.
I sat down beside the fire, however, with the intention of awaiting him, however long he might be.
I was already deeply interested in his inquiry, for, though it was surrounded by none of the grim and strange features which were associated with the two crimes which I have already recorded, still, the nature of the case and the exalted station of his client gave it a character of its own.
Indeed, apart from the nature of the investigation which my friend had on hand, there was something in his masterly grasp of a situation, and his keen, incisive reasoning, which made it a pleasure to me to study his system of work, and to follow the quick, subtle methods by which he disentangled the most inextricable mysteries.
So accustomed was I to his invariable success that the very possibility of his failing had ceased to enter into my head.
It was close upon four before the door opened, and a drunken-looking groom, ill- kempt and side-whiskered, with an inflamed face and disreputable clothes, walked into the room.
Accustomed as I was to my friend's amazing powers in the use of disguises, I had to look three times before I was certain that it was indeed he.
With a nod he vanished into the bedroom, whence he emerged in five minutes tweed- suited and respectable, as of old.
Putting his hands into his pockets, he stretched out his legs in front of the fire and laughed heartily for some minutes.
"Well, really!" he cried, and then he choked and laughed again until he was obliged to lie back, limp and helpless, in the chair.
"What is it?"
"It's quite too funny. I am sure you could never guess how I employed my morning, or what I ended by doing."
"I can't imagine. I suppose that you have been watching the habits, and perhaps the house, of Miss
Irene Adler."
"Quite so; but the sequel was rather unusual. I will tell you, however.
I left the house a little after eight o'clock this morning in the character of a groom out of work.
There is a wonderful sympathy and freemasonry among horsey men.
Be one of them, and you will know all that there is to know.
I soon found Briony Lodge.
It is a bijou villa, with a garden at the back, but built out in front right up to the road, two stories.
Chubb lock to the door.
Large sitting-room on the right side, well furnished, with long windows almost to the floor, and those preposterous English window fasteners which a child could open.
Behind there was nothing remarkable, save that the passage window could be reached from the top of the coach-house.
I walked round it and examined it closely from every point of view, but without noting anything else of interest.
"I then lounged down the street and found, as I expected, that there was a mews in a
lane which runs down by one wall of the garden.
I lent the ostlers a hand in rubbing down their horses, and received in exchange twopence, a glass of half and half, two fills of shag tobacco, and as much information as I could desire about Miss
Adler, to say nothing of half a dozen other people in the neighbourhood in whom I was not in the least interested, but whose biographies I was compelled to listen to."
"And what of Irene Adler?"
I asked.
"Oh, she has turned all the men's heads down in that part.
She is the daintiest thing under a bonnet on this planet.
So say the Serpentine-mews, to a man.
She lives quietly, sings at concerts, drives out at five every day, and returns at seven sharp for dinner.
Seldom goes out at other times, except when she sings.
Has only one male visitor, but a good deal of him.
He is dark, handsome, and dashing, never calls less than once a day, and often twice.
He is a Mr. Godfrey Norton, of the Inner
Temple.
See the advantages of a cabman as a confidant.
They had driven him home a dozen times from
Serpentine-mews, and knew all about him.
When I had listened to all they had to tell, I began to walk up and down near
Briony Lodge once more, and to think over my plan of campaign.
"This Godfrey Norton was evidently an important factor in the matter.
He was a lawyer.
That sounded ominous.
What was the relation between them, and what the object of his repeated visits?
Was she his client, his friend, or his mistress?
If the former, she had probably transferred the photograph to his keeping.
If the latter, it was less likely.
On the issue of this question depended whether I should continue my work at Briony
Lodge, or turn my attention to the gentleman's chambers in the Temple.
It was a delicate point, and it widened the field of my inquiry.
I fear that I bore you with these details, but I have to let you see my little difficulties, if you are to understand the situation."
"I am following you closely," I answered.
"I was still balancing the matter in my mind when a hansom cab drove up to Briony
Lodge, and a gentleman sprang out.
He was a remarkably handsome man, dark, aquiline, and moustached--evidently the man of whom I had heard.
He appeared to be in a great hurry, shouted to the cabman to wait, and brushed past the maid who opened the door with the air of a man who was thoroughly at home.
"He was in the house about half an hour, and I could catch glimpses of him in the windows of the sitting-room, pacing up and down, talking excitedly, and waving his arms.
Of her I could see nothing.
Presently he emerged, looking even more flurried than before.
As he stepped up to the cab, he pulled a gold watch from his pocket and looked at it earnestly, 'Drive like the devil,' he shouted, 'first to Gross &amp; Hankey's in
Regent Street, and then to the Church of
St. Monica in the Edgeware Road.
Half a guinea if you do it in twenty minutes!'
"Away they went, and I was just wondering whether I should not do well to follow them when up the lane came a neat little landau, the coachman with his coat only half- buttoned, and his tie under his ear, while all the tags of his harness were sticking out of the buckles.
It hadn't pulled up before she shot out of the hall door and into it.
I only caught a glimpse of her at the moment, but she was a lovely woman, with a face that a man might die for. "'The Church of St. Monica, John,' she cried, 'and half a sovereign if you reach it in twenty minutes.'
"This was quite too good to lose, Watson.
I was just balancing whether I should run for it, or whether I should perch behind her landau when a cab came through the street.
The driver looked twice at such a shabby fare, but I jumped in before he could object.
'The Church of St. Monica,' said I, 'and half a sovereign if you reach it in twenty minutes.'
It was twenty-five minutes to twelve, and of course it was clear enough what was in the wind.
"My cabby drove fast.
I don't think I ever drove faster, but the others were there before us.
The cab and the landau with their steaming horses were in front of the door when I arrived.
I paid the man and hurried into the church.
There was not a soul there save the two whom I had followed and a surpliced clergyman, who seemed to be expostulating with them.
They were all three standing in a knot in front of the altar.
I lounged up the side aisle like any other idler who has dropped into a church.
Suddenly, to my surprise, the three at the altar faced round to me, and Godfrey Norton came running as hard as he could towards me. "'Thank God,' he cried.
'You'll do.
Come!
Come!' "'What then?'
I asked. "'Come, man, come, only three minutes, or it won't be legal.'
"I was half-dragged up to the altar, and before I knew where I was I found myself mumbling responses which were whispered in my ear, and vouching for things of which I knew nothing, and generally assisting in the secure tying up of Irene Adler, spinster, to Godfrey Norton, bachelor.
It was all done in an instant, and there was the gentleman thanking me on the one side and the lady on the other, while the clergyman beamed on me in front.
It was the most preposterous position in which I ever found myself in my life, and it was the thought of it that started me laughing just now.
It seems that there had been some informality about their license, that the clergyman absolutely refused to marry them without a witness of some sort, and that my lucky appearance saved the bridegroom from having to sally out into the streets in search of a best man. The bride gave me a sovereign, and I mean to wear it on my watch-chain in memory of the occasion."
"This is a very unexpected turn of affairs," said I; "and what then?"
"Well, I found my plans very seriously menaced.
It looked as if the pair might take an immediate departure, and so necessitate very prompt and energetic measures on my part.
At the church door, however, they separated, he driving back to the Temple, and she to her own house.
'I shall drive out in the park at five as usual,' she said as she left him.
I heard no more.
They drove away in different directions, and I went off to make my own arrangements."
"Which are?"
"Some cold beef and a glass of beer," he answered, ringing the bell.
"I have been too busy to think of food, and
I am likely to be busier still this evening.
By the way, Doctor, I shall want your co- operation."
"I shall be delighted."
"You don't mind breaking the law?"
"Not in the least."
"Nor running a chance of arrest?"
"Not in a good cause."
"Oh, the cause is excellent!"
"Then I am your man."
"I was sure that I might rely on you."
"But what is it you wish?"
"When Mrs. Turner has brought in the tray I will make it clear to you.
Now," he said as he turned hungrily on the simple fare that our landlady had provided,
"I must discuss it while I eat, for I have not much time.
It is nearly five now.
In two hours we must be on the scene of action.
Miss Irene, or Madame, rather, returns from her drive at seven.
We must be at Briony Lodge to meet her."
"And what then?"
"You must leave that to me. I have already arranged what is to occur.
There is only one point on which I must insist.
You must not interfere, come what may.
You understand?"
"I am to be neutral?"
"To do nothing whatever.
There will probably be some small unpleasantness.
Do not join in it.
It will end in my being conveyed into the house.
Four or five minutes afterwards the sitting-room window will open.
You are to station yourself close to that open window."
"Yes."
"You are to watch me, for I will be visible to you."
"Yes."
"And when I raise my hand--so--you will throw into the room what I give you to throw, and will, at the same time, raise the cry of fire.
You quite follow me?"
"Entirely."
"It is nothing very formidable," he said, taking a long cigar-shaped roll from his pocket.
"It is an ordinary plumber's smoke-rocket, fitted with a cap at either end to make it self-lighting.
Your task is confined to that.
When you raise your cry of fire, it will be taken up by quite a number of people.
You may then walk to the end of the street, and I will rejoin you in ten minutes.
I hope that I have made myself clear?"
"I am to remain neutral, to get near the window, to watch you, and at the signal to throw in this object, then to raise the cry of fire, and to wait you at the corner of the street."
"Precisely."
"Then you may entirely rely on me."
"That is excellent. I think, perhaps, it is almost time that I prepare for the new role I have to play."
He disappeared into his bedroom and returned in a few minutes in the character of an amiable and simple-minded
Nonconformist clergyman.
His broad black hat, his baggy trousers, his white tie, his sympathetic smile, and general look of peering and benevolent curiosity were such as Mr. John Hare alone could have equalled.
It was not merely that Holmes changed his costume.
His expression, his manner, his very soul seemed to vary with every fresh part that he assumed.
The stage lost a fine actor, even as science lost an acute reasoner, when he became a specialist in crime.
It was a quarter past six when we left
Baker Street, and it still wanted ten minutes to the hour when we found ourselves in Serpentine Avenue.
It was already dusk, and the lamps were just being lighted as we paced up and down in front of Briony Lodge, waiting for the coming of its occupant.
The house was just such as I had pictured it from Sherlock Holmes' succinct description, but the locality appeared to be less private than I expected.
On the contrary, for a small street in a quiet neighbourhood, it was remarkably animated.
There was a group of shabbily dressed men smoking and laughing in a corner, a scissors-grinder with his wheel, two guardsmen who were flirting with a nurse- girl, and several well-dressed young men who were lounging up and down with cigars in their mouths.
"You see," remarked Holmes, as we paced to and fro in front of the house, "this marriage rather simplifies matters.
The photograph becomes a double-edged weapon now.
The chances are that she would be as averse to its being seen by Mr. Godfrey Norton, as our client is to its coming to the eyes of his princess.
Now the question is, Where are we to find the photograph?"
"Where, indeed?"
"It is most unlikely that she carries it about with her.
It is cabinet size.
Too large for easy concealment about a woman's dress.
She knows that the King is capable of having her waylaid and searched.
Two attempts of the sort have already been made.
We may take it, then, that she does not carry it about with her."
"Where, then?"
"Her banker or her lawyer.
There is that double possibility.
But I am inclined to think neither.
Women are naturally secretive, and they like to do their own secreting.
Why should she hand it over to anyone else?
She could trust her own guardianship, but she could not tell what indirect or political influence might be brought to bear upon a business man.
Besides, remember that she had resolved to use it within a few days.
It must be where she can lay her hands upon it.
It must be in her own house."
"But it has twice been burgled."
"Pshaw!
They did not know how to look."
"But how will you look?"
"I will not look."
"What then?"
"I will get her to show me."
"But she will refuse."
"She will not be able to.
But I hear the rumble of wheels.
It is her carriage.
Now carry out my orders to the letter."
As he spoke the gleam of the side-lights of a carriage came round the curve of the avenue.
It was a smart little landau which rattled up to the door of Briony Lodge.
As it pulled up, one of the loafing men at the corner dashed forward to open the door in the hope of earning a copper, but was elbowed away by another loafer, who had rushed up with the same intention.
A fierce quarrel broke out, which was increased by the two guardsmen, who took sides with one of the loungers, and by the scissors-grinder, who was equally hot upon the other side. A blow was struck, and in an instant the
lady, who had stepped from her carriage, was the centre of a little knot of flushed and struggling men, who struck savagely at each other with their fists and sticks.
Holmes dashed into the crowd to protect the
lady; but just as he reached her he gave a cry and dropped to the ground, with the blood running freely down his face.
At his fall the guardsmen took to their heels in one direction and the loungers in the other, while a number of better-dressed people, who had watched the scuffle without taking part in it, crowded in to help the
lady and to attend to the injured man.
Irene Adler, as I will still call her, had hurried up the steps; but she stood at the top with her superb figure outlined against the lights of the hall, looking back into the street.
"Is the poor gentleman much hurt?" she asked.
"He is dead," cried several voices.
"No, no, there's life in him!" shouted another.
"But he'll be gone before you can get him to hospital."
"He's a brave fellow," said a woman.
"They would have had the lady's purse and watch if it hadn't been for him.
They were a gang, and a rough one, too.
Ah, he's breathing now."
"He can't lie in the street.
May we bring him in, marm?"
"Surely.
Bring him into the sitting-room.
There is a comfortable sofa.
This way, please!"
Slowly and solemnly he was borne into
Briony Lodge and laid out in the principal room, while I still observed the proceedings from my post by the window.
The lamps had been lit, but the blinds had not been drawn, so that I could see Holmes as he lay upon the couch. I do not know whether he was seized with compunction at that moment for the part he was playing, but I know that I never felt more heartily ashamed of myself in my life than when I saw the beautiful creature against whom I was conspiring, or the grace and kindliness with which she waited upon the injured man.
And yet it would be the blackest treachery to Holmes to draw back now from the part which he had intrusted to me.
I hardened my heart, and took the smoke- rocket from under my ulster.
After all, I thought, we are not injuring her.
We are but preventing her from injuring another.
Holmes had sat up upon the couch, and I saw him motion like a man who is in need of air. A maid rushed across and threw open the window.
At the same instant I saw him raise his hand and at the signal I tossed my rocket into the room with a cry of "Fire!"
The word was no sooner out of my mouth than the whole crowd of spectators, well dressed and ill--gentlemen, ostlers, and servant- maids--joined in a general shriek of
"Fire!"
Thick clouds of smoke curled through the room and out at the open window.
I caught a glimpse of rushing figures, and a moment later the voice of Holmes from within assuring them that it was a false alarm.
Slipping through the shouting crowd I made my way to the corner of the street, and in ten minutes was rejoiced to find my friend's arm in mine, and to get away from the scene of uproar.
He walked swiftly and in silence for some few minutes until we had turned down one of the quiet streets which lead towards the
Edgeware Road.
"You did it very nicely, Doctor," he remarked.
"Nothing could have been better.
It is all right."
"You have the photograph?"
"I know where it is."
"And how did you find out?"
"She showed me, as I told you she would."
"I am still in the dark."
"I do not wish to make a mystery," said he, laughing.
"The matter was perfectly simple.
You, of course, saw that everyone in the street was an accomplice.
They were all engaged for the evening."
"I guessed as much."
"Then, when the row broke out, I had a little moist red paint in the palm of my hand.
I rushed forward, fell down, clapped my hand to my face, and became a piteous spectacle.
It is an old trick."
"That also I could fathom."
"Then they carried me in.
She was bound to have me in.
What else could she do?
And into her sitting-room, which was the very room which I suspected.
It lay between that and her bedroom, and I was determined to see which.
They laid me on a couch, I motioned for air, they were compelled to open the window, and you had your chance."
"How did that help you?"
"It was all-important.
When a woman thinks that her house is on fire, her instinct is at once to rush to the thing which she values most.
It is a perfectly overpowering impulse, and
I have more than once taken advantage of it.
In the case of the Darlington substitution scandal it was of use to me, and also in the Arnsworth Castle business.
A married woman grabs at her baby; an unmarried one reaches for her jewel-box.
Now it was clear to me that our lady of to- day had nothing in the house more precious to her than what we are in quest of.
She would rush to secure it.
The alarm of fire was admirably done.
The smoke and shouting were enough to shake nerves of steel.
She responded beautifully.
The photograph is in a recess behind a sliding panel just above the right bell- pull.
She was there in an instant, and I caught a glimpse of it as she half-drew it out.
When I cried out that it was a false alarm, she replaced it, glanced at the rocket, rushed from the room, and I have not seen her since.
I rose, and, making my excuses, escaped from the house.
I hesitated whether to attempt to secure the photograph at once; but the coachman had come in, and as he was watching me narrowly it seemed safer to wait.
A little over-precipitance may ruin all."
"And now?"
I asked.
"Our quest is practically finished. I shall call with the King to-morrow, and with you, if you care to come with us.
We will be shown into the sitting-room to wait for the lady, but it is probable that when she comes she may find neither us nor the photograph.
It might be a satisfaction to his Majesty to regain it with his own hands."
"And when will you call?"
"At eight in the morning.
She will not be up, so that we shall have a clear field.
Besides, we must be prompt, for this marriage may mean a complete change in her life and habits.
I must wire to the King without delay."
We had reached Baker Street and had stopped at the door.
He was searching his pockets for the key when someone passing said:
"Good-night, Mister Sherlock Holmes."
There were several people on the pavement at the time, but the greeting appeared to come from a slim youth in an ulster who had hurried by.
"I've heard that voice before," said
Holmes, staring down the dimly lit street.
"Now, I wonder who the deuce that could have been."
IIl.
I slept at Baker Street that night, and we were engaged upon our toast and coffee in the morning when the King of Bohemia rushed into the room.
"You have really got it!" he cried, grasping Sherlock Holmes by either shoulder and looking eagerly into his face.
"Not yet."
"But you have hopes?"
"I have hopes."
"Then, come.
I am all impatience to be gone."
"We must have a cab."
"No, my brougham is waiting."
"Then that will simplify matters."
We descended and started off once more for
Briony Lodge.
"Irene Adler is married," remarked Holmes.
"Married!
When?"
"Yesterday."
"But to whom?"
"To an English lawyer named Norton."
"But she could not love him."
"I am in hopes that she does."
"And why in hopes?"
"Because it would spare your Majesty all fear of future annoyance.
If the lady loves her husband, she does not love your Majesty.
If she does not love your Majesty, there is no reason why she should interfere with your Majesty's plan."
"It is true.
And yet--Well! I wish she had been of my own station!
What a queen she would have made!"
He relapsed into a moody silence, which was not broken until we drew up in Serpentine
Avenue.
The door of Briony Lodge was open, and an elderly woman stood upon the steps.
She watched us with a sardonic eye as we stepped from the brougham.
"Mr. Sherlock Holmes, I believe?" said she.
"I am Mr. Holmes," answered my companion, looking at her with a questioning and rather startled gaze.
"Indeed!
My mistress told me that you were likely to call.
She left this morning with her husband by the 5:15 train from Charing Cross for the
Continent."
"What!"
Sherlock Holmes staggered back, white with chagrin and surprise.
"Do you mean that she has left England?"
"Never to return."
"And the papers?" asked the King hoarsely.
"All is lost."
"We shall see."
He pushed past the servant and rushed into the drawing-room, followed by the King and myself. The furniture was scattered about in every direction, with dismantled shelves and open drawers, as if the lady had hurriedly ransacked them before her flight.
Holmes rushed at the bell-pull, tore back a small sliding shutter, and, plunging in his hand, pulled out a photograph and a letter.
The photograph was of Irene Adler herself in evening dress, the letter was superscribed to "Sherlock Holmes, Esq.
To be left till called for."
My friend tore it open and we all three read it together.
It was dated at midnight of the preceding night and ran in this way:
"MY DEAR MR. SHERLOCK HOLMES,--You really did it very well.
You took me in completely.
Until after the alarm of fire, I had not a suspicion.
But then, when I found how I had betrayed myself, I began to think.
I had been warned against you months ago.
I had been told that if the King employed an agent it would certainly be you.
And your address had been given me.
Yet, with all this, you made me reveal what you wanted to know.
Even after I became suspicious, I found it hard to think evil of such a dear, kind old clergyman.
But, you know, I have been trained as an actress myself.
Male costume is nothing new to me.
I often take advantage of the freedom which it gives.
I sent John, the coachman, to watch you, ran up stairs, got into my walking-clothes, as I call them, and came down just as you departed.
"Well, I followed you to your door, and so made sure that I was really an object of interest to the celebrated Mr. Sherlock
Holmes.
Then I, rather imprudently, wished you good-night, and started for the Temple to see my husband.
"We both thought the best resource was flight, when pursued by so formidable an antagonist; so you will find the nest empty when you call to-morrow.
As to the photograph, your client may rest in peace. I love and am loved by a better man than he.
The King may do what he will without hindrance from one whom he has cruelly wronged.
I keep it only to safeguard myself, and to preserve a weapon which will always secure me from any steps which he might take in the future. I leave a photograph which he might care to possess; and I remain, dear Mr. Sherlock
Holmes,
"Very truly yours, "IRENE NORTON, n√©e
ADLER."
"What a woman--oh, what a woman!" cried the
King of Bohemia, when we had all three read this epistle.
"Did I not tell you how quick and resolute she was? Would she not have made an admirable queen?
Is it not a pity that she was not on my level?"
"From what I have seen of the lady she seems indeed to be on a very different level to your Majesty," said Holmes coldly.
"I am sorry that I have not been able to bring your Majesty's business to a more successful conclusion."
"On the contrary, my dear sir," cried the
King; "nothing could be more successful. I know that her word is inviolate. The photograph is now as safe as if it were in the fire."
"I am glad to hear your Majesty say so."
"I am immensely indebted to you.
Pray tell me in what way I can reward you.
This ring--" He slipped an emerald snake ring from his finger and held it out upon the palm of his hand.
"Your Majesty has something which I should value even more highly," said Holmes.
"You have but to name it."
"This photograph!"
The King stared at him in amazement.
"Irene's photograph!" he cried.
"Certainly, if you wish it."
"I thank your Majesty.
Then there is no more to be done in the matter. I have the honour to wish you a very good- morning."
He bowed, and, turning away without observing the hand which the King had stretched out to him, he set off in my company for his chambers.
And that was how a great scandal threatened to affect the kingdom of Bohemia, and how the best plans of Mr. Sherlock Holmes were beaten by a woman's wit.
He used to make merry over the cleverness of women, but I have not heard him do it of late.
And when he speaks of Irene Adler, or when he refers to her photograph, it is always under the honourable title of the woman.

Episode 1
Oh Ha Ni?
Oh Ha Ni?!
Yes?
What are you thinking about so early in the morning?
Children, studying is tough, isn't it?
Yeah...
Is it tough?!
Yes!
I know, what it means to be living as a senior in South Korea.
How lonely and hard it is...
Stop digging through your bag!
Erase those fake eyes!
However, even if you guys complain about how difficult it is...
Could it compare to the stress third year teachers have to endure?!
Do you know the bitter taste of the teaching organization!!
Seems our grades are out, right?
That's right.
We're probably placed last again.
It's not the first time.
I don't understand why she gets so upset every time.
Your house construction is done right?
You're not going to have a house-warming party?
I haven't been able to unpack and organize any of my things.
My dad comes home late every day and so do I.
Have Bong Joon Gu do it for you.
Earlier, he was staring at you like this.
No!!
If it's no, then what else is it?
He even joined the art club because of you.
Don't you ever get tired of it?
What...this?
Hey, if the daughter of a pork hock restaurant gets tired of them, then who else would come and eat it?
Ha Ni, are you tired of eating noodles?
I mean does the daughter of a noodle restaurant get tired of eating noodles?
I don't get tired of my dad's noodles.
Your restaurant's noodles are really tasty!
I approve, I approve!
Agree!
Hi!
Hi!
Heya?
Did she just greet us like that?
Huh?
What is this?
Why isn't it coming out?
Thank you.
Thank you...?
The senior mid-term exams, Baek Seung Jo Oppa got first place again
Is first place a big deal?
A perfect score!
He got 500/500.
What?
Baek Seung Jo got 100% again?
Is he human?
I said he wasn't human.
He's a spirit.
"Spirit of the Forest".
So, I was following this white horse and then...
It disappeared and suddenly it reappeared!
Seriously... How should I say this?
It's the kind of beauty you want to take a bite out of!
Take a bite?!
That's when I realized what a vampire must feel like.
Maybe in the beginning vampires were like that too.
The neck of the girl he loved was so very white and so very beautiful...
He had no choice but to bite her!
Really Ha Ni, just take a bite of this pig foot.
Hey!
I'm not making this up!
Okay, so just eat this.
Bite this, here, here!
Seung Jo oppa...
You can have this, I just bought it.
My mom told me to tell your mom that she says hi.
I'm Jang Mi.
Hong Jang Mi.
My mom and your mom are close.
Oh my!
It's not working again.
Ha Ni sunbae!
It's not coming out!
That sunbae helped me get this.
Ha Ni Sunbae, hurry up!
Here you go, Oppa.
Oppa, you got a perfect score this time too, right?
Wow! You're the best!
Ha Ni!
Oh Ha Ni!
Oh Ha Ni!!
OH!
HA!
Nl!
That's why you should just confess.
Confess?
We're going to be graduating soon.
How long are you going to be like this?
Oh! It's because I haven't confessed.
Since he doesn't know how I feel, that's why he can't express himself towards me.
Because he's shy.
What are you looking up?
I'm looking up the word "shy".
Alright, I got it.
I'll confess in a wonderful way.
But, how should I do it?
I want it to be very impressive.
How about this?
"My precious Seung Jo, I love you."
Oh...that's not bad!
Not bad!? What the heck!
What are you looking up?
I'm looking up the words "not bad."
Don't you have any good ideas?
You read a lot of books.
When animals confess, they dance.
Dance?
Fish, birds, and penguins, too, and even drosophila.
They all the dance...the "Courtship Dance."
Courtship dance?
Aish.
Oh my!
We meet again.
Yep.
We're examining a real life model today, right?
As a senior, shouldn't you be studying?
Yeah!
We don't do stuff like studying.
Is your throat okay?
It seemed like your throat was going to rip back there.
Hey!
Don't.
However, won't it be hard?
Um?
What is?
Nothing.
Oh.
Seung Jo... ...likes girls with big breasts too?
Of course.
Isn't Seung Jo Oppa a man too?
But why is Joon Gu Oppa not here yet?
He knows he is going to model for us today, right? &lt;i&gt;Brought to you by the PKer team @ www.viikii.net&lt;/i&gt;
What's that?
What what what's that?
Move it!
What's this?
It's a chiacken.
Chiacken?
What's chiacken?
Chicken, a chicken.
Oh!
It's Samgyetang! (Korean chicken soup)
This is Samgye...
This is for you.
Why are you giving it to me?
Look at you!
You are so thin.
Joon Gu Oppa!
Hurry up and get ready, we don't have time to waste.
Alright, alright!
You eat it all!
Lower your waist a little bit more.
And arm higher...
Raise your leg a little.
Huh?
A little bit more...
Like this?
No, a little bit more.
This?!
Stop!
Okay, today's concept is capturing movement.
Okay then...
Let's start. &lt;i&gt;Ahh my joints are in pain! &lt;i&gt;I feel like I'm gonna die, &lt;i&gt;but look!
Ha Ni is looking at me right now. &lt;i&gt;Ha Ni is drawing me. &lt;i&gt;This kind of pain &lt;i&gt;is nothing! &lt;i&gt;doesn't know how to give up! [Confess... Courtship dance...
What kind of bastard...
Goodness...
Can you still laugh when looking at this, Ms. Song Gang Yi?
Mr. Song Ji Ho's class has a lot of white stickers over here...
And where there are a lot of blue stickers... ...represents your students, Ms. Song Gang Yi.
It's so very blue, isn't it?!
You're right.
It's like an ocean.
Teacher Song!!
Yes?
Ah...not Mr. Song, but Ms. Song. (same family name)
Teacher Song Gang Yi, your class is bringing
These kids right here!
Oh Ha Ni, Dok Go Mi Na, Jung Ju Ri, and Bong Jun Gu!
Do something with at least these four rascals.
Might as well not allow them to take the test!
They are such an embarrassment!
Embarrassment!
That such an intelligent student like Baek Seung Jo was able to attend our school...
I am truly grateful.
Now, for the finishing touches.
You know that if you add some details to the muscles it will look more realistic, right?
Joon Gu Oppa, you can come down now.
Oh, okay.
Ouch!
Ahhh!
My leg, my leg!
I feel like I'm going to die.
Oh, right there!
That's good, good!
Ha Ni Sunbae!
Yes?
Why?
What?
What's going on?
Huh?!
What's this?
Do I look like this?
[So Pal Bok Guksoo] (Korean noodles)
Ha Ni!
Check!
Oh, okay.
Check, please.
Yes.
We can let them dry all night and take them down tomorrow.
I just can't tell.
I've seen you do this since I was a baby.
Ah, when you were little, the roof was open. But nowadays people don't like it aired outside, because the air is bad.
When I was a baby, we used to air it outside.
Right?
Huh?
Did you just say that?
Dad?
I guess so...
Dad...
Yes?
Dad, how did you show your love to Mom?
Show my love?
I mean confess!
Huh??
I mean... Dad, you know my friend Ju Ri, right?
Yes.
Well, she's come to like someone, and she's wondering how to confess to him. You see, back then my car was a complete piece of crap! I took your mom in that car... ...and we sped all around the city!
Your mom asked, "are you crazy?"
She screamed, telling me to let her out.
And then?
So as I drove that car, I yelled right back at her.
"Do you want to kiss me or do you want to date me?"
"Do you want to date me or do you want to live with me?"
"Want to live with me?"
"Or do you want to just die with me?!"
And then...
She said she was going to live with you?
No.
She asked, "do you wanna die?"
"Don't joke around."
What is this?
Ha Ni, but she later told me,
Really?
Hey Baek Seung Jo.
Do you want to kiss me or do you want to date me?

Bam!
You want to be buried?
Surely...when you're confessing... a thought out letter works best.
Letter?
Yeah.
Something like a love letter.
Dad!
See you at home later!
Unnie!
Good work!
Ha Ni! Clean your room!
Oh... no...
I'm sorry.
It's okay.
Aigoo.
Did she find a crush? &lt;i&gt;I want to marry you, accept my heart.&lt;i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Playful Kiss~
[Baek Seung Jo]
Still no reply?
You wrote your name?
Yeah.
And your phone number?
Yeah.
But I don't think he will call.
Well, you never know. There's always texting.
Maybe he didn't see it yet.
Oh!
He's coming this way!
What do I do?
Did he see you?
He might be here for you.
Maybe he didn't read the letter?
Maybe he didn't see Ha Ni?
Right?
Ha Ni!!!
Oh Ha Ni!
Oh Ha Ni!
OH HA Nl!!!
Oh Ha...
What should I do?
Ha Ni!!!
Oh Ha Ni!!!
Oh... Ha...
He's just leaving?
Ha Ni!
Oh Ha Ni!
OH HA Nl!
Leave it. Stop.
Oh Ha Ni?
Are you Oh Ha Ni?
He's coming, he's coming, he's coming!
Ah Oppa!
Where is he?
Where is he?
I wasn't expecting a reply.
Thanks.
Should I read it now?
Right here?
Hey, Hong Jang Mi.
Is this a love letter to Seung Jo oppa?
- Aren't you going to stop that?!
- But what is this?!
Oh my!
He fixed her grammar mistakes!
It's not a love letter. It's an exam paper!
An exam!
Score D-!
"Truthfully, I don't call you Seung Jo."
"I call you the 'Spirit of the Forest.'"
Oh my God, she called him a Spirit of the Forest!
- "If you ask why..." - What the hell are you doing?!
I shouldn't really have gone to such an extent... but...
But?
But what?
I absolutely hate stupid girls.
Where are you going!?!

Hey hey hey!!!
Do you only see mistakes in this?
You should be looking at the substance of it, not the words.
The feelings she put into it!
Ah, you punk, you're going to keep on doing that, huh?
Let's do this.
Don't just stand there, come at me!
Did you see that?
What?
Scared?
Are you scared!?
- Hey, come. Come! Bring it!
Come? Come for what?!
Bong Joon Gu, you! Come into my office right now!
- But Vice Principal, that isn't it.
Please listen to me.
- Listen.
Listen to what?
Seung Jo, don't worry about this.
Go and study.
Don't hang around with this fool.
The top 4% is in red.
Orange is the top 11%.
Yellow has been the same for four years.
Green is just there to make the other students look better.
You guys are violet.
You are the embarrassment of the school.
That's what the Vice Principal said.
There are 50 spots for study hall this month.
They're just numbers.
But I'm sure you realize that those numbers signify the highest ranked students, right?
I don't know how you can sit there laughing, writing such useless things when that list is right here.
Are you stupid or just thick skinned?
Regretably, I despise girls that are stupid whether or not they're thick skinned... ...they disgust me. &lt;i&gt;[Baek Seung Jo]&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;[Oh Ha Ni]&lt;/i&gt;
Stop running!
Will you stop running already?!
Hey, what are you doing?
You're already on your 34th lap.
Two more.
Two more laps.
What is this?
Is she training for a marathon or something?
Why is she running so much?
Let her be.
Ha Ni likes running.
I suppose. If you could go to university by running long distances, Oh Ha Ni would be in the lead.
You're right. My specialty is doing anything... for a long period of time.
Even if I have to crawl, I'll get there.
Me too.
Let's go!
Last lap, let's go!
It's her, it's her!
The one who confessed to Baek Seung Jo and got rejected!
I heard she was humiliated and she wasn't even pretty. &lt;i&gt; I don't understand women like her... &lt;i&gt;I know!
Seung Jo Oppa is ours though.
- Hey, Oh Ha Ni, Oh Ha Ni...
- What?! Oh Ha Ni. What?
Auntie, it's too much.
You have to eat a lot to gain strength. How else are you going to live?
Still she's very optimistic. If it were me, I don't think I would be able to come to school.
You say so? She's a senior yet she still doesn't know how to write Korean. Aigoo, how frustrating.
Ha Ni! The two story house is really nice!!
Where did the scissors go?
Ummm... should be...
It's here.
Ha Ni!
Do you know how old this table is?
Grandma gave it to you when you opened the noodle shop; it's older than me.
That's right! The table is 21 years old!
There's not even a scratch! It's really sturdy! When you were little...you played in here...
Jjan~!
(Surprise!)
Ha Ni. It's a two story house.
You sang a song about two story houses, so how do you like it?
I like it.
What's going on?
You didn't do well?
What do you mean?
Aah... that... let...
Nothing.
Aigooo~
This was here!
Here, look at this!
It's super cute right?
You were this small when you were a year old. You've grown up so much. But you are like this, rebellious now!
I am not!
My hand is similar to Mom's hand.
Right?
Huh?
Yes.
Dad.
Ha Ni~
We're here!
I'm here too!
Hurry up! I'm so hungry that I might die!
Wow, it's to die for!
Wow!
This is just great!
Wow, is this your room?
It's so close! Right?! Right?!
Where? Where?
Where?
Where? Where?
Wow, this is great!
It's so great here.
Ha Ni, your house is awesome! Two story house!
For me, I like this the best!
Ha Ni! Is this your foot?
Yes.
It's so cute.
Hey!!
Stop that! Bong Joon Gu!
- Why?
- Come on, kids!
Ha Ni, get that.
- Yes. - I will get that.
I will get it.
It smells great!
Wow, it looks so good.
There wasn't much time so I didn't prepare much food.
When did you prepare all this? This is a lot!
This is a feast!
Is that right?
We're having guests from Busan today so the main menu is Busan's Mil-myun (Busan's local noodles).
How did you know? It's my favorite.
Wah.
Thank you, dad!
- I'll eat well!
- I'll eat well!!
Father!
Hmm? It's to die for. To die for?
The noodles are soft yet so chewy!
It seems like you know something.
Yes, Father. You can't tell, but my tongue is very sensitive.
At last year's festival, Joon Gu made and sold Dduk Bok Gi. It was really good.
He's different than he looks.
Well, appearance-wise your face looks like a bear's feet...
Beer feet?
What?
You didn't know?
Eat up...
But why is the store named So Pal Bok Noodles? Ha Ni's grandma is So Pal Bok, so that's why we used it.
You mean you carried on the family business? That's right!
My mother-in-law for 40 years and me for 20 years.
Ohhhh~
No wonder. A deep taste like this can't come from an amateur.
True! I learned while being hit.
I wish my Ha Ni could carry on this business.
She doesn't seem to have the talent for cooking though.
Don't worry, Father! Ha Ni and I... will together...do our very best!
Hey! What's wrong with you?
What?
A store that's been around for more than 60 years can't end just like that, right?
Yeah, but it's not a bad idea to donate everything back to society either.
Father!
Now I see you're the kind of person who spits with a smile on your face.
Ha Ni!
Oh, Ha Ni!
What's this?
Hey, Bong Joon Gu, why are you trying to destroy someone else's home?
What are you on about?!
This house is very stable.
What is this?!
Isn't it an earthquake?
Earthquake?
Dad, what are we gonna do?!
It's okay. This is a new house. It's stable...
Ha Ni!
Get out!
Father!
Quickly!
Hurry hurry come on!
Ha Ni, are you alright?
Wait a minute!
Is everyone alright!?
Yes!
How could this happen!?
Oh my!
That's right!
That... that...
That!
What?
That... that...just wait!
Dad! No, you can't!
Don't!
I'll be back quickly!
Don't worry!
Dad...
Da... Dad!
At 5:30 this afternoon, there was a mild earthquake of 2.0 magnitude in Seoul.
It was a tremor that slightly shook windows, however... one house in this area, Yeonhee-dong, has collapsed, as you can see, to the point that it's unrecognizable.
He's still in there!
My dad is still in there... &lt;i&gt;As far as we know there is still a person trapped within the collapsed house. &lt;i&gt;The 2.0 magnitude YeonHee-dong earthquake collapse site.
The rescue team is... &lt;i&gt;...now in the process of clearing a path and rescuing the person. &lt;i&gt;Yes, I believe they're looking to see if anyone is there!!&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Yes!
We can see someone's coming out from under a table in the living room!
Dad!
Dad!
What do you think this is, Dad!?
Aigoo, I lived!
- I'm alive! I'm alive!
- Daddy! &lt;i&gt;Of course, there doesn't seem to be any fatal injuries. &lt;i&gt;The police suspect the collapse was caused by poor construction and are investigating the exact cause.&lt;/i&gt;
Huh!?
Oh Gi Dong? -&lt;i&gt; Thank you.
- Goodbye.
Aigoo!
Here... Huh?
What is this?
Was our house the only one... ...that collapsed?
Oh, really?
Hehe... let's go.
It's her, her, her. Gee... What!
But, are you staying at a hotel again today?
- Yeah. - That must be really expensive.
No, for now we decided to stay at my dad's friend's house.
At least until the house is rebuilt or we find another one.
We were contacted because of the newscast.
Oh really?
That's really great!
Oh, is it her?
What!?
What the heck?
Even pictures now...
You're a total celebrity now.
I'm sorry.
Because of this unlucky friend, you guys are suffering a lot.
Let's go. &lt;i&gt;Please show your power of love.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Thank you for your help.
What are they doing?
Of course you guys know about what happened on the news...
Our friend, Oh Ha Ni, lost her house overnight due to a sudden earthquake. &lt;i&gt;Let's all help Ha Ni.
What the heck is that?
What is Bong Joon Gu doing?
"Love's Fundraising?"
That idiot!
Hey, let's just go this way.
Come on, follow me. &lt;i&gt;Oh!
Thank you. &lt;i&gt;Thank you, let's help Ha Ni.
We're all friends aren't we?
Show us the power of love! Thank you!
Oh, Ha Ni, Oh Ha Ni!
Ha Ni, Ha Ni, move it, move it, move it!
Hey, everyone, everyone, everyone!
Please greet her with thunderous applause.
Even after going through such a horrible experience yesterday, she came to school all determined and ready!
Here is Oh Ha Ni!
Applause!
Ha Ni, Ha Ni!
What. What, what? &lt;i&gt; Now I'm really screwed.&lt;i&gt;
Hey!
Hey, you!
Show some love, Baek Seung Jo.
Didn't you see the news yesterday?
Don't you have a TV at home?
Whose fault do you think it is that Ha Ni is going through such a difficult time?
Wasn't it because of a mild earthquake of 2.0 magnitude?
Oh...
Right, right...
However... Because of that small earthquake... ...the newly built house collapsed.
What do you think about that?
Are you saying that I caused the earthquake?
Then what?
Who can cause a bigger earthquake than you?
You're capable of causing such a great amount of pain to someone's heart, so capable of causing that.
Alright, all I need to do is give you money?
Right...
Put your wallet away!
Did anyone say they'd take your money?
Even if I were homeless, I would never take your money even if you offered.
Really?
Fine, I'll respect that.
Hey, Baek Seung Jo!
Who made you so mighty that you can ignore people like this?
To you, all the kids here look like idiots, don't they?
You think that acting superior and ignoring everyone makes you look cool, right?
Are you just that much better?
Why?
Because your IQ is higher?
Because you're good at studying, you have a handsome face, and you're tall...
Is everything just dandy if you're better than others?
Hey!
We can all study and be smart, who can't?
I just don't study, that's why my grades aren't great. Do you think that my grades are bad because I can't study?
Really?
Yeah!
Then show me.
What?
Show you?
Ok fine, I'll show you.
During the next examining period.
How much?
How much? &lt;i&gt;There are 50 spots for study hall this month.&lt;i&gt; &lt;i&gt; I don't know how you can sit there laughing, writing such useless things. &lt;i&gt; &lt;i&gt; Don't you have any brains? &lt;i&gt; Or just thick skinned?
Right!
The study hall.
Study hall?
This month's study hall?
Yeah!
That high and mighty Special Study Hall.
Next month, I will get in there.
Are you making fun of me again?
If I do it?
And if I do it?
What will you do if I do it?
If you do it?
Yeah!
If you do it, I'll carry you on my back and walk around the school. &lt;i&gt;You'll give me a piggyback ride? &lt;i&gt;No, that's not it!
Fine.
You better look forward to it.
Are you really that close?
Ah!
Of course!
From the day we were born until we finished junior high, we lived together like one family.
Then we moved up to Seoul and we lost touch.
Even when I'm asleep, I feel like bursting with anger because of our house was destroyed.
However, thanks to that... ...finding my friend again is really nice.
Oh why this thing!?
This thing!
Daddy is like an idiot right?
Thanks. &lt;i&gt; Every day with you, &lt;i&gt; Being held in the night's arms. &lt;i&gt; Every day with you, &lt;i&gt; I'm hungry to fall asleep.
Stop!
It's here. House number 142, right?
Oh, you're right.
Just wait here.
Baek Su Chang, it's right.
He must be really rich, your friend.
Yeah... It seems like it. &lt;i&gt;Who is it?
I... Hello.
I'm Su Chang's friend, Oh Gi Dong. &lt;i&gt;Oh yes, come on in! &lt;i&gt;Honey! &lt;i&gt;- You've arrived!?&lt;/i&gt; - Yes.
Come on over here, hurry!
Baek(white) Piggy!
How did you!
Aigoo.
You must have suffered a lot.
Aigoo!
It's really great to see you!
Wow!
- Ah my wife.
-Hi there!
Oh my, welcome to our home.
Yes... I really am here.
It's really great that you're here.
You're completely welcome here!
Hi there.
Hello.
Oh, you must be Gi Dong's daughter.
Yes.
You're more beautiful in person.
Excuse me?
Oh... In all honesty...
I couldn't wait until tonight.
I just stopped by in the morning.
Oh that...
That was me.
Well... We should unload all your stuff.
No, no, we don't have much stuff. Our Ha Ni can do it all by herself.
Yeah!
There isn't much.
Oh, don't worry, our child needs to help.
No, I said it's alright.
Son!
Come here and use your muscles!
Dad, here, here.
I'll do it
Aigoo, just go close the door.
Alright.
Teddy~ From now on, I think our luck will be good.
Don't you think?
Let's go.
Should I help you?
No, it's alright. &lt;i&gt; Is this a dream?
You...you! &lt;i&gt;Brought to you by the PKer team @ www.viikii.net&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;I can't believe it...
It's Seung Jo.
Excuse me!?
Hey!
Give me that!
I have a proposition.
Hey, Oh Ha Ni, what is "x" here?
Alphabet.
I feel like I'm going to explode. You as a child~
Hey!
Hello~
Camera!
Don't spread rumors.
I... I closed my feelings for you.
My feelings for you...aren't even this much.
Really?
CHAPTER 12 Brute Neighbors
Sometimes I had a companion in my fishing, who came through the village to my house from the other side of the town, and the catching of the dinner was as much a social exercise as the eating of it.
Hermit.
I wonder what the world is doing now.
I have not heard so much as a locust over the sweet-fern these three hours.
The pigeons are all asleep upon their roosts--no flutter from them.
Was that a farmer's noon horn which sounded from beyond the woods just now?
The hands are coming in to boiled salt beef and cider and Indian bread.
Why will men worry themselves so?
He that does not eat need not work.
I wonder how much they have reaped.
Who would live there where a body can never think for the barking of Bose?
And oh, the housekeeping! to keep bright the devil's door-knobs, and scour his tubs this bright day!
Better not keep a house.
Say, some hollow tree; and then for morning calls and dinner-parties!
Only a woodpecker tapping.
Oh, they swarm; the sun is too warm there; they are born too far into life for me.
I have water from the spring, and a loaf of brown bread on the shelf.--Hark!
I hear a rustling of the leaves.
Is it some ill-fed village hound yielding to the instinct of the chase? or the lost pig which is said to be in these woods, whose tracks I saw after the rain?
It comes on apace; my sumachs and sweetbriers tremble.--Eh, Mr. Poet, is it you?
How do you like the world to-day?
Poet.
See those clouds; how they hang!
That's the greatest thing I have seen to- day.
There's nothing like it in old paintings, nothing like it in foreign lands--unless when we were off the coast of Spain.
That's a true Mediterranean sky.
I thought, as I have my living to get, and have not eaten to-day, that I might go a- fishing.
That's the true industry for poets.
It is the only trade I have learned.
Come, let's along.
Hermit.
I cannot resist.
My brown bread will soon be gone.
I will go with you gladly soon, but I am just concluding a serious meditation.
I think that I am near the end of it.
Leave me alone, then, for a while.
But that we may not be delayed, you shall be digging the bait meanwhile.
Angleworms are rarely to be met with in these parts, where the soil was never fattened with manure; the race is nearly extinct.
The sport of digging the bait is nearly equal to that of catching the fish, when one's appetite is not too keen; and this you may have all to yourself today.
I would advise you to set in the spade down yonder among the ground-nuts, where you see the johnswort waving.
I think that I may warrant you one worm to every three sods you turn up, if you look well in among the roots of the grass, as if you were weeding.
Or, if you choose to go farther, it will not be unwise, for I have found the increase of fair bait to be very nearly as the squares of the distances.
Hermit alone.
Let me see; where was I?
Methinks I was nearly in this frame of mind; the world lay about at this angle.
Shall I go to heaven or a-fishing?
If I should soon bring this meditation to an end, would another so sweet occasion be likely to offer?
I was as near being resolved into the essence of things as ever I was in my life.
I fear my thoughts will not come back to me.
If it would do any good, I would whistle for them.
When they make us an offer, is it wise to say, We will think of it?
My thoughts have left no track, and I cannot find the path again.
What was it that I was thinking of?
It was a very hazy day.
I will just try these three sentences of
Confut-see; they may fetch that state about again.
There never is but one opportunity of a kind.
Mem.
Poet.
How now, Hermit, is it too soon?
I have got just thirteen whole ones, beside several which are imperfect or undersized; but they will do for the smaller fry; they do not cover up the hook so much.
Those village worms are quite too large; a shiner may make a meal off one without finding the skewer.
Hermit.
Well, then, let's be off.
There's good sport there if the water be not too high.
Why do precisely these objects which we behold make a world?
Why has man just these species of animals for his neighbors; as if nothing but a mouse could have filled this crevice?
I suspect that Pilpay &amp; Co. have put animals to their best use, for they are all beasts of burden, in a sense, made to carry some portion of our thoughts.
The mice which haunted my house were not the common ones, which are said to have been introduced into the country, but a wild native kind not found in the village.
I sent one to a distinguished naturalist, and it interested him much.
When I was building, one of these had its nest underneath the house, and before I had laid the second floor, and swept out the shavings, would come out regularly at lunch time and pick up the crumbs at my feet.
It probably had never seen a man before; and it soon became quite familiar, and would run over my shoes and up my clothes.
It could readily ascend the sides of the room by short impulses, like a squirrel, which it resembled in its motions.
At length, as I leaned with my elbow on the bench one day, it ran up my clothes, and along my sleeve, and round and round the paper which held my dinner, while I kept the latter close, and dodged and played at bopeep with it; and when at last I held still a piece of cheese between my thumb and finger, it came and nibbled it, sitting in my hand, and afterward cleaned its face and paws, like a fly, and walked away.
A phoebe soon built in my shed, and a robin for protection in a pine which grew against the house.
In June the partridge (Tetrao umbellus), which is so shy a bird, led her brood past my windows, from the woods in the rear to the front of my house, clucking and calling to them like a hen, and in all her behavior proving herself the hen of the woods.
The young suddenly disperse on your approach, at a signal from the mother, as if a whirlwind had swept them away, and they so exactly resemble the dried leaves and twigs that many a traveler has placed his foot in the midst of a brood, and heard the whir of the old bird as she flew off, and her anxious calls and mewing, or seen her trail her wings to attract his attention, without suspecting their neighborhood.
The parent will sometimes roll and spin round before you in such a dishabille, that you cannot, for a few moments, detect what kind of creature it is.
The young squat still and flat, often running their heads under a leaf, and mind only their mother's directions given from a distance, nor will your approach make them run again and betray themselves.
You may even tread on them, or have your eyes on them for a minute, without discovering them.
I have held them in my open hand at such a time, and still their only care, obedient to their mother and their instinct, was to squat there without fear or trembling.
So perfect is this instinct, that once, when I had laid them on the leaves again, and one accidentally fell on its side, it was found with the rest in exactly the same position ten minutes afterward.
They are not callow like the young of most birds, but more perfectly developed and precocious even than chickens.
The remarkably adult yet innocent expression of their open and serene eyes is very memorable.
All intelligence seems reflected in them.
They suggest not merely the purity of infancy, but a wisdom clarified by experience.
Such an eye was not born when the bird was, but is coeval with the sky it reflects.
The traveller does not often look into such a limpid well.
The ignorant or reckless sportsman often shoots the parent at such a time, and leaves these innocents to fall a prey to some prowling beast or bird, or gradually mingle with the decaying leaves which they so much resemble.
It is said that when hatched by a hen they will directly disperse on some alarm, and so are lost, for they never hear the mother's call which gathers them again.
These were my hens and chickens.
It is remarkable how many creatures live wild and free though secret in the woods, and still sustain themselves in the neighborhood of towns, suspected by hunters only.
How retired the otter manages to live here!
He grows to be four feet long, as big as a small boy, perhaps without any human being getting a glimpse of him.
I formerly saw the raccoon in the woods behind where my house is built, and probably still heard their whinnering at night.
Commonly I rested an hour or two in the shade at noon, after planting, and ate my lunch, and read a little by a spring which was the source of a swamp and of a brook, oozing from under Brister's Hill, half a mile from my field.
The approach to this was through a succession of descending grassy hollows, full of young pitch pines, into a larger wood about the swamp.
There, in a very secluded and shaded spot, under a spreading white pine, there was yet a clean, firm sward to sit on.
I had dug out the spring and made a well of clear gray water, where I could dip up a pailful without roiling it, and thither I went for this purpose almost every day in midsummer, when the pond was warmest.
Thither, too, the woodcock led her brood, to probe the mud for worms, flying but a foot above them down the bank, while they ran in a troop beneath; but at last, spying me, she would leave her young and circle round and round me, nearer and nearer till within four or five feet, pretending broken wings and legs, to attract my attention, and get off her young, who would already have taken up their march, with faint, wiry peep, single file through the swamp, as she directed.
Or I heard the peep of the young when I could not see the parent bird.
There too the turtle doves sat over the spring, or fluttered from bough to bough of the soft white pines over my head; or the red squirrel, coursing down the nearest bough, was particularly familiar and inquisitive.
You only need sit still long enough in some attractive spot in the woods that all its inhabitants may exhibit themselves to you by turns.
I was witness to events of a less peaceful character.
One day when I went out to my wood-pile, or rather my pile of stumps, I observed two large ants, the one red, the other much larger, nearly half an inch long, and black, fiercely contending with one another.
Having once got hold they never let go, but struggled and wrestled and rolled on the chips incessantly.
Looking farther, I was surprised to find that the chips were covered with such combatants, that it was not a duellum, but a bellum, a war between two races of ants, the red always pitted against the black, and frequently two red ones to one black.
The legions of these Myrmidons covered all the hills and vales in my wood-yard, and the ground was already strewn with the dead and dying, both red and black.
It was the only battle which I have ever witnessed, the only battle-field I ever trod while the battle was raging; internecine war; the red republicans on the one hand, and the black imperialists on the other.
On every side they were engaged in deadly combat, yet without any noise that I could hear, and human soldiers never fought so resolutely.
I watched a couple that were fast locked in each other's embraces, in a little sunny valley amid the chips, now at noonday prepared to fight till the sun went down, or life went out.
The smaller red champion had fastened himself like a vice to his adversary's front, and through all the tumblings on that field never for an instant ceased to gnaw at one of his feelers near the root, having already caused the other to go by the board; while the stronger black one dashed him from side to side, and, as I saw on looking nearer, had already divested him of several of his members.
They fought with more pertinacity than bulldogs.
Neither manifested the least disposition to retreat.
It was evident that their battle-cry was "Conquer or die."
In the meanwhile there came along a single red ant on the hillside of this valley, evidently full of excitement, who either had despatched his foe, or had not yet taken part in the battle; probably the latter, for he had lost none of his limbs; whose mother had charged him to return with his shield or upon it.
Or perchance he was some Achilles, who had nourished his wrath apart, and had now come to avenge or rescue his Patroclus.
He saw this unequal combat from afar--for the blacks were nearly twice the size of the red--he drew near with rapid pace till he stood on his guard within half an inch of the combatants; then, watching his opportunity, he sprang upon the black warrior, and commenced his operations near the root of his right fore leg, leaving the foe to select among his own members; and so there were three united for life, as if a new kind of attraction had been invented which put all other locks and cements to shame.
I should not have wondered by this time to find that they had their respective musical bands stationed on some eminent chip, and playing their national airs the while, to excite the slow and cheer the dying combatants.
I was myself excited somewhat even as if they had been men.
The more you think of it, the less the difference.
And certainly there is not the fight recorded in Concord history, at least, if in the history of America, that will bear a moment's comparison with this, whether for the numbers engaged in it, or for the patriotism and heroism displayed.
For numbers and for carnage it was an Austerlitz or Dresden.
Concord Fight!
Two killed on the patriots' side, and Luther Blanchard wounded!
Why here every ant was a Buttrick--"Fire! for God's sake fire!"--and thousands shared the fate of Davis and Hosmer.
There was not one hireling there.
I have no doubt that it was a principle they fought for, as much as our ancestors, and not to avoid a three-penny tax on their tea; and the results of this battle will be as important and memorable to those whom it concerns as those of the battle of Bunker Hill, at least.
I took up the chip on which the three I have particularly described were struggling, carried it into my house, and placed it under a tumbler on my window- sill, in order to see the issue.
Holding a microscope to the first-mentioned red ant, I saw that, though he was assiduously gnawing at the near fore leg of his enemy, having severed his remaining feeler, his own breast was all torn away, exposing what vitals he had there to the jaws of the black warrior, whose breastplate was apparently too thick for him to pierce; and the dark carbuncles of the sufferer's eyes shone with ferocity such as war only could excite.
They struggled half an hour longer under the tumbler, and when I looked again the black soldier had severed the heads of his foes from their bodies, and the still living heads were hanging on either side of him like ghastly trophies at his saddle- bow, still apparently as firmly fastened as ever, and he was endeavoring with feeble struggles, being without feelers and with only the remnant of a leg, and I know not how many other wounds, to divest himself of them; which at length, after half an hour more, he accomplished.
I raised the glass, and he went off over the window-sill in that crippled state.
Whether he finally survived that combat, and spent the remainder of his days in some
Hotel des Invalides, I do not know; but I thought that his industry would not be worth much thereafter.
I never learned which party was victorious, nor the cause of the war; but I felt for the rest of that day as if I had had my feelings excited and harrowed by witnessing the struggle, the ferocity and carnage, of a human battle before my door.
Kirby and Spence tell us that the battles of ants have long been celebrated and the date of them recorded, though they say that Huber is the only modern author who appears to have witnessed them.
"Aeneas Sylvius," say they, "after giving a very circumstantial account of one contested with great obstinacy by a great and small species on the trunk of a pear tree," adds that "this action was fought in the pontificate of Eugenius the Fourth, in the presence of Nicholas Pistoriensis, an eminent lawyer, who related the whole history of the battle with the greatest fidelity."
A similar engagement between great and small ants is recorded by Olaus Magnus, in which the small ones, being victorious, are said to have buried the bodies of their own soldiers, but left those of their giant enemies a prey to the birds.
This event happened previous to the expulsion of the tyrant Christiern the
Second from Sweden.
The battle which I witnessed took place in the Presidency of Polk, five years before the passage of Webster's Fugitive-Slave Bill.
Many a village Bose, fit only to course a mud-turtle in a victualling cellar, sported his heavy quarters in the woods, without the knowledge of his master, and ineffectually smelled at old fox burrows and woodchucks' holes; led perchance by some slight cur which nimbly threaded the wood, and might still inspire a natural terror in its denizens;--now far behind his guide, barking like a canine bull toward some small squirrel which had treed itself for scrutiny, then, cantering off, bending the bushes with his weight, imagining that he is on the track of some stray member of the jerbilla family.
Once I was surprised to see a cat walking along the stony shore of the pond, for they rarely wander so far from home.
The surprise was mutual.
Nevertheless the most domestic cat, which has lain on a rug all her days, appears quite at home in the woods, and, by her sly and stealthy behavior, proves herself more native there than the regular inhabitants.
Once, when berrying, I met with a cat with young kittens in the woods, quite wild, and they all, like their mother, had their backs up and were fiercely spitting at me.
A few years before I lived in the woods there was what was called a "winged cat" in one of the farm-houses in Lincoln nearest the pond, Mr. Gilian Baker's.
When I called to see her in June, 1842, she was gone a-hunting in the woods, as was her wont (I am not sure whether it was a male or female, and so use the more common pronoun), but her mistress told me that she came into the neighborhood a little more than a year before, in April, and was finally taken into their house; that she was of a dark brownish-gray color, with a white spot on her throat, and white feet, and had a large bushy tail like a fox; that in the winter the fur grew thick and flatted out along her sides, forming stripes ten or twelve inches long by two and a half wide, and under her chin like a muff, the upper side loose, the under matted like felt, and in the spring these appendages dropped off.
They gave me a pair of her "wings," which I keep still.
There is no appearance of a membrane about them.
Some thought it was part flying squirrel or some other wild animal, which is not impossible, for, according to naturalists, prolific hybrids have been produced by the union of the marten and domestic cat.
This would have been the right kind of cat for me to keep, if I had kept any; for why should not a poet's cat be winged as well as his horse?
In the fall the loon (Colymbus glacialis) came, as usual, to moult and bathe in the pond, making the woods ring with his wild laughter before I had risen.
At rumor of his arrival all the Mill-dam sportsmen are on the alert, in gigs and on foot, two by two and three by three, with patent rifles and conical balls and spy- glasses.
They come rustling through the woods like autumn leaves, at least ten men to one
loon.
Some station themselves on this side of the pond, some on that, for the poor bird cannot be omnipresent; if he dive here he must come up there.
But now the kind October wind rises, rustling the leaves and rippling the surface of the water, so that no loon can be heard or seen, though his foes sweep the pond with spy-glasses, and make the woods resound with their discharges.
The waves generously rise and dash angrily, taking sides with all water-fowl, and our sportsmen must beat a retreat to town and shop and unfinished jobs.
But they were too often successful.
When I went to get a pail of water early in the morning I frequently saw this stately bird sailing out of my cove within a few rods.
If I endeavored to overtake him in a boat, in order to see how he would manoeuvre, he would dive and be completely lost, so that I did not discover him again, sometimes, till the latter part of the day.
But I was more than a match for him on the surface.
He commonly went off in a rain.
As I was paddling along the north shore one very calm October afternoon, for such days especially they settle on to the lakes, like the milkweed down, having looked in vain over the pond for a loon, suddenly one, sailing out from the shore toward the middle a few rods in front of me, set up his wild laugh and betrayed himself.
I pursued with a paddle and he dived, but when he came up I was nearer than before.
He dived again, but I miscalculated the direction he would take, and we were fifty rods apart when he came to the surface this time, for I had helped to widen the interval; and again he laughed long and loud, and with more reason than before.
He manoeuvred so cunningly that I could not get within half a dozen rods of him.
Each time, when he came to the surface, turning his head this way and that, he cooly surveyed the water and the land, and apparently chose his course so that he might come up where there was the widest expanse of water and at the greatest distance from the boat.
It was surprising how quickly he made up his mind and put his resolve into execution.
He led me at once to the widest part of the pond, and could not be driven from it.
While he was thinking one thing in his brain, I was endeavoring to divine his thought in mine.
It was a pretty game, played on the smooth surface of the pond, a man against a loon.
Suddenly your adversary's checker disappears beneath the board, and the problem is to place yours nearest to where his will appear again.
Sometimes he would come up unexpectedly on the opposite side of me, having apparently passed directly under the boat.
So long-winded was he and so unweariable, that when he had swum farthest he would immediately plunge again, nevertheless; and then no wit could divine where in the deep pond, beneath the smooth surface, he might be speeding his way like a fish, for he had time and ability to visit the bottom of the pond in its deepest part.
It is said that loons have been caught in the New York lakes eighty feet beneath the surface, with hooks set for trout--though Walden is deeper than that.
How surprised must the fishes be to see this ungainly visitor from another sphere speeding his way amid their schools!
Yet he appeared to know his course as surely under water as on the surface, and swam much faster there.
Once or twice I saw a ripple where he approached the surface, just put his head out to reconnoitre, and instantly dived again.
I found that it was as well for me to rest on my oars and wait his reappearing as to endeavor to calculate where he would rise; for again and again, when I was straining my eyes over the surface one way, I would suddenly be startled by his unearthly laugh behind me.
But why, after displaying so much cunning, did he invariably betray himself the moment he came up by that loud laugh?
Did not his white breast enough betray him?
He was indeed a silly loon, I thought.
I could commonly hear the splash of the water when he came up, and so also detected him.
But after an hour he seemed as fresh as ever, dived as willingly, and swam yet farther than at first.
It was surprising to see how serenely he sailed off with unruffled breast when he came to the surface, doing all the work with his webbed feet beneath.
His usual note was this demoniac laughter, yet somewhat like that of a water-fowl; but occasionally, when he had balked me most successfully and come up a long way off, he uttered a long-drawn unearthly howl, probably more like that of a wolf than any bird; as when a beast puts his muzzle to the ground and deliberately howls.
This was his looning--perhaps the wildest sound that is ever heard here, making the woods ring far and wide.
I concluded that he laughed in derision of my efforts, confident of his own resources.
Though the sky was by this time overcast, the pond was so smooth that I could see where he broke the surface when I did not hear him.
His white breast, the stillness of the air, and the smoothness of the water were all against him.
At length having come up fifty rods off, he uttered one of those prolonged howls, as if calling on the god of loons to aid him, and immediately there came a wind from the east and rippled the surface, and filled the whole air with misty rain, and I was impressed as if it were the prayer of the
loon answered, and his god was angry with me; and so I left him disappearing far away on the tumultuous surface.
For hours, in fall days, I watched the ducks cunningly tack and veer and hold the middle of the pond, far from the sportsman; tricks which they will have less need to practise in Louisiana bayous.
When compelled to rise they would sometimes circle round and round and over the pond at a considerable height, from which they could easily see to other ponds and the river, like black motes in the sky; and, when I thought they had gone off thither long since, they would settle down by a slanting flight of a quarter of a mile on to a distant part which was left free; but what beside safety they got by sailing in the middle of Walden I do not know, unless they love its water for the same reason that I do. &gt;
CHAPTER 13 House-Warming
In October I went a-graping to the river meadows, and loaded myself with clusters more precious for their beauty and fragrance than for food.
There, too, I admired, though I did not gather, the cranberries, small waxen gems, pendants of the meadow grass, pearly and red, which the farmer plucks with an ugly rake, leaving the smooth meadow in a snarl, heedlessly measuring them by the bushel and the dollar only, and sells the spoils of the meads to Boston and New York; destined to be jammed, to satisfy the tastes of
lovers of Nature there.
So butchers rake the tongues of bison out of the prairie grass, regardless of the torn and drooping plant.
The barberry's brilliant fruit was likewise food for my eyes merely; but I collected a small store of wild apples for coddling, which the proprietor and travellers had overlooked.
When chestnuts were ripe I laid up half a bushel for winter.
It was very exciting at that season to roam the then boundless chestnut woods of
Lincoln--they now sleep their long sleep under the railroad--with a bag on my shoulder, and a stick to open burs with in my hand, for I did not always wait for the frost, amid the rustling of leaves and the loud reproofs of the red squirrels and the jays, whose half-consumed nuts I sometimes stole, for the burs which they had selected were sure to contain sound ones.
Occasionally I climbed and shook the trees.
They grew also behind my house, and one large tree, which almost overshadowed it, was, when in flower, a bouquet which scented the whole neighborhood, but the squirrels and the jays got most of its fruit; the last coming in flocks early in the morning and picking the nuts out of the burs before they fell, I relinquished these trees to them and visited the more distant woods composed wholly of chestnut.
These nuts, as far as they went, were a good substitute for bread.
Many other substitutes might, perhaps, be found.
Digging one day for fishworms, I discovered the ground-nut (Apios tuberosa) on its string, the potato of the aborigines, a sort of fabulous fruit, which I had begun to doubt if I had ever dug and eaten in childhood, as I had told, and had not dreamed it.
I had often since seen its crumpled red velvety blossom supported by the stems of other plants without knowing it to be the same.
Cultivation has well-nigh exterminated it.
It has a sweetish taste, much like that of a frost-bitten potato, and I found it better boiled than roasted.
This tuber seemed like a faint promise of Nature to rear her own children and feed them simply here at some future period.
In these days of fatted cattle and waving grain-fields this humble root, which was once the totem of an Indian tribe, is quite forgotten, or known only by its flowering vine; but let wild Nature reign here once more, and the tender and luxurious English grains will probably disappear before a myriad of foes, and without the care of man the crow may carry back even the last seed of corn to the great cornfield of the
Indian's God in the southwest, whence he is said to have brought it; but the now almost exterminated ground-nut will perhaps revive and flourish in spite of frosts and wildness, prove itself indigenous, and resume its ancient importance and dignity as the diet of the hunter tribe.
Some Indian Ceres or Minerva must have been the inventor and bestower of it; and when the reign of poetry commences here, its leaves and string of nuts may be represented on our works of art.
Already, by the first of September, I had seen two or three small maples turned scarlet across the pond, beneath where the white stems of three aspens diverged, at the point of a promontory, next the water.
Ah, many a tale their color told!
And gradually from week to week the character of each tree came out, and it admired itself reflected in the smooth mirror of the lake.
Each morning the manager of this gallery substituted some new picture, distinguished by more brilliant or harmonious coloring, for the old upon the walls.
The wasps came by thousands to my lodge in October, as to winter quarters, and settled on my windows within and on the walls overhead, sometimes deterring visitors from entering.
Each morning, when they were numbed with cold, I swept some of them out, but I did not trouble myself much to get rid of them; I even felt complimented by their regarding my house as a desirable shelter.
They never molested me seriously, though they bedded with me; and they gradually disappeared, into what crevices I do not know, avoiding winter and unspeakable cold.
Like the wasps, before I finally went into winter quarters in November, I used to resort to the northeast side of Walden, which the sun, reflected from the pitch pine woods and the stony shore, made the fireside of the pond; it is so much pleasanter and wholesomer to be warmed by the sun while you can be, than by an artificial fire.
I thus warmed myself by the still glowing embers which the summer, like a departed hunter, had left.
When I came to build my chimney I studied masonry.
My bricks, being second-hand ones, required to be cleaned with a trowel, so that I learned more than usual of the qualities of bricks and trowels.
The mortar on them was fifty years old, and was said to be still growing harder; but this is one of those sayings which men love to repeat whether they are true or not.
Such sayings themselves grow harder and adhere more firmly with age, and it would take many blows with a trowel to clean an old wiseacre of them.
Many of the villages of Mesopotamia are built of second-hand bricks of a very good quality, obtained from the ruins of Babylon, and the cement on them is older and probably harder still.
However that may be, I was struck by the peculiar toughness of the steel which bore so many violent blows without being worn out.
As my bricks had been in a chimney before, though I did not read the name of
Nebuchadnezzar on them, I picked out as many fireplace bricks as I could find, to save work and waste, and I filled the spaces between the bricks about the fireplace with stones from the pond shore, and also made my mortar with the white sand from the same place.
I lingered most about the fireplace, as the most vital part of the house.
Indeed, I worked so deliberately, that though I commenced at the ground in the morning, a course of bricks raised a few inches above the floor served for my pillow at night; yet I did not get a stiff neck for it that I remember; my stiff neck is of older date.
I took a poet to board for a fortnight about those times, which caused me to be put to it for room.
He brought his own knife, though I had two, and we used to scour them by thrusting them into the earth.
He shared with me the labors of cooking.
I was pleased to see my work rising so square and solid by degrees, and reflected, that, if it proceeded slowly, it was calculated to endure a long time.
The chimney is to some extent an independent structure, standing on the ground, and rising through the house to the heavens; even after the house is burned it still stands sometimes, and its importance and independence are apparent.
This was toward the end of summer.
It was now November.
The north wind had already begun to cool the pond, though it took many weeks of steady blowing to accomplish it, it is so deep.
When I began to have a fire at evening, before I plastered my house, the chimney carried smoke particularly well, because of the numerous chinks between the boards.
Yet I passed some cheerful evenings in that cool and airy apartment, surrounded by the rough brown boards full of knots, and rafters with the bark on high overhead.
My house never pleased my eye so much after it was plastered, though I was obliged to confess that it was more comfortable.
Should not every apartment in which man dwells be lofty enough to create some obscurity overhead, where flickering shadows may play at evening about the rafters?
These forms are more agreeable to the fancy and imagination than fresco paintings or other the most expensive furniture.
I now first began to inhabit my house, I may say, when I began to use it for warmth as well as shelter.
I had got a couple of old fire-dogs to keep the wood from the hearth, and it did me good to see the soot form on the back of the chimney which I had built, and I poked the fire with more right and more satisfaction than usual.
My dwelling was small, and I could hardly entertain an echo in it; but it seemed larger for being a single apartment and remote from neighbors.
All the attractions of a house were concentrated in one room; it was kitchen, chamber, parlor, and keeping-room; and whatever satisfaction parent or child, master or servant, derive from living in a house, I enjoyed it all.
Cato says, the master of a family (patremfamilias) must have in his rustic villa "cellam oleariam, vinariam, dolia multa, uti lubeat caritatem expectare, et rei, et virtuti, et gloriae erit," that is,
"an oil and wine cellar, many casks, so that it may be pleasant to expect hard times; it will be for his advantage, and virtue, and glory."
I had in my cellar a firkin of potatoes, about two quarts of peas with the weevil in them, and on my shelf a little rice, a jug of molasses, and of rye and Indian meal a peck each.
I sometimes dream of a larger and more populous house, standing in a golden age, of enduring materials, and without gingerbread work, which shall still consist of only one room, a vast, rude, substantial, primitive hall, without ceiling or plastering, with bare rafters and purlins supporting a sort of lower heaven over one's head--useful to keep off rain and snow, where the king and queen posts stand out to receive your homage, when you have done reverence to the prostrate Saturn of an older dynasty on stepping over the sill; a cavernous house, wherein you must reach up a torch upon a pole to see the roof; where some may live in the fireplace, some in the recess of a window, and some on settles, some at one end of the hall, some at another, and some aloft on rafters with the spiders, if they choose; a house which you have got into when you have opened the outside door, and the ceremony is over; where the weary traveller may wash, and eat, and converse, and sleep, without further journey; such a shelter as you would be glad to reach in a tempestuous night, containing all the essentials of a house, and nothing for house-keeping; where you can see all the treasures of the house at one view, and everything hangs upon its peg, that a man should use; at once kitchen, pantry, parlor, chamber, storehouse, and garret; where you can see so necessary a thing, as a barrel or a ladder, so convenient a thing as a cupboard, and hear the pot boil, and pay your respects to the fire that cooks your dinner, and the oven that bakes your bread, and the necessary furniture and utensils are the chief ornaments; where the washing is not put out, nor the fire, nor the mistress, and perhaps you are sometimes requested to move from off the trap-door, when the cook would descend into the cellar, and so learn whether the ground is solid or hollow beneath you without stamping.
A house whose inside is as open and manifest as a bird's nest, and you cannot go in at the front door and out at the back without seeing some of its inhabitants; where to be a guest is to be presented with the freedom of the house, and not to be carefully excluded from seven eighths of it, shut up in a particular cell, and told to make yourself at home there--in solitary confinement.
Nowadays the host does not admit you to his hearth, but has got the mason to build one for yourself somewhere in his alley, and hospitality is the art of keeping you at the greatest distance.
There is as much secrecy about the cooking as if he had a design to poison you.
I am aware that I have been on many a man's premises, and might have been legally ordered off, but I am not aware that I have been in many men's houses.
I might visit in my old clothes a king and queen who lived simply in such a house as I have described, if I were going their way; but backing out of a modern palace will be all that I shall desire to learn, if ever I am caught in one.
It would seem as if the very language of our parlors would lose all its nerve and degenerate into palaver wholly, our lives pass at such remoteness from its symbols, and its metaphors and tropes are necessarily so far fetched, through slides and dumb-waiters, as it were; in other words, the parlor is so far from the kitchen and workshop.
The dinner even is only the parable of a dinner, commonly.
As if only the savage dwelt near enough to Nature and Truth to borrow a trope from them.
How can the scholar, who dwells away in the North West Territory or the Isle of Man, tell what is parliamentary in the kitchen?
However, only one or two of my guests were ever bold enough to stay and eat a hasty- pudding with me; but when they saw that crisis approaching they beat a hasty retreat rather, as if it would shake the house to its foundations.
Nevertheless, it stood through a great many hasty-puddings.
I did not plaster till it was freezing weather.
I brought over some whiter and cleaner sand for this purpose from the opposite shore of the pond in a boat, a sort of conveyance which would have tempted me to go much farther if necessary.
My house had in the meanwhile been shingled down to the ground on every side.
In lathing I was pleased to be able to send home each nail with a single blow of the hammer, and it was my ambition to transfer the plaster from the board to the wall neatly and rapidly.
I remembered the story of a conceited fellow, who, in fine clothes, was wont to lounge about the village once, giving advice to workmen.
Venturing one day to substitute deeds for words, he turned up his cuffs, seized a plasterer's board, and having loaded his trowel without mishap, with a complacent look toward the lathing overhead, made a bold gesture thitherward; and straightway, to his complete discomfiture, received the whole contents in his ruffled bosom.
I admired anew the economy and convenience of plastering, which so effectually shuts out the cold and takes a handsome finish, and I learned the various casualties to which the plasterer is liable.
I was surprised to see how thirsty the bricks were which drank up all the moisture in my plaster before I had smoothed it, and how many pailfuls of water it takes to christen a new hearth.
I had the previous winter made a small quantity of lime by burning the shells of the Unio fluviatilis, which our river affords, for the sake of the experiment; so that I knew where my materials came from.
I might have got good limestone within a mile or two and burned it myself, if I had cared to do so.
The pond had in the meanwhile skimmed over in the shadiest and shallowest coves, some days or even weeks before the general freezing.
The first ice is especially interesting and perfect, being hard, dark, and transparent, and affords the best opportunity that ever offers for examining the bottom where it is shallow; for you can lie at your length on ice only an inch thick, like a skater insect on the surface of the water, and study the bottom at your leisure, only two or three inches distant, like a picture behind a glass, and the water is necessarily always smooth then.
There are many furrows in the sand where some creature has travelled about and doubled on its tracks; and, for wrecks, it is strewn with the cases of caddis-worms made of minute grains of white quartz.
Perhaps these have creased it, for you find some of their cases in the furrows, though they are deep and broad for them to make.
But the ice itself is the object of most interest, though you must improve the earliest opportunity to study it.
If you examine it closely the morning after it freezes, you find that the greater part of the bubbles, which at first appeared to be within it, are against its under surface, and that more are continually rising from the bottom; while the ice is as yet comparatively solid and dark, that is, you see the water through it.
These bubbles are from an eightieth to an eighth of an inch in diameter, very clear and beautiful, and you see your face reflected in them through the ice.
There may be thirty or forty of them to a square inch.
There are also already within the ice narrow oblong perpendicular bubbles about half an inch long, sharp cones with the apex upward; or oftener, if the ice is quite fresh, minute spherical bubbles one directly above another, like a string of beads.
But these within the ice are not so numerous nor obvious as those beneath.
I sometimes used to cast on stones to try the strength of the ice, and those which broke through carried in air with them, which formed very large and conspicuous white bubbles beneath.
One day when I came to the same place forty-eight hours afterward, I found that those large bubbles were still perfect, though an inch more of ice had formed, as I could see distinctly by the seam in the edge of a cake.
But as the last two days had been very warm, like an Indian summer, the ice was not now transparent, showing the dark green color of the water, and the bottom, but opaque and whitish or gray, and though twice as thick was hardly stronger than before, for the air bubbles had greatly expanded under this heat and run together, and lost their regularity; they were no longer one directly over another, but often like silvery coins poured from a bag, one overlapping another, or in thin flakes, as if occupying slight cleavages.
The beauty of the ice was gone, and it was too late to study the bottom.
Being curious to know what position my great bubbles occupied with regard to the new ice, I broke out a cake containing a middling sized one, and turned it bottom upward.
The new ice had formed around and under the bubble, so that it was included between the two ices.
It was wholly in the lower ice, but close against the upper, and was flattish, or perhaps slightly lenticular, with a rounded edge, a quarter of an inch deep by four inches in diameter; and I was surprised to find that directly under the bubble the ice was melted with great regularity in the form of a saucer reversed, to the height of five eighths of an inch in the middle,
leaving a thin partition there between the water and the bubble, hardly an eighth of an inch thick; and in many places the small bubbles in this partition had burst out downward, and probably there was no ice at all under the largest bubbles, which were a foot in diameter.
I inferred that the infinite number of minute bubbles which I had first seen against the under surface of the ice were now frozen in likewise, and that each, in its degree, had operated like a burning- glass on the ice beneath to melt and rot it.
These are the little air-guns which contribute to make the ice crack and whoop.
At length the winter set in good earnest, just as I had finished plastering, and the wind began to howl around the house as if it had not had permission to do so till then.
Night after night the geese came lumbering in the dark with a clangor and a whistling of wings, even after the ground was covered with snow, some to alight in Walden, and some flying low over the woods toward Fair Haven, bound for Mexico.
Several times, when returning from the village at ten or eleven o'clock at night,
I heard the tread of a flock of geese, or else ducks, on the dry leaves in the woods by a pond-hole behind my dwelling, where they had come up to feed, and the faint honk or quack of their leader as they hurried off.
In 1845 Walden froze entirely over for the first time on the night of the 22d of
December, Flint's and other shallower ponds and the river having been frozen ten days or more; in '46, the 16th; in '49, about the 31st; and in '50, about the 27th of December; in '52, the 5th of January; in
'53, the 31st of December.
The snow had already covered the ground since the 25th of November, and surrounded me suddenly with the scenery of winter.
I withdrew yet farther into my shell, and endeavored to keep a bright fire both within my house and within my breast.
My employment out of doors now was to collect the dead wood in the forest, bringing it in my hands or on my shoulders, or sometimes trailing a dead pine tree under each arm to my shed.
An old forest fence which had seen its best days was a great haul for me.
I sacrificed it to Vulcan, for it was past serving the god Terminus.
How much more interesting an event is that man's supper who has just been forth in the snow to hunt, nay, you might say, steal, the fuel to cook it with!
His bread and meat are sweet.
There are enough fagots and waste wood of all kinds in the forests of most of our towns to support many fires, but which at present warm none, and, some think, hinder the growth of the young wood.
There was also the driftwood of the pond.
In the course of the summer I had discovered a raft of pitch pine logs with the bark on, pinned together by the Irish when the railroad was built.
This I hauled up partly on the shore.
After soaking two years and then lying high six months it was perfectly sound, though waterlogged past drying.
I amused myself one winter day with sliding this piecemeal across the pond, nearly half a mile, skating behind with one end of a log fifteen feet long on my shoulder, and the other on the ice; or I tied several logs together with a birch withe, and then, with a longer birch or alder which had a hook at the end, dragged them across.
Though completely waterlogged and almost as heavy as lead, they not only burned long, but made a very hot fire; nay, I thought that they burned better for the soaking, as if the pitch, being confined by the water, burned longer, as in a lamp.
Gilpin, in his account of the forest borderers of England, says that "the encroachments of trespassers, and the houses and fences thus raised on the borders of the forest," were "considered as great nuisances by the old forest law, and were severely punished under the name of purprestures, as tending ad terrorem ferarum--ad nocumentum forestae, etc.," to the frightening of the game and the detriment of the forest.
But I was interested in the preservation of the venison and the vert more than the hunters or woodchoppers, and as much as though I had been the Lord Warden himself; and if any part was burned, though I burned it myself by accident, I grieved with a grief that lasted longer and was more inconsolable than that of the proprietors; nay, I grieved when it was cut down by the proprietors themselves.
I would that our farmers when they cut down a forest felt some of that awe which the old Romans did when they came to thin, or let in the light to, a consecrated grove (lucum conlucare), that is, would believe that it is sacred to some god.
The Roman made an expiatory offering, and prayed, Whatever god or goddess thou art to whom this grove is sacred, be propitious to me, my family, and children, etc.
It is remarkable what a value is still put upon wood even in this age and in this new country, a value more permanent and universal than that of gold.
After all our discoveries and inventions no man will go by a pile of wood.
It is as precious to us as it was to our Saxon and Norman ancestors.
If they made their bows of it, we make our gun-stocks of it.
Michaux, more than thirty years ago, says that the price of wood for fuel in New York and Philadelphia "nearly equals, and sometimes exceeds, that of the best wood in
Paris, though this immense capital annually requires more than three hundred thousand cords, and is surrounded to the distance of three hundred miles by cultivated plains."
In this town the price of wood rises almost steadily, and the only question is, how much higher it is to be this year than it was the last.
Mechanics and tradesmen who come in person to the forest on no other errand, are sure to attend the wood auction, and even pay a high price for the privilege of gleaning after the woodchopper.
It is now many years that men have resorted to the forest for fuel and the materials of the arts: the New Englander and the New Hollander, the Parisian and the Celt, the farmer and Robin Hood, Goody Blake and
Harry Gill; in most parts of the world the prince and the peasant, the scholar and the savage, equally require still a few sticks from the forest to warm them and cook their food.
Neither could I do without them. Every man looks at his wood-pile with a kind of affection.
I love to have mine before my window, and the more chips the better to remind me of my pleasing work.
I had an old axe which nobody claimed, with which by spells in winter days, on the sunny side of the house, I played about the stumps which I had got out of my bean- field.
As my driver prophesied when I was plowing, they warmed me twice--once while I was splitting them, and again when they were on the fire, so that no fuel could give out more heat.
As for the axe, I was advised to get the village blacksmith to "jump" it; but I jumped him, and, putting a hickory helve from the woods into it, made it do.
If it was dull, it was at least hung true.
A few pieces of fat pine were a great treasure.
It is interesting to remember how much of this food for fire is still concealed in the bowels of the earth.
In previous years I had often gone prospecting over some bare hillside, where a pitch pine wood had formerly stood, and got out the fat pine roots.
They are almost indestructible.
Stumps thirty or forty years old, at least, will still be sound at the core, though the sapwood has all become vegetable mould, as appears by the scales of the thick bark forming a ring level with the earth four or five inches distant from the heart.
With axe and shovel you explore this mine, and follow the marrowy store, yellow as beef tallow, or as if you had struck on a vein of gold, deep into the earth.
But commonly I kindled my fire with the dry leaves of the forest, which I had stored up in my shed before the snow came.
Green hickory finely split makes the woodchopper's kindlings, when he has a camp in the woods.
Once in a while I got a little of this.
When the villagers were lighting their fires beyond the horizon, I too gave notice to the various wild inhabitants of Walden vale, by a smoky streamer from my chimney, that I was awake.--
Light-winged Smoke, Icarian bird, Melting thy pinions in thy upward flight,
Lark without song, and messenger of dawn, Circling above the hamlets as thy nest;
Or else, departing dream, and shadowy form Of midnight vision, gathering up thy skirts; By night star-veiling, and by day
Darkening the light and blotting out the sun;
Go thou my incense upward from this hearth, And ask the gods to pardon this clear flame.
Hard green wood just cut, though I used but little of that, answered my purpose better than any other.
I sometimes left a good fire when I went to take a walk in a winter afternoon; and when
I returned, three or four hours afterward, it would be still alive and glowing.
My house was not empty though I was gone.
It was as if I had left a cheerful housekeeper behind.
It was I and Fire that lived there; and commonly my housekeeper proved trustworthy.
One day, however, as I was splitting wood, I thought that I would just look in at the window and see if the house was not on fire; it was the only time I remember to have been particularly anxious on this score; so I looked and saw that a spark had caught my bed, and I went in and extinguished it when it had burned a place as big as my hand.
But my house occupied so sunny and sheltered a position, and its roof was so low, that I could afford to let the fire go out in the middle of almost any winter day.
The moles nested in my cellar, nibbling every third potato, and making a snug bed even there of some hair left after plastering and of brown paper; for even the wildest animals love comfort and warmth as well as man, and they survive the winter only because they are so careful to secure them.
Some of my friends spoke as if I was coming to the woods on purpose to freeze myself.
The animal merely makes a bed, which he warms with his body, in a sheltered place; but man, having discovered fire, boxes up some air in a spacious apartment, and warms that, instead of robbing himself, makes that his bed, in which he can move about divested of more cumbrous clothing, maintain a kind of summer in the midst of winter, and by means of windows even admit the light, and with a lamp lengthen out the day.
Thus he goes a step or two beyond instinct, and saves a little time for the fine arts.
Though, when I had been exposed to the rudest blasts a long time, my whole body began to grow torpid, when I reached the genial atmosphere of my house I soon recovered my faculties and prolonged my life.
But the most luxuriously housed has little to boast of in this respect, nor need we trouble ourselves to speculate how the human race may be at last destroyed.
It would be easy to cut their threads any time with a little sharper blast from the north.
We go on dating from Cold Fridays and Great Snows; but a little colder Friday, or greater snow would put a period to man's existence on the globe.
The next winter I used a small cooking- stove for economy, since I did not own the forest; but it did not keep fire so well as the open fireplace.
Cooking was then, for the most part, no longer a poetic, but merely a chemic process.
It will soon be forgotten, in these days of stoves, that we used to roast potatoes in the ashes, after the Indian fashion.
The stove not only took up room and scented the house, but it concealed the fire, and I felt as if I had lost a companion.
You can always see a face in the fire.
The laborer, looking into it at evening, purifies his thoughts of the dross and earthiness which they have accumulated during the day.
But I could no longer sit and look into the fire, and the pertinent words of a poet recurred to me with new force.--
"Never, bright flame, may be denied to me Thy dear, life imaging, close sympathy.
What but my hopes shot upward e'er so bright?
What but my fortunes sunk so low in night?
Why art thou banished from our hearth and hall,
Thou who art welcomed and beloved by all?
Was thy existence then too fanciful For our life's common light, who are so dull?
Did thy bright gleam mysterious converse hold
With our congenial souls? secrets too bold?
Well, we are safe and strong, for now we sit
Beside a hearth where no dim shadows flit,
Where nothing cheers nor saddens, but a fire
Warms feet and hands nor does to more aspire;
By whose compact utilitarian heap The present may sit down and go to sleep,
Nor fear the ghosts who from the dim past walked,
And with us by the unequal light of the old wood fire talked." &gt;
CHAPTER 14 Former Inhabitants and Winter Visitors
I weathered some merry snow-storms, and spent some cheerful winter evenings by my fireside, while the snow whirled wildly without, and even the hooting of the owl was hushed.
For many weeks I met no one in my walks but those who came occasionally to cut wood and sled it to the village.
The elements, however, abetted me in making a path through the deepest snow in the woods, for when I had once gone through the wind blew the oak leaves into my tracks, where they lodged, and by absorbing the rays of the sun melted the snow, and so not only made a my bed for my feet, but in the night their dark line was my guide.
For human society I was obliged to conjure up the former occupants of these woods.
Within the memory of many of my townsmen the road near which my house stands resounded with the laugh and gossip of inhabitants, and the woods which border it were notched and dotted here and there with their little gardens and dwellings, though it was then much more shut in by the forest than now.
In some places, within my own remembrance, the pines would scrape both sides of a chaise at once, and women and children who were compelled to go this way to Lincoln alone and on foot did it with fear, and often ran a good part of the distance.
Though mainly but a humble route to neighboring villages, or for the woodman's team, it once amused the traveller more than now by its variety, and lingered longer in his memory.
Where now firm open fields stretch from the village to the woods, it then ran through a maple swamp on a foundation of logs, the remnants of which, doubtless, still underlie the present dusty highway, from the Stratton, now the Alms-House Farm, to Brister's Hill.
East of my bean-field, across the road, lived Cato Ingraham, slave of Duncan
Ingraham, Esquire, gentleman, of Concord village, who built his slave a house, and gave him permission to live in Walden
Woods;--Cato, not Uticensis, but Concordiensis.
Some say that he was a Guinea Negro.
There are a few who remember his little patch among the walnuts, which he let grow up till he should be old and need them; but a younger and whiter speculator got them at last.
He too, however, occupies an equally narrow house at present.
Cato's half-obliterated cellar-hole still remains, though known to few, being concealed from the traveller by a fringe of pines.
It is now filled with the smooth sumach (Rhus glabra), and one of the earliest species of goldenrod (Solidago stricta) grows there luxuriantly.
Here, by the very corner of my field, still nearer to town, Zilpha, a colored woman, had her little house, where she spun linen for the townsfolk, making the Walden Woods ring with her shrill singing, for she had a loud and notable voice.
At length, in the war of 1812, her dwelling was set on fire by English soldiers, prisoners on parole, when she was away, and her cat and dog and hens were all burned up together.
She led a hard life, and somewhat inhumane.
One old frequenter of these woods remembers, that as he passed her house one noon he heard her muttering to herself over her gurgling pot--"Ye are all bones, bones!"
I have seen bricks amid the oak copse there.
Down the road, on the right hand, on Brister's Hill, lived Brister Freeman, "a handy Negro," slave of Squire Cummings once--there where grow still the apple trees which Brister planted and tended; large old trees now, but their fruit still wild and ciderish to my taste.
Not long since I read his epitaph in the old Lincoln burying-ground, a little on one side, near the unmarked graves of some British grenadiers who fell in the retreat from Concord--where he is styled "Sippio
Brister"--Scipio Africanus he had some title to be called--"a man of color," as if he were discolored.
It also told me, with staring emphasis, when he died; which was but an indirect way of informing me that he ever lived.
With him dwelt Fenda, his hospitable wife, who told fortunes, yet pleasantly--large, round, and black, blacker than any of the children of night, such a dusky orb as never rose on Concord before or since.
Farther down the hill, on the left, on the old road in the woods, are marks of some homestead of the Stratton family; whose orchard once covered all the slope of
Brister's Hill, but was long since killed out by pitch pines, excepting a few stumps, whose old roots furnish still the wild stocks of many a thrifty village tree.
Nearer yet to town, you come to Breed's location, on the other side of the way, just on the edge of the wood; ground famous for the pranks of a demon not distinctly named in old mythology, who has acted a prominent and astounding part in our New England life, and deserves, as much as any mythological character, to have his biography written one day; who first comes in the guise of a friend or hired man, and then robs and murders the whole family-- New-England Rum.
But history must not yet tell the tragedies enacted here; let time intervene in some measure to assuage and lend an azure tint to them.
Here the most indistinct and dubious tradition says that once a tavern stood; the well the same, which tempered the traveller's beverage and refreshed his steed.
Here then men saluted one another, and heard and told the news, and went their ways again.
Breed's hut was standing only a dozen years ago, though it had long been unoccupied.
It was about the size of mine.
It was set on fire by mischievous boys, one
Election night, if I do not mistake.
I lived on the edge of the village then, and had just lost myself over Davenant's
"Gondibert," that winter that I labored with a lethargy--which, by the way, I never knew whether to regard as a family complaint, having an uncle who goes to sleep shaving himself, and is obliged to sprout potatoes in a cellar Sundays, in order to keep awake and keep the Sabbath, or as the consequence of my attempt to read
Chalmers' collection of English poetry without skipping.
It fairly overcame my Nervii.
I had just sunk my head on this when the bells rung fire, and in hot haste the engines rolled that way, led by a straggling troop of men and boys, and I among the foremost, for I had leaped the brook.
We thought it was far south over the woods- -we who had run to fires before--barn, shop, or dwelling-house, or all together.
"It's Baker's barn," cried one.
"It is the Codman place," affirmed another.
And then fresh sparks went up above the wood, as if the roof fell in, and we all shouted "Concord to the rescue!"
Wagons shot past with furious speed and crushing loads, bearing, perchance, among the rest, the agent of the Insurance Company, who was bound to go however far; and ever and anon the engine bell tinkled behind, more slow and sure; and rearmost of all, as it was afterward whispered, came they who set the fire and gave the alarm.
Thus we kept on like true idealists, rejecting the evidence of our senses, until at a turn in the road we heard the crackling and actually felt the heat of the fire from over the wall, and realized, alas! that we were there.
The very nearness of the fire but cooled our ardor.
At first we thought to throw a frog-pond on to it; but concluded to let it burn, it was so far gone and so worthless.
So we stood round our engine, jostled one another, expressed our sentiments through speaking-trumpets, or in lower tone referred to the great conflagrations which the world has witnessed, including Bascom's shop, and, between ourselves, we thought that, were we there in season with our
"tub," and a full frog-pond by, we could turn that threatened last and universal one into another flood.
We finally retreated without doing any mischief--returned to sleep and
"Gondibert."
But as for "Gondibert," I would except that passage in the preface about wit being the soul's powder--"but most of mankind are strangers to wit, as Indians are to powder."
It chanced that I walked that way across the fields the following night, about the same hour, and hearing a low moaning at this spot, I drew near in the dark, and discovered the only survivor of the family that I know, the heir of both its virtues and its vices, who alone was interested in this burning, lying on his stomach and looking over the cellar wall at the still smouldering cinders beneath, muttering to himself, as is his wont.
He had been working far off in the river meadows all day, and had improved the first moments that he could call his own to visit the home of his fathers and his youth.
He gazed into the cellar from all sides and points of view by turns, always lying down to it, as if there was some treasure, which he remembered, concealed between the stones, where there was absolutely nothing but a heap of bricks and ashes.
The house being gone, he looked at what there was left.
He was soothed by the sympathy which my mere presence implied, and showed me, as well as the darkness permitted, where the well was covered up; which, thank Heaven, could never be burned; and he groped long about the wall to find the well-sweep which his father had cut and mounted, feeling for the iron hook or staple by which a burden had been fastened to the heavy end--all that he could now cling to--to convince me that it was no common "rider."
I felt it, and still remark it almost daily in my walks, for by it hangs the history of a family.
Once more, on the left, where are seen the well and lilac bushes by the wall, in the now open field, lived Nutting and Le Grosse.
But to return toward Lincoln.
Farther in the woods than any of these, where the road approaches nearest to the pond, Wyman the potter squatted, and furnished his townsmen with earthenware, and left descendants to succeed him.
Neither were they rich in worldly goods, holding the land by sufferance while they lived; and there often the sheriff came in vain to collect the taxes, and "attached a chip," for form's sake, as I have read in his accounts, there being nothing else that he could lay his hands on.
One day in midsummer, when I was hoeing, a man who was carrying a load of pottery to market stopped his horse against my field and inquired concerning Wyman the younger.
He had long ago bought a potter's wheel of him, and wished to know what had become of him.
I had read of the potter's clay and wheel in Scripture, but it had never occurred to me that the pots we use were not such as had come down unbroken from those days, or grown on trees like gourds somewhere, and I was pleased to hear that so fictile an art was ever practiced in my neighborhood.
The last inhabitant of these woods before me was an Irishman, Hugh Quoil (if I have spelt his name with coil enough), who occupied Wyman's tenement--Col.
Quoil, he was called.
Rumor said that he had been a soldier at Waterloo.
If he had lived I should have made him fight his battles over again.
His trade here was that of a ditcher.
Napoleon went to St. Helena; Quoil came to Walden Woods.
All I know of him is tragic.
He was a man of manners, like one who had seen the world, and was capable of more civil speech than you could well attend to.
He wore a greatcoat in midsummer, being affected with the trembling delirium, and his face was the color of carmine.
He died in the road at the foot of Brister's Hill shortly after I came to the woods, so that I have not remembered him as a neighbor.
Before his house was pulled down, when his comrades avoided it as "an unlucky castle,"
I visited it.
There lay his old clothes curled up by use, as if they were himself, upon his raised plank bed.
His pipe lay broken on the hearth, instead of a bowl broken at the fountain.
The last could never have been the symbol of his death, for he confessed to me that, though he had heard of Brister's Spring, he had never seen it; and soiled cards, kings of diamonds, spades, and hearts, were scattered over the floor.
One black chicken which the administrator could not catch, black as night and as silent, not even croaking, awaiting Reynard, still went to roost in the next apartment.
In the rear there was the dim outline of a garden, which had been planted but had never received its first hoeing, owing to those terrible shaking fits, though it was now harvest time.
It was overrun with Roman wormwood and beggar-ticks, which last stuck to my clothes for all fruit.
The skin of a woodchuck was freshly stretched upon the back of the house, a trophy of his last Waterloo; but no warm cap or mittens would he want more.
Now only a dent in the earth marks the site of these dwellings, with buried cellar stones, and strawberries, raspberries, thimble-berries, hazel-bushes, and sumachs growing in the sunny sward there; some pitch pine or gnarled oak occupies what was the chimney nook, and a sweet-scented black birch, perhaps, waves where the door-stone was.
Sometimes the well dent is visible, where once a spring oozed; now dry and tearless grass; or it was covered deep--not to be discovered till some late day--with a flat stone under the sod, when the last of the race departed.
What a sorrowful act must that be--the covering up of wells! coincident with the opening of wells of tears.
These cellar dents, like deserted fox burrows, old holes, are all that is left where once were the stir and bustle of human life, and "fate, free will, foreknowledge absolute," in some form and dialect or other were by turns discussed.
But all I can learn of their conclusions amounts to just this, that "Cato and
Brister pulled wool"; which is about as edifying as the history of more famous schools of philosophy.
Still grows the vivacious lilac a generation after the door and lintel and the sill are gone, unfolding its sweet- scented flowers each spring, to be plucked by the musing traveller; planted and tended once by children's hands, in front-yard plots--now standing by wallsides in retired pastures, and giving place to new-rising forests;--the last of that stirp, sole survivor of that family.
Little did the dusky children think that the puny slip with its two eyes only, which they stuck in the ground in the shadow of the house and daily watered, would root itself so, and outlive them, and house itself in the rear that shaded it, and grown man's garden and orchard, and tell their story faintly to the lone wanderer a half-century after they had grown up and died--blossoming as fair, and smelling as sweet, as in that first spring.
I mark its still tender, civil, cheerful lilac colors.
But this small village, germ of something more, why did it fail while Concord keeps its ground?
Were there no natural advantages--no water privileges, forsooth?
Ay, the deep Walden Pond and cool Brister's Spring--privilege to drink long and healthy draughts at these, all unimproved by these men but to dilute their glass.
They were universally a thirsty race.
Might not the basket, stable-broom, mat- making, corn-parching, linen-spinning, and pottery business have thrived here, making the wilderness to blossom like the rose, and a numerous posterity have inherited the land of their fathers?
The sterile soil would at least have been proof against a low-land degeneracy.
Alas! how little does the memory of these human inhabitants enhance the beauty of the
landscape!
Again, perhaps, Nature will try, with me for a first settler, and my house raised last spring to be the oldest in the hamlet.
I am not aware that any man has ever built on the spot which I occupy.
Deliver me from a city built on the site of a more ancient city, whose materials are ruins, whose gardens cemeteries.
The soil is blanched and accursed there, and before that becomes necessary the earth itself will be destroyed.
With such reminiscences I repeopled the woods and lulled myself asleep.
At this season I seldom had a visitor.
When the snow lay deepest no wanderer ventured near my house for a week or fortnight at a time, but there I lived as snug as a meadow mouse, or as cattle and poultry which are said to have survived for a long time buried in drifts, even without food; or like that early settler's family in the town of Sutton, in this State, whose cottage was completely covered by the great snow of 1717 when he was absent, and an
Indian found it only by the hole which the chimney's breath made in the drift, and so relieved the family.
But no friendly Indian concerned himself about me; nor needed he, for the master of the house was at home.
The Great Snow!
How cheerful it is to hear of!
When the farmers could not get to the woods and swamps with their teams, and were obliged to cut down the shade trees before their houses, and, when the crust was harder, cut off the trees in the swamps, ten feet from the ground, as it appeared the next spring.
In the deepest snows, the path which I used from the highway to my house, about half a mile long, might have been represented by a meandering dotted line, with wide intervals between the dots.
For a week of even weather I took exactly the same number of steps, and of the same length, coming and going, stepping deliberately and with the precision of a pair of dividers in my own deep tracks--to such routine the winter reduces us--yet often they were filled with heaven's own blue.
But no weather interfered fatally with my walks, or rather my going abroad, for I frequently tramped eight or ten miles through the deepest snow to keep an appointment with a beech tree, or a yellow birch, or an old acquaintance among the pines; when the ice and snow causing their
limbs to droop, and so sharpening their tops, had changed the pines into fir trees; wading to the tops of the highest hills when the show was nearly two feet deep on a level, and shaking down another snow-storm on my head at every step; or sometimes creeping and floundering thither on my hands and knees, when the hunters had gone into winter quarters.
One afternoon I amused myself by watching a barred owl (Strix nebulosa) sitting on one of the lower dead limbs of a white pine, close to the trunk, in broad daylight, I standing within a rod of him.
He could hear me when I moved and cronched the snow with my feet, but could not plainly see me.
When I made most noise he would stretch out his neck, and erect his neck feathers, and open his eyes wide; but their lids soon fell again, and he began to nod.
I too felt a slumberous influence after watching him half an hour, as he sat thus with his eyes half open, like a cat, winged brother of the cat.
There was only a narrow slit left between their lids, by which he preserved a peninsular relation to me; thus, with half- shut eyes, looking out from the land of dreams, and endeavoring to realize me, vague object or mote that interrupted his visions.
At length, on some louder noise or my nearer approach, he would grow uneasy and sluggishly turn about on his perch, as if impatient at having his dreams disturbed; and when he launched himself off and flapped through the pines, spreading his wings to unexpected breadth, I could not hear the slightest sound from them.
Thus, guided amid the pine boughs rather by a delicate sense of their neighborhood than by sight, feeling his twilight way, as it were, with his sensitive pinions, he found a new perch, where he might in peace await the dawning of his day.
As I walked over the long causeway made for the railroad through the meadows, I encountered many a blustering and nipping wind, for nowhere has it freer play; and when the frost had smitten me on one cheek, heathen as I was, I turned to it the other also.
Nor was it much better by the carriage road from Brister's Hill.
For I came to town still, like a friendly Indian, when the contents of the broad open fields were all piled up between the walls of the Walden road, and half an hour sufficed to obliterate the tracks of the last traveller.
And when I returned new drifts would have formed, through which I floundered, where the busy northwest wind had been depositing the powdery snow round a sharp angle in the road, and not a rabbit's track, nor even the fine print, the small type, of a meadow mouse was to be seen.
Yet I rarely failed to find, even in midwinter, some warm and springly swamp where the grass and the skunk-cabbage still put forth with perennial verdure, and some hardier bird occasionally awaited the return of spring.
Sometimes, notwithstanding the snow, when I returned from my walk at evening I crossed the deep tracks of a woodchopper leading from my door, and found his pile of whittlings on the hearth, and my house filled with the odor of his pipe.
Or on a Sunday afternoon, if I chanced to be at home, I heard the cronching of the snow made by the step of a long-headed farmer, who from far through the woods sought my house, to have a social "crack"; one of the few of his vocation who are "men on their farms"; who donned a frock instead of a professor's gown, and is as ready to extract the moral out of church or state as to haul a load of manure from his barn- yard.
We talked of rude and simple times, when men sat about large fires in cold, bracing weather, with clear heads; and when other dessert failed, we tried our teeth on many a nut which wise squirrels have long since abandoned, for those which have the thickest shells are commonly empty.
The one who came from farthest to my lodge, through deepest snows and most dismal tempests, was a poet.
A farmer, a hunter, a soldier, a reporter, even a philosopher, may be daunted; but nothing can deter a poet, for he is actuated by pure love.
Who can predict his comings and goings?
His business calls him out at all hours, even when doctors sleep.
We made that small house ring with boisterous mirth and resound with the murmur of much sober talk, making amends then to Walden vale for the long silences.
Broadway was still and deserted in comparison.
At suitable intervals there were regular salutes of laughter, which might have been referred indifferently to the last-uttered or the forth-coming jest.
We made many a "bran new" theory of life over a thin dish of gruel, which combined the advantages of conviviality with the clear-headedness which philosophy requires.
I should not forget that during my last winter at the pond there was another welcome visitor, who at one time came through the village, through snow and rain and darkness, till he saw my lamp through the trees, and shared with me some long winter evenings.
One of the last of the philosophers-- Connecticut gave him to the world--he peddled first her wares, afterwards, as he declares, his brains.
These he peddles still, prompting God and disgracing man, bearing for fruit his brain only, like the nut its kernel.
I think that he must be the man of the most faith of any alive.
His words and attitude always suppose a better state of things than other men are acquainted with, and he will be the last man to be disappointed as the ages revolve.
He has no venture in the present.
But though comparatively disregarded now, when his day comes, laws unsuspected by most will take effect, and masters of families and rulers will come to him for advice.
"How blind that cannot see serenity!" A true friend of man; almost the only friend of human progress.
An Old Mortality, say rather an Immortality, with unwearied patience and faith making plain the image engraven in men's bodies, the God of whom they are but defaced and leaning monuments.
With his hospitable intellect he embraces children, beggars, insane, and scholars, and entertains the thought of all, adding to it commonly some breadth and elegance.
I think that he should keep a caravansary on the world's highway, where philosophers of all nations might put up, and on his sign should be printed, "Entertainment for man, but not for his beast.
Enter ye that have leisure and a quiet mind, who earnestly seek the right road."
He is perhaps the sanest man and has the fewest crotchets of any I chance to know; the same yesterday and tomorrow.
Of yore we had sauntered and talked, and effectually put the world behind us; for he was pledged to no institution in it, freeborn, ingenuus.
Whichever way we turned, it seemed that the heavens and the earth had met together, since he enhanced the beauty of the landscape.
A blue-robed man, whose fittest roof is the overarching sky which reflects his serenity.
I do not see how he can ever die; Nature cannot spare him.
Having each some shingles of thought well dried, we sat and whittled them, trying our knives, and admiring the clear yellowish grain of the pumpkin pine.
We waded so gently and reverently, or we pulled together so smoothly, that the fishes of thought were not scared from the stream, nor feared any angler on the bank, but came and went grandly, like the clouds which float through the western sky, and the mother-o'-pearl flocks which sometimes form and dissolve there.
There we worked, revising mythology, rounding a fable here and there, and building castles in the air for which earth offered no worthy foundation.
Great Looker!
Great Expecter! to converse with whom was a New England Night's Entertainment.
Ah! such discourse we had, hermit and philosopher, and the old settler I have spoken of--we three--it expanded and racked my little house; I should not dare to say how many pounds' weight there was above the atmospheric pressure on every circular inch; it opened its seams so that they had to be calked with much dulness thereafter to stop the consequent leak;--but I had enough of that kind of oakum already picked.
There was one other with whom I had "solid seasons," long to be remembered, at his house in the village, and who looked in upon me from time to time; but I had no more for society there.
There too, as everywhere, I sometimes expected the Visitor who never comes.
The Vishnu Purana says, "The house-holder is to remain at eventide in his courtyard as long as it takes to milk a cow, or longer if he pleases, to await the arrival of a guest."
I often performed this duty of hospitality, waited long enough to milk a whole herd of cows, but did not see the man approaching from the town. &gt;
CHAPTER 15 Winter Animals
When the ponds were firmly frozen, they afforded not only new and shorter routes to many points, but new views from their surfaces of the familiar landscape around them.
When I crossed Flint's Pond, after it was covered with snow, though I had often paddled about and skated over it, it was so unexpectedly wide and so strange that I could think of nothing but Baffin's Bay.
The Lincoln hills rose up around me at the extremity of a snowy plain, in which I did not remember to have stood before; and the fishermen, at an indeterminable distance over the ice, moving slowly about with their wolfish dogs, passed for sealers, or Esquimaux, or in misty weather loomed like fabulous creatures, and I did not know whether they were giants or pygmies.
I took this course when I went to lecture in Lincoln in the evening, travelling in no road and passing no house between my own hut and the lecture room.
In Goose Pond, which lay in my way, a colony of muskrats dwelt, and raised their cabins high above the ice, though none could be seen abroad when I crossed it.
Walden, being like the rest usually bare of snow, or with only shallow and interrupted drifts on it, was my yard where I could walk freely when the snow was nearly two feet deep on a level elsewhere and the villagers were confined to their streets.
There, far from the village street, and except at very long intervals, from the jingle of sleigh-bells, I slid and skated, as in a vast moose-yard well trodden, overhung by oak woods and solemn pines bent down with snow or bristling with icicles.
For sounds in winter nights, and often in winter days, I heard the forlorn but melodious note of a hooting owl indefinitely far; such a sound as the frozen earth would yield if struck with a suitable plectrum, the very lingua vernacula of Walden Wood, and quite familiar to me at last, though I never saw the bird while it was making it.
I seldom opened my door in a winter evening without hearing it; Hoo hoo hoo, hoorer, hoo, sounded sonorously, and the first three syilables accented somewhat like how der do; or sometimes hoo, hoo only.
One night in the beginning of winter, before the pond froze over, about nine o'clock, I was startled by the loud honking of a goose, and, stepping to the door, heard the sound of their wings like a tempest in the woods as they flew low over my house.
They passed over the pond toward Fair Haven, seemingly deterred from settling by my light, their commodore honking all the while with a regular beat.
Suddenly an unmistakable cat-owl from very near me, with the most harsh and tremendous voice I ever heard from any inhabitant of the woods, responded at regular intervals to the goose, as if determined to expose and disgrace this intruder from Hudson's Bay by exhibiting a greater compass and volume of voice in a native, and boo-hoo him out of Concord horizon.
What do you mean by alarming the citadel at this time of night consecrated to me?
Do you think I am ever caught napping at such an hour, and that I have not got lungs and a larynx as well as yourself?
It was one of the most thrilling discords I ever heard.
And yet, if you had a discriminating ear, there were in it the elements of a concord such as these plains never saw nor heard.
I also heard the whooping of the ice in the pond, my great bed-fellow in that part of
Concord, as if it were restless in its bed and would fain turn over, were troubled with flatulency and had dreams; or I was waked by the cracking of the ground by the frost, as if some one had driven a team against my door, and in the morning would find a crack in the earth a quarter of a mile long and a third of an inch wide.
Sometimes I heard the foxes as they ranged over the snow-crust, in moonlight nights, in search of a partridge or other game, barking raggedly and demoniacally like forest dogs, as if laboring with some anxiety, or seeking expression, struggling for light and to be dogs outright and run freely in the streets; for if we take the ages into our account, may there not be a civilization going on among brutes as well as men?
They seemed to me to be rudimental, burrowing men, still standing on their defence, awaiting their transformation.
Sometimes one came near to my window, attracted by my light, barked a vulpine curse at me, and then retreated.
Usually the red squirrel (Sciurus Hudsonius) waked me in the dawn, coursing over the roof and up and down the sides of the house, as if sent out of the woods for this purpose.
In the course of the winter I threw out half a bushel of ears of sweet corn, which had not got ripe, on to the snow-crust by my door, and was amused by watching the motions of the various animals which were baited by it.
In the twilight and the night the rabbits came regularly and made a hearty meal.
All day long the red squirrels came and went, and afforded me much entertainment by their manoeuvres.
One would approach at first warily through the shrub oaks, running over the snow-crust by fits and starts like a leaf blown by the wind, now a few paces this way, with wonderful speed and waste of energy, making inconceivable haste with his "trotters," as if it were for a wager, and now as many paces that way, but never getting on more than half a rod at a time; and then suddenly pausing with a ludicrous expression and a gratuitous somerset, as if all the eyes in the universe were eyed on him--for all the motions of a squirrel, even in the most solitary recesses of the forest, imply spectators as much as those of a dancing girl--wasting more time in delay and circumspection than would have sufficed to walk the whole distance--I never saw one walk--and then suddenly, before you could say Jack Robinson, he would be in the top of a young pitch pine, winding up his clock and chiding all imaginary spectators, soliloquizing and talking to all the universe at the same time--for no reason that I could ever detect, or he himself was aware of, I suspect.
At length he would reach the corn, and selecting a suitable ear, frisk about in the same uncertain trigonometrical way to the topmost stick of my wood-pile, before my window, where he looked me in the face, and there sit for hours, supplying himself with a new ear from time to time, nibbling at first voraciously and throwing the half- naked cobs about; till at length he grew more dainty still and played with his food, tasting only the inside of the kernel, and the ear, which was held balanced over the stick by one paw, slipped from his careless grasp and fell to the ground, when he would look over at it with a ludicrous expression of uncertainty, as if suspecting that it had life, with a mind not made up whether to get it again, or a new one, or be off; now thinking of corn, then listening to hear what was in the wind.
So the little impudent fellow would waste many an ear in a forenoon; till at last, seizing some longer and plumper one, considerably bigger than himself, and skilfully balancing it, he would set out with it to the woods, like a tiger with a buffalo, by the same zig-zag course and frequent pauses, scratching along with it as if it were too heavy for him and falling all the while, making its fall a diagonal between a perpendicular and horizontal, being determined to put it through at any rate;--a singularly frivolous and whimsical fellow;--and so he would get off with it to where he lived, perhaps carry it to the top of a pine tree forty or fifty rods distant, and I would afterwards find the cobs strewn about the woods in various directions.
At length the jays arrive, whose discordant screams were heard long before, as they were warily making their approach an eighth of a mile off, and in a stealthy and sneaking manner they flit from tree to tree, nearer and nearer, and pick up the kernels which the squirrels have dropped.
Then, sitting on a pitch pine bough, they attempt to swallow in their haste a kernel which is too big for their throats and chokes them; and after great labor they disgorge it, and spend an hour in the endeavor to crack it by repeated blows with their bills.
They were manifestly thieves, and I had not much respect for them; but the squirrels, though at first shy, went to work as if they were taking what was their own.
Meanwhile also came the chickadees in flocks, which, picking up the crumbs the squirrels had dropped, flew to the nearest twig and, placing them under their claws, hammered away at them with their little bills, as if it were an insect in the bark, till they were sufficiently reduced for their slender throats.
A little flock of these titmice came daily to pick a dinner out of my woodpile, or the crumbs at my door, with faint flitting lisping notes, like the tinkling of icicles in the grass, or else with sprightly day day day, or more rarely, in spring-like days, a wiry summery phe-be from the woodside.
They were so familiar that at length one alighted on an armful of wood which I was carrying in, and pecked at the sticks without fear.
I once had a sparrow alight upon my shoulder for a moment while I was hoeing in a village garden, and I felt that I was more distinguished by that circumstance than I should have been by any epaulet I could have worn.
The squirrels also grew at last to be quite familiar, and occasionally stepped upon my shoe, when that was the nearest way.
When the ground was not yet quite covered, and again near the end of winter, when the snow was melted on my south hillside and about my wood-pile, the partridges came out of the woods morning and evening to feed there.
Whichever side you walk in the woods the partridge bursts away on whirring wings, jarring the snow from the dry leaves and twigs on high, which comes sifting down in the sunbeams like golden dust, for this brave bird is not to be scared by winter.
It is frequently covered up by drifts, and, it is said, "sometimes plunges from on wing into the soft snow, where it remains concealed for a day or two."
I used to start them in the open land also, where they had come out of the woods at sunset to "bud" the wild apple trees.
They will come regularly every evening to particular trees, where the cunning sportsman lies in wait for them, and the distant orchards next the woods suffer thus not a little.
I am glad that the partridge gets fed, at any rate.
It is Nature's own bird which lives on buds and diet drink.
In dark winter mornings, or in short winter afternoons, I sometimes heard a pack of hounds threading all the woods with hounding cry and yelp, unable to resist the instinct of the chase, and the note of the hunting-horn at intervals, proving that man was in the rear.
The woods ring again, and yet no fox bursts forth on to the open level of the pond, nor following pack pursuing their Actaeon.
And perhaps at evening I see the hunters returning with a single brush trailing from their sleigh for a trophy, seeking their inn.
They tell me that if the fox would remain in the bosom of the frozen earth he would be safe, or if he would run in a straight line away no foxhound could overtake him; but, having left his pursuers far behind, he stops to rest and listen till they come up, and when he runs he circles round to his old haunts, where the hunters await him.
Sometimes, however, he will run upon a wall many rods, and then leap off far to one side, and he appears to know that water will not retain his scent.
A hunter told me that he once saw a fox pursued by hounds burst out on to Walden when the ice was covered with shallow puddles, run part way across, and then return to the same shore.
Ere long the hounds arrived, but here they lost the scent.
Sometimes a pack hunting by themselves would pass my door, and circle round my house, and yelp and hound without regarding me, as if afflicted by a species of madness, so that nothing could divert them from the pursuit.
Thus they circle until they fall upon the recent trail of a fox, for a wise hound will forsake everything else for this.
One day a man came to my hut from Lexington to inquire after his hound that made a large track, and had been hunting for a week by himself.
But I fear that he was not the wiser for all I told him, for every time I attempted to answer his questions he interrupted me by asking, "What do you do here?"
He had lost a dog, but found a man.
One old hunter who has a dry tongue, who used to come to bathe in Walden once every year when the water was warmest, and at such times looked in upon me, told me that many years ago he took his gun one afternoon and went out for a cruise in Walden Wood; and as he walked the Wayland road he heard the cry of hounds approaching, and ere long a fox leaped the wall into the road, and as quick as thought
leaped the other wall out of the road, and his swift bullet had not touched him.
Some way behind came an old hound and her three pups in full pursuit, hunting on their own account, and disappeared again in the woods.
Late in the afternoon, as he was resting in the thick woods south of Walden, he heard the voice of the hounds far over toward Fair Haven still pursuing the fox; and on they came, their hounding cry which made all the woods ring sounding nearer and nearer, now from Well Meadow, now from the
Baker Farm.
For a long time he stood still and listened to their music, so sweet to a hunter's ear, when suddenly the fox appeared, threading the solemn aisles with an easy coursing pace, whose sound was concealed by a sympathetic rustle of the leaves, swift and still, keeping the round, leaving his pursuers far behind; and, leaping upon a rock amid the woods, he sat erect and listening, with his back to the hunter.
For a moment compassion restrained the latter's arm; but that was a short-lived mood, and as quick as thought can follow thought his piece was levelled, and whang!-
-the fox, rolling over the rock, lay dead on the ground.
The hunter still kept his place and listened to the hounds.
Still on they came, and now the near woods resounded through all their aisles with their demoniac cry.
At length the old hound burst into view with muzzle to the ground, and snapping the air as if possessed, and ran directly to the rock; but, spying the dead fox, she suddenly ceased her hounding as if struck dumb with amazement, and walked round and round him in silence; and one by one her pups arrived, and, like their mother, were sobered into silence by the mystery.
Then the hunter came forward and stood in their midst, and the mystery was solved.
They waited in silence while he skinned the fox, then followed the brush a while, and at length turned off into the woods again.
That evening a Weston squire came to the Concord hunter's cottage to inquire for his hounds, and told how for a week they had been hunting on their own account from
Weston woods.
The Concord hunter told him what he knew and offered him the skin; but the other declined it and departed.
He did not find his hounds that night, but the next day learned that they had crossed the river and put up at a farmhouse for the night, whence, having been well fed, they took their departure early in the morning.
The hunter who told me this could remember one Sam Nutting, who used to hunt bears on
Fair Haven Ledges, and exchange their skins for rum in Concord village; who told him, even, that he had seen a moose there.
Nutting had a famous foxhound named Burgoyne--he pronounced it Bugine--which my informant used to borrow.
In the "Wast Book" of an old trader of this town, who was also a captain, town-clerk, and representative, I find the following entry.
Jan. 18th, 1742-3, "John Melven Cr. by 1 Grey Fox 0--2--3"; they are not now found here; and in his ledger, Feb, 7th, 1743, Hezekiah Stratton has credit "by 1/2 a Catt skin 0-- 1--4-1/2"; of course, a wild-cat, for
Stratton was a sergeant in the old French war, and would not have got credit for hunting less noble game.
Credit is given for deerskins also, and they were daily sold.
One man still preserves the horns of the last deer that was killed in this vicinity, and another has told me the particulars of the hunt in which his uncle was engaged.
The hunters were formerly a numerous and merry crew here.
I remember well one gaunt Nimrod who would catch up a leaf by the roadside and play a strain on it wilder and more melodious, if my memory serves me, than any hunting-horn.
At midnight, when there was a moon, I sometimes met with hounds in my path prowling about the woods, which would skulk out of my way, as if afraid, and stand silent amid the bushes till I had passed.
Squirrels and wild mice disputed for my store of nuts.
There were scores of pitch pines around my house, from one to four inches in diameter, which had been gnawed by mice the previous winter--a Norwegian winter for them, for the snow lay long and deep, and they were obliged to mix a large proportion of pine bark with their other diet.
These trees were alive and apparently flourishing at midsummer, and many of them had grown a foot, though completely girdled; but after another winter such were without exception dead.
It is remarkable that a single mouse should thus be allowed a whole pine tree for its dinner, gnawing round instead of up and down it; but perhaps it is necessary in order to thin these trees, which are wont to grow up densely.
The hares (Lepus Americanus) were very familiar.
One had her form under my house all winter, separated from me only by the flooring, and she startled me each morning by her hasty departure when I began to stir--thump, thump, thump, striking her head against the floor timbers in her hurry.
They used to come round my door at dusk to nibble the potato parings which I had thrown out, and were so nearly the color of the ground that they could hardly be distinguished when still.
Sometimes in the twilight I alternately lost and recovered sight of one sitting motionless under my window.
When I opened my door in the evening, off they would go with a squeak and a bounce.
Near at hand they only excited my pity.
One evening one sat by my door two paces from me, at first trembling with fear, yet unwilling to move; a poor wee thing, lean and bony, with ragged ears and sharp nose, scant tail and slender paws.
It looked as if Nature no longer contained the breed of nobler bloods, but stood on her last toes.
Its large eyes appeared young and unhealthy, almost dropsical.
I took a step, and lo, away it scud with an elastic spring over the snow-crust, straightening its body and its limbs into graceful length, and soon put the forest between me and itself--the wild free venison, asserting its vigor and the dignity of Nature.
Not without reason was its slenderness.
Such then was its nature.
(Lepus, levipes, light-foot, some think.) What is a country without rabbits and partridges?
They are among the most simple and indigenous animal products; ancient and venerable families known to antiquity as to modern times; of the very hue and substance of Nature, nearest allied to leaves and to the ground--and to one another; it is either winged or it is legged.
It is hardly as if you had seen a wild creature when a rabbit or a partridge bursts away, only a natural one, as much to be expected as rustling leaves.
The partridge and the rabbit are still sure to thrive, like true natives of the soil, whatever revolutions occur.
If the forest is cut off, the sprouts and bushes which spring up afford them concealment, and they become more numerous than ever.
That must be a poor country indeed that does not support a hare.
Our woods teem with them both, and around every swamp may be seen the partridge or rabbit walk, beset with twiggy fences and horse-hair snares, which some cow-boy tends. &gt;
There's this word in Chinese "Xiang" that kind of means smells good It can describe a flower, food, really anything
But it's always a positive description for things
It's hard to translate into something other than mandarin
We have this word in Fiji-Hindi Called "Talanoa"
Really it is the feeling you get, late on a Friday night,
Surrounded by your friends Shooting the breeze,
But it's not quite that, It's a sort of warmer and friendlier version of small talk Just about everything you could think of off the top of your head
There's this Greek word, "meraki" That means to really put your soul, put your entire being into what you're doing, whether it's your hobby or it's your work You're doing it with love for what you're doing But it's one of those cultural things, that I've never been able to come up with a good translation
"Meraki," with passion, with love

CHAPTER I.
One morning, as Gregor Samsa was waking up from anxious dreams, he discovered that in bed he had been changed into a monstrous verminous bug.
He lay on his armour-hard back and saw, as he lifted his head up a little, his brown, arched abdomen divided up into rigid bow- like sections.
From this height the blanket, just about ready to slide off completely, could hardly stay in place.
His numerous legs, pitifully thin in comparison to the rest of his circumference, flickered helplessly before his eyes.
"What's happened to me," he thought.
It was no dream.
His room, a proper room for a human being, only somewhat too small, lay quietly between the four well-known walls.
Above the table, on which an unpacked collection of sample cloth goods was spread out--Samsa was a travelling salesman--hung the picture which he had cut out of an illustrated magazine a little while ago and set in a pretty gilt frame.
It was a picture of a woman with a fur hat and a fur boa.
She sat erect there, lifting up in the direction of the viewer a solid fur muff into which her entire forearm had disappeared.
Gregor's glance then turned to the window.
The dreary weather--the rain drops were falling audibly down on the metal window ledge--made him quite melancholy.
"Why don't I keep sleeping for a little while longer and forget all this foolishness," he thought.
But this was entirely impractical, for he was used to sleeping on his right side, and in his present state he couldn't get himself into this position.
No matter how hard he threw himself onto his right side, he always rolled again onto his back.
He must have tried it a hundred times, closing his eyes so that he would not have to see the wriggling legs, and gave up only when he began to feel a light, dull pain in his side which he had never felt before.
"O God," he thought, "what a demanding job I've chosen!
Day in, day out, on the road.
The stresses of selling are much greater than the work going on at head office, and, in addition to that, I have to cope with the problems of travelling, the worries about train connections, irregular bad food, temporary and constantly changing human relationships, which never come from the heart.
To hell with it all!"
He felt a slight itching on the top of his abdomen.
He slowly pushed himself on his back closer to the bed post so that he could lift his head more easily, found the itchy part, which was entirely covered with small white spots--he did not know what to make of them and wanted to feel the place with a leg.
But he retracted it immediately, for the contact felt like a cold shower all over him.
He slid back again into his earlier position.
"This getting up early," he thought, "makes a man quite idiotic.
A man must have his sleep.
Other travelling salesmen live like harem women.
For instance, when I come back to the inn during the course of the morning to write up the necessary orders, these gentlemen are just sitting down to breakfast.
If I were to try that with my boss, I'd be thrown out on the spot.
Still, who knows whether that mightn't be really good for me?
If I didn't hold back for my parents' sake, I'd have quit ages ago.
I would've gone to the boss and told him just what I think from the bottom of my heart.
He would've fallen right off his desk!
How weird it is to sit up at that desk and talk down to the employee from way up there.
The boss has trouble hearing, so the employee has to step up quite close to him.
Anyway, I haven't completely given up that hope yet.
Once I've got together the money to pay off my parents' debt to him--that should take another five or six years--I'll do it for sure.
Then I'll make the big break.
In any case, right now I have to get up.
My train leaves at five o'clock."
He looked over at the alarm clock ticking away by the chest of drawers.
"Good God!" he thought.
It was half past six, and the hands were going quietly on.
It was past the half hour, already nearly quarter to.
Could the alarm have failed to ring?
One saw from the bed that it was properly set for four o'clock.
Certainly it had rung.
Yes, but was it possible to sleep through that noise which made the furniture shake?
Now, it's true he'd not slept quietly, but evidently he'd slept all the more deeply.
Still, what should he do now?
The next train left at seven o'clock.
To catch that one, he would have to go in a mad rush.
The sample collection wasn't packed up yet, and he really didn't feel particularly fresh and active.
And even if he caught the train, there was no avoiding a blow-up with the boss, because the firm's errand boy would've waited for the five o'clock train and reported the news of his absence long ago.
He was the boss's minion, without backbone or intelligence.
Well then, what if he reported in sick?
But that would be extremely embarrassing and suspicious, because during his five years' service Gregor hadn't been sick even once.
The boss would certainly come with the doctor from the health insurance company and would reproach his parents for their lazy son and cut short all objections with the insurance doctor's comments; for him everyone was completely healthy but really lazy about work.
And besides, would the doctor in this case be totally wrong?
Apart from a really excessive drowsiness after the long sleep, Gregor in fact felt quite well and even had a really strong appetite.
As he was thinking all this over in the greatest haste, without being able to make the decision to get out of bed--the alarm clock was indicating exactly quarter to seven--there was a cautious knock on the door by the head of the bed.
"Gregor," a voice called--it was his mother!--"it's quarter to seven.
Don't you want to be on your way?"
The soft voice!
Gregor was startled when he heard his voice answering.
It was clearly and unmistakably his earlier voice, but in it was intermingled, as if from below, an irrepressibly painful squeaking, which left the words positively distinct only in the first moment and distorted them in the reverberation, so that one didn't know if one had heard correctly.
Gregor wanted to answer in detail and explain everything, but in these circumstances he confined himself to saying, "Yes, yes, thank you mother.
I'm getting up right away."
Because of the wooden door the change in Gregor's voice was not really noticeable outside, so his mother calmed down with this explanation and shuffled off.
However, as a result of the short conversation, the other family members became aware that Gregor was unexpectedly still at home, and already his father was knocking on one side door, weakly but with his fist.
"Gregor, Gregor," he called out, "what's going on?"
And, after a short while, he urged him on again in a deeper voice:
"Gregor!"
Gregor!" At the other side door, however, his sister knocked lightly.
"Gregor?
Are you all right?
Do you need anything?"
Gregor directed answers in both directions,
"I'll be ready right away."
He made an effort with the most careful articulation and by inserting long pauses between the individual words to remove everything remarkable from his voice.
His father turned back to his breakfast.
However, the sister whispered, "Gregor, open the door--I beg you."
Gregor had no intention of opening the door, but congratulated himself on his precaution, acquired from travelling, of locking all doors during the night, even at home.
First he wanted to stand up quietly and undisturbed, get dressed, above all have breakfast, and only then consider further action, for--he noticed this clearly--by thinking things over in bed he would not reach a reasonable conclusion.
He remembered that he had already often felt a light pain or other in bed, perhaps the result of an awkward lying position, which later turned out to be purely imaginary when he stood up, and he was eager to see how his present fantasies would gradually dissipate.
That the change in his voice was nothing other than the onset of a real chill, an occupational illness of commercial travellers, of that he had not the slightest doubt.
It was very easy to throw aside the blanket.
He needed only to push himself up a little, and it fell by itself.
But to continue was difficult, particularly because he was so unusually wide.
He needed arms and hands to push himself upright.
Instead of these, however, he had only many small limbs which were incessantly moving with very different motions and which, in addition, he was unable to control.
If he wanted to bend one of them, then it was the first to extend itself, and if he finally succeeded doing what he wanted with this limb, in the meantime all the others, as if left free, moved around in an excessively painful agitation.
"But I must not stay in bed uselessly," said Gregor to himself.
At first he wanted to get out of bed with the lower part of his body, but this lower part--which, by the way, he had not yet looked at and which he also couldn't picture clearly--proved itself too difficult to move.
The attempt went so slowly.
When, having become almost frantic, he finally hurled himself forward with all his force and without thinking, he chose his direction incorrectly, and he hit the lower bedpost hard.
The violent pain he felt revealed to him that the lower part of his body was at the moment probably the most sensitive.
Thus, he tried to get his upper body out of the bed first and turned his head carefully toward the edge of the bed.
He managed to do this easily, and in spite of its width and weight his body mass at last slowly followed the turning of his head.
But as he finally raised his head outside the bed in the open air, he became anxious about moving forward any further in this manner, for if he allowed himself eventually to fall by this process, it would take a miracle to prevent his head from getting injured.
And at all costs he must not lose consciousness right now.
He preferred to remain in bed.
However, after a similar effort, while he lay there again, sighing as before, and once again saw his small limbs fighting one another, if anything worse than earlier, and didn't see any chance of imposing quiet and order on this arbitrary movement, he told himself again that he couldn't possibly remain in bed and that it might be the most reasonable thing to sacrifice everything if there was even the slightest hope of getting himself out of bed in the process.
At the same moment, however, he didn't forget to remind himself from time to time of the fact that calm--indeed the calmest-- reflection might be better than the most confused decisions.
At such moments, he directed his gaze as precisely as he could toward the window, but unfortunately there was little confident cheer to be had from a glance at the morning mist, which concealed even the other side of the narrow street.
"It's already seven o'clock," he told himself at the latest striking of the alarm clock, "already seven o'clock and still such a fog."
And for a little while longer he lay quietly with weak breathing, as if perhaps waiting for normal and natural conditions to re-emerge out of the complete stillness.
But then he said to himself, "Before it strikes a quarter past seven, whatever happens I must be completely out of bed.
Besides, by then someone from the office will arrive to inquire about me, because the office will open before seven o'clock."
And he made an effort then to rock his entire body length out of the bed with a uniform motion.
If he let himself fall out of the bed in this way, his head, which in the course of the fall he intended to lift up sharply, would probably remain uninjured.
His back seemed to be hard; nothing would really happen to that as a result of the fall.
His greatest reservation was a worry about the loud noise which the fall must create and which presumably would arouse, if not fright, then at least concern on the other side of all the doors.
However, it had to be tried.
As Gregor was in the process of lifting himself half out of bed--the new method was more of a game than an effort; he needed only to rock with a constant rhythm--it struck him how easy all this would be if someone were to come to his aid.
Two strong people--he thought of his father and the servant girl--would have been quite sufficient.
They would have only had to push their arms under his arched back to get him out of the bed, to bend down with their load, and then merely to exercise patience and care that he completed the flip onto the floor, where his diminutive legs would then, he hoped, acquire a purpose.
Now, quite apart from the fact that the doors were locked, should he really call out for help?
In spite of all his distress, he was unable to suppress a smile at this idea.
He had already got to the point where, by rocking more strongly, he maintained his equilibrium with difficulty, and very soon he would finally have to decide, for in five minutes it would be a quarter past seven.
Then there was a ring at the door of the apartment.
"That's someone from the office," he told himself, and he almost froze while his small limbs only danced around all the faster.
For one moment everything remained still.
"They aren't opening," Gregor said to himself, caught up in some absurd hope.
But of course then, as usual, the servant girl with her firm tread went to the door and opened it.
Gregor needed to hear only the first word of the visitor's greeting to recognize immediately who it was, the manager himself.
Why was Gregor the only one condemned to work in a firm where, at the slightest lapse, someone immediately attracted the greatest suspicion?
Were all the employees then collectively, one and all, scoundrels?
Among them was there then no truly devoted person who, if he failed to use just a couple of hours in the morning for office work, would become abnormal from pangs of conscience and really be in no state to get out of bed?
Was it really not enough to let an apprentice make inquiries, if such questioning was even necessary?
Must the manager himself come, and in the process must it be demonstrated to the entire innocent family that the investigation of this suspicious circumstance could be entrusted only to the intelligence of the manager?
And more as a consequence of the excited state in which this idea put Gregor than as a result of an actual decision, he swung himself with all his might out of the bed.
There was a loud thud, but not a real crash.
The fall was absorbed somewhat by the carpet and, in addition, his back was more elastic than Gregor had thought.
For that reason the dull noise was not quite so conspicuous.
But he had not held his head up with sufficient care and had hit it.
He turned his head, irritated and in pain, and rubbed it on the carpet.
"Something has fallen in there," said the manager in the next room on the left.
Gregor tried to imagine to himself whether anything similar to what was happening to him today could have also happened at some point to the manager.
At least one had to concede the possibility of such a thing.
However, as if to give a rough answer to this question, the manager now, with a squeak of his polished boots, took a few determined steps in the next room.
From the neighbouring room on the right the sister was whispering to inform Gregor:
"Gregor, the manager is here." "I know," said Gregor to himself.
But he did not dare make his voice loud enough so that his sister could hear.
"Gregor," his father now said from the neighbouring room on the left, "Mr. Manager has come and is asking why you have not left on the early train.
We don't know what we should tell him.
He will be good enough to forgive the mess in your room."
So please open the door.
In the middle of all this, the manager called out in a friendly way, "Good morning, Mr. Samsa."
"He is not well," said his mother to the manager, while his father was still talking at the door, "He is not well, believe me, Mr. Manager.
Otherwise how would Gregor miss a train?
The young man has nothing in his head except business.
I'm almost angry that he never goes out at night.
Right now he's been in the city eight days, but he's been at home every evening.
He sits here with us at the table and reads the newspaper quietly or studies his travel schedules.
It's a quite a diversion for him to busy himself with fretwork.
For instance, he cut out a small frame over the course of two or three evenings.
You'd be amazed how pretty it is.
It's hanging right inside the room.
You'll see it immediately, as soon as
Gregor opens the door.
Anyway, I'm happy that you're here, Mr.
Manager.
By ourselves, we would never have made Gregor open the door.
He's so stubborn, and he's certainly not well, although he denied that this morning."
"I'm coming right away," said Gregor slowly and deliberately and didn't move, so as not to lose one word of the conversation.
"My dear lady, I cannot explain it to myself in any other way," said the manager;
"I hope it is nothing serious.
On the other hand, I must also say that we business people, luckily or unluckily, however one looks at it, very often simply have to overcome a slight indisposition for business reasons."
"So can Mr. Manager come in to see you now?" asked his father impatiently and knocked once again on the door.
"No," said Gregor.
In the neighbouring room on the left a painful stillness descended.
In the neighbouring room on the right the sister began to sob.
Why didn't his sister go to the others?
She'd probably just gotten up out of bed now and hadn't even started to get dressed yet.
Then why was she crying?
Because he wasn't getting up and wasn't letting the manager in, because he was in danger of losing his position, and because then his boss would badger his parents once again with the old demands?
Those were probably unnecessary worries right now.
Gregor was still here and wasn't thinking at all about abandoning his family.
At the moment he was lying right there on the carpet, and no one who knew about his condition would've seriously demanded that he let the manager in.
But Gregor wouldn't be casually dismissed right way because of this small discourtesy, for which he would find an easy and suitable excuse later on.
It seemed to Gregor that it might be far more reasonable to leave him in peace at the moment, instead of disturbing him with crying and conversation.
But it was the very uncertainty which distressed the others and excused their behaviour.
"Mr. Samsa," the manager was now shouting, his voice raised, "what's the matter?
You are barricading yourself in your room, answer with only a yes and a no, are making serious and unnecessary troubles for your parents, and neglecting (I mention this only incidentally) your commercial duties in a truly unheard of manner.
I am speaking here in the name of your parents and your employer, and I am requesting you in all seriousness for an immediate and clear explanation.
I am amazed.
I am amazed.
I thought I knew you as a calm, reasonable person, and now you appear suddenly to want to start parading around in weird moods.
The Chief indicated to me earlier this very day a possible explanation for your neglect--it concerned the collection of cash entrusted to you a short while ago-- but in truth I almost gave him my word of honour that this explanation could not be correct.
However, now I see here your unimaginable pig headedness, and I am totally losing any desire to speak up for you in the slightest.
And your position is not at all the most secure.
Originally I intended to mention all this to you privately, but since you are letting me waste my time here uselessly, I don't know why the matter shouldn't come to the attention of your parents.
Your productivity has also been very unsatisfactory recently.
Of course, it's not the time of year to conduct exceptional business, we recognize that, but a time of year for conducting no business, there is no such thing at all,
Mr. Samsa, and such a thing must never be."
"But Mr. Manager," called Gregor, beside himself and, in his agitation, forgetting everything else, "I'm opening the door immediately, this very moment.
A slight indisposition, a dizzy spell, has prevented me from getting up.
I'm still lying in bed right now.
But I'm quite refreshed once again.
I'm in the midst of getting out of bed.
Just have patience for a short moment!
Things are not going as well as I thought.
But things are all right.
How suddenly this can overcome someone!
Only yesterday evening everything was fine with me.
My parents certainly know that.
Actually just yesterday evening I had a small premonition.
People must have seen that in me.
Why have I not reported that to the office?
But people always think that they'll get over sickness without having to stay at home.
Mr. Manager!
Take it easy on my parents!
There is really no basis for the criticisms which you're now making against me, and really nobody has said a word to me about that.
Perhaps you have not read the latest orders which I shipped.
Besides, now I'm setting out on my trip on the eight o'clock train; the few hours' rest have made me stronger.
Mr. Manager, do not stay. I will be at the office in person right away.
Please have the goodness to say that and to convey my respects to the Chief."
While Gregor was quickly blurting all this out, hardly aware of what he was saying, he had moved close to the chest of drawers without effort, probably as a result of the practice he had already had in bed, and now he was trying to raise himself up on it.
Actually, he wanted to open the door.
He really wanted to let himself be seen by and to speak with the manager.
He was keen to witness what the others now asking about him would say when they saw him.
If they were startled, then Gregor had no more responsibility and could be calm.
But if they accepted everything quietly, then he would have no reason to get excited and, if he got a move on, could really be at the station around eight o'clock.
At first he slid down a few times on the smooth chest of drawers.
But at last he gave himself a final swing and stood upright there.
He was no longer at all aware of the pains in his lower body, no matter how they might still sting.
Now he let himself fall against the back of a nearby chair, on the edge of which he braced himself with his thin limbs.
By doing this he gained control over himself and kept quiet, for he could now hear the manager.
"Did you understood a single word?" the manager asked the parents, "Is he playing the fool with us?"
"For God's sake," cried the mother already in tears, "perhaps he's very ill and we're upsetting him.
Grete!
Grete!" she yelled at that point.
"Mother?" called the sister from the other side.
They were making themselves understood through Gregor's room.
"You must go to the doctor right away.
Gregor is sick.
Hurry to the doctor.
Have you heard Gregor speak yet?"
"That was an animal's voice," said the manager, remarkably quietly in comparison to the mother's cries.
"Anna!
Anna!' yelled the father through the hall into the kitchen, clapping his hands,
"fetch a locksmith right away!"
The two young women were already running through the hall with swishing skirts--how had his sister dressed herself so quickly?- -and yanked open the doors of the apartment.
They probably had left them open, as is customary in an apartment where a huge misfortune has taken place.
However, Gregor had become much calmer.
All right, people did not understand his words any more, although they seemed clear enough to him, clearer than previously, perhaps because his ears had gotten used to them.
But at least people now thought that things were not all right with him and were prepared to help him.
The confidence and assurance with which the first arrangements had been carried out made him feel good.
He felt himself included once again in the circle of humanity and was expecting from both the doctor and the locksmith, without differentiating between them with any real precision, splendid and surprising results.
In order to get as clear a voice as possible for the critical conversation which was imminent, he coughed a little, and certainly took the trouble to do this in a really subdued way, since it was possible that even this noise sounded like something different from a human cough.
He no longer trusted himself to decide any more.
Meanwhile in the next room it had become really quiet.
Perhaps his parents were sitting with the manager at the table whispering; perhaps they were all leaning against the door listening.
Gregor pushed himself slowly towards the door, with the help of the easy chair, let go of it there, threw himself against the door, held himself upright against it--the balls of his tiny limbs had a little sticky stuff on them--and rested there momentarily from his exertion.
Then he made an effort to turn the key in the lock with his mouth.
Unfortunately it seemed that he had no real teeth.
How then was he to grab hold of the key?
But to make up for that his jaws were naturally very strong; with their help he managed to get the key really moving.
He didn't notice that he was obviously inflicting some damage on himself, for a brown fluid came out of his mouth, flowed over the key, and dripped onto the floor.
"Just listen for a moment," said the manager in the next room; "he's turning the key."
For Gregor that was a great encouragement.
But they all should've called out to him, including his father and mother, "Come on,
Gregor," they should've shouted; "keep going, keep working on the lock."
Imagining that all his efforts were being followed with suspense, he bit down frantically on the key with all the force he could muster.
As the key turned more, he danced around the lock.
Now he was holding himself upright only with his mouth, and he had to hang onto the key or then press it down again with the whole weight of his body, as necessary.
The quite distinct click of the lock as it finally snapped really woke Gregor up.
Breathing heavily he said to himself, "So I didn't need the locksmith," and he set his head against the door handle to open the door completely.
Because he had to open the door in this way, it was already open very wide without him yet being really visible.
He first had to turn himself slowly around the edge of the door, very carefully, of course, if he didn't want to fall awkwardly on his back right at the entrance into the room.
He was still preoccupied with this difficult movement and had no time to pay attention to anything else, when he heard the manager exclaim a loud "Oh!"--it sounded like the wind whistling--and now he saw him, nearest to the door, pressing his hand against his open mouth and moving slowly back, as if an invisible constant force was pushing him away.
His mother--in spite of the presence of the manager she was standing here with her hair sticking up on end, still a mess from the night--was looking at his father with her hands clasped.
She then went two steps towards Gregor and collapsed right in the middle of her skirts, which were spread out all around her, her face sunk on her breast, completely concealed.
His father clenched his fist with a hostile expression, as if he wished to push Gregor back into his room, then looked uncertainly around the living room, covered his eyes with his hands, and cried so that his mighty breast shook.
At this point Gregor did not take one step into the room, but leaned his body from the inside against the firmly bolted wing of the door, so that only half his body was visible, as well as his head, tilted sideways, with which he peeped over at the others.
Meanwhile it had become much brighter.
Standing out clearly from the other side of the street was a part of the endless grey- black house situated opposite--it was a hospital--with its severe regular windows breaking up the facade.
The rain was still coming down, but only in large individual drops visibly and firmly thrown down one by one onto the ground.
The breakfast dishes were standing piled around on the table, because for his father breakfast was the most important meal time in the day, which he prolonged for hours by reading various newspapers.
Directly across on the opposite wall hung a photograph of Gregor from the time of his military service; it was a picture of him as a lieutenant, as he, smiling and worry free, with his hand on his sword, demanded respect for his bearing and uniform.
The door to the hall was ajar, and since the door to the apartment was also open, one could see out into the landing of the apartment and the start of the staircase going down.
"Now," said Gregor, well aware that he was the only one who had kept his composure.
"I'll get dressed right away, pack up the collection of samples, and set off.
You'll allow me to set out on my way, will you not?
You see, Mr. Manager, I am not pig-headed, and I am happy to work.
Travelling is exhausting, but I couldn't live without it.
Where are you going, Mr. Manager?
To the office?
Really?
Will you report everything truthfully?
A person can be incapable of work momentarily, but that's precisely the best time to remember the earlier achievements and to consider that later, after the obstacles have been shoved aside, the person will work all the more eagerly and intensely.
I am really so indebted to Mr. Chief--you know that perfectly well.
On the other hand, I am concerned about my parents and my sister.
I'm in a fix, but I'll work myself out of it again.
Don't make things more difficult for me than they already are.
Speak up on my behalf in the office!
People don't like travelling salesmen.
I know that.
People think they earn pots of money and thus lead a fine life.
People don't even have any special reason to think through this judgment more clearly.
But you, Mr. Manager, you have a better perspective on what's involved than other people, even, I tell you in total confidence, a better perspective than Mr.
Chairman himself, who in his capacity as the employer may let his judgment make casual mistakes at the expense of an employee.
You also know well enough that the travelling salesman who is outside the office almost the entire year can become so easily a victim of gossip, coincidences, and groundless complaints, against which it's impossible for him to defend himself, since for the most part he doesn't hear about them at all and only then when he's exhausted after finishing a trip and at home gets to feel in his own body the nasty consequences, which can't be thoroughly explored back to their origins.
Mr. Manager, don't leave without speaking a word telling me that you'll at least concede that I'm a little in the right!"
But at Gregor's first words the manager had already turned away, and now he looked back at Gregor over his twitching shoulders with pursed lips.
During Gregor's speech he was not still for a moment but kept moving away towards the door, without taking his eyes off Gregor, but really gradually, as if there was a secret ban on leaving the room.
He was already in the hall, and given the sudden movement with which he finally pulled his foot out of the living room, one could have believed that he had just burned the sole of his foot.
In the hall, however, he stretched his right hand out away from his body towards the staircase, as if some truly supernatural relief was waiting for him there.
Gregor realized that he must not under any circumstances allow the manager to go away in this frame of mind, especially if his position in the firm was not to be placed in the greatest danger.
His parents did not understand all this very well.
Over the long years, they had developed the conviction that Gregor was set up for life in his firm and, in addition, they had so much to do nowadays with their present troubles that all foresight was foreign to them.
But Gregor had this foresight.
The manager must be held back, calmed down, convinced, and finally won over.
The future of Gregor and his family really depended on it!
If only the sister had been there!
She was clever.
She had already cried while Gregor was still lying quietly on his back.
And the manager, this friend of the ladies, would certainly let himself be guided by her.
She would have closed the door to the apartment and talked him out of his fright in the hall.
But the sister was not even there.
Gregor must deal with it himself.
Without thinking that as yet he didn't know anything about his present ability to move and that his speech possibly--indeed probably--had once again not been understood, he left the wing of the door, pushed himself through the opening, and wanted to go over to the manager, who was already holding tight onto the handrail with both hands on the landing in a ridiculous way.
But as he looked for something to hold onto, with a small scream Gregor immediately fell down onto his numerous little legs.
Scarcely had this happened, when he felt for the first time that morning a general physical well being.
The small limbs had firm floor under them; they obeyed perfectly, as he noticed to his joy, and strove to carry him forward in the direction he wanted.
Right away he believed that the final amelioration of all his suffering was immediately at hand.
But at the very moment when he lay on the floor rocking in a restrained manner quite close and directly across from his mother, who had apparently totally sunk into herself, she suddenly sprang right up with her arms spread far apart and her fingers extended and cried out, "Help, for God's sake, help!"
She held her head bowed down, as if she wanted to view Gregor better, but ran senselessly back, contradicting that gesture, forgetting that behind her stood the table with all the dishes on it.
When she reached the table, she sat down heavily on it, as if absent-mindedly, and did not appear to notice at all that next to her coffee was pouring out onto the carpet in a full stream from the large overturned container.
"Mother, mother," said Gregor quietly, and looked over towards her.
The manager momentarily had disappeared completely from his mind.
At the sight of the flowing coffee Gregor couldn't stop himself snapping his jaws in the air a few times .
At that his mother screamed all over again, hurried from the table, and collapsed into the arms of his father, who was rushing towards her.
But Gregor had no time right now for his parents--the manager was already on the staircase.
His chin level with the banister, the manager looked back for the last time.
Gregor took an initial movement to catch up to him if possible.
But the manager must have suspected something, because he made a leap down over a few stairs and disappeared, still shouting "Huh!"
The sound echoed throughout the entire stairwell.
Now, unfortunately this flight of the manager also seemed to bewilder his father completely.
Earlier he had been relatively calm, for instead of running after the manager himself or at least not hindering Gregor from his pursuit, with his right hand he grabbed hold of the manager's cane, which he had left behind with his hat and overcoat on a chair.
With his left hand, his father picked up a large newspaper from the table and, stamping his feet on the floor, he set out to drive Gregor back into his room by waving the cane and the newspaper.
No request of Gregor's was of any use; no request would even be understood.
No matter how willing he was to turn his head respectfully, his father just stomped all the harder with his feet.
Across the room from him his mother had pulled open a window, in spite of the cool weather, and leaning out with her hands on her cheeks, she pushed her face far outside the window.
Between the alley and the stairwell a strong draught came up, the curtains on the window flew around, the newspapers on the table swished, and individual sheets fluttered down over the floor.
The father relentlessly pressed forward, pushing out sibilants, like a wild man.
Now, Gregor had no practice at all in going backwards--it was really very slow going.
If Gregor only had been allowed to turn himself around, he would have been in his room right away, but he was afraid to make his father impatient by the time-consuming process of turning around, and each moment he faced the threat of a mortal blow on his back or his head from the cane in his father's hand.
Finally Gregor had no other option, for he noticed with horror that he did not understand yet how to maintain his direction going backwards.
And so he began, amid constantly anxious sideways glances in his father's direction, to turn himself around as quickly as possible, although in truth this was only done very slowly.
Perhaps his father noticed his good intentions, for he did not disrupt Gregor in this motion, but with the tip of the cane from a distance he even directed
Gregor's rotating movement here and there.
If only his father had not hissed so unbearably!
Because of that Gregor totally lost his head.
He was already almost totally turned around, when, always with this hissing in his ear, he just made a mistake and turned himself back a little.
But when he finally was successful in getting his head in front of the door opening, it became clear that his body was too wide to go through any further.
Naturally his father, in his present mental state, had no idea of opening the other wing of the door a bit to create a suitable passage for Gregor to get through.
His single fixed thought was that Gregor must get into his room as quickly as possible.
He would never have allowed the elaborate preparations that Gregor required to orient himself and thus perhaps get through the door.
On the contrary, as if there were no obstacle and with a peculiar noise, he now drove Gregor forwards.
Behind Gregor the sound at this point was no longer like the voice of only a single father.
Now it was really no longer a joke, and Gregor forced himself, come what might, into the door.
One side of his body was lifted up.
He lay at an angle in the door opening.
His one flank was sore with the scraping.
On the white door ugly blotches were left.
Soon he was stuck fast and would have not been able to move any more on his own.
The tiny legs on one side hung twitching in the air above, and the ones on the other side were pushed painfully into the floor.
Then his father gave him one really strong liberating push from behind, and he scurried, bleeding severely, far into the interior of his room.
The door was slammed shut with the cane, and finally it was quiet.
CHAPTER Il.
Gregor first woke up from his heavy swoon- like sleep in the evening twilight.
He would certainly have woken up soon afterwards without any disturbance, for he felt himself sufficiently rested and wide awake, although it appeared to him as if a hurried step and a cautious closing of the door to the hall had aroused him.
Light from the electric streetlamps lay pale here and there on the ceiling and on the higher parts of the furniture, but underneath around Gregor it was dark.
He pushed himself slowly toward the door, still groping awkwardly with his feelers, which he now learned to value for the first time, to check what was happening there.
His left side seemed one single long unpleasantly stretched scar, and he really had to hobble on his two rows of legs.
In addition, one small leg had been seriously wounded in the course of the morning incident--it was almost a miracle that only one had been hurt--and dragged
lifelessly behind.
By the door he first noticed what had really lured him there: it was the smell of something to eat.
A bowl stood there, filled with sweetened milk, in which swam tiny pieces of white bread.
He almost laughed with joy, for he now had a much greater hunger than in the morning, and he immediately dipped his head almost up to and over his eyes down into the milk.
But he soon drew it back again in disappointment, not just because it was difficult for him to eat on account of his delicate left side--he could eat only if his entire panting body worked in a coordinated way--but also because the milk, which otherwise was his favourite drink and which his sister had certainly placed there for that reason, did not appeal to him at all.
He turned away from the bowl almost with aversion and crept back into the middle of the room.
In the living room, as Gregor saw through the crack in the door, the gas was lit, but where, on other occasions at this time of day, his father was accustomed to read the afternoon newspaper in a loud voice to his mother and sometimes also to his sister, at the moment no sound was audible.
Now, perhaps this reading aloud, about which his sister had always spoken and written to him, had recently fallen out of their general routine.
But it was so still all around, in spite of the fact that the apartment was certainly not empty.
"What a quiet life the family leads," said Gregor to himself and, as he stared fixedly out in front of him into the darkness, he felt a great pride that he had been able to provide such a life in a beautiful apartment like this for his parents and his sister.
But how would things go if now all tranquillity, all prosperity, all contentment should come to a horrible end?
In order not to lose himself in such thoughts, Gregor preferred to set himself moving, so he moved up and down in his room.
Once during the long evening one side door and then the other door was opened just a tiny crack and quickly closed again.
Someone presumably needed to come in but had then thought better of it.
Gregor immediately took up a position by the living room door, determined to bring in the hesitant visitor somehow or other or at least to find out who it might be.
But now the door was not opened any more, and Gregor waited in vain.
Earlier, when the door had been barred, they had all wanted to come in to him; now, when he had opened one door and when the others had obviously been opened during the day, no one came any more, and the keys were stuck in the locks on the outside.
The light in the living room was turned off only late at night, and now it was easy to establish that his parents and his sister had stayed awake all this time, for one could hear clearly as all three moved away on tiptoe.
Now it was certain that no one would come into Gregor any more until the morning.
Thus, he had a long time to think undisturbed about how he should reorganize his life from scratch.
But the high, open room, in which he was compelled to lie flat on the floor, made him anxious, without his being able to figure out the reason, for he had lived in the room for five years.
With a half unconscious turn and not without a slight shame he scurried under the couch, where, in spite of the fact that his back was a little cramped and he could no longer lift up his head, he felt very comfortable and was sorry only that his body was too wide to fit completely under it.
There he remained the entire night, which he spent partly in a state of semi-sleep, out of which his hunger constantly woke him with a start, but partly in a state of worry and murky hopes, which all led to the conclusion that for the time being he would have to keep calm and with patience and the greatest consideration for his family tolerate the troubles which in his present condition he was now forced to cause them.
Already early in the morning--it was still almost night--Gregor had an opportunity to test the power of the decisions he had just made, for his sister, almost fully dressed, opened the door from the hall into his room and looked eagerly inside.
She did not find him immediately, but when she noticed him under the couch--God, he had to be somewhere or other, for he could hardly fly away--she got such a shock that, without being able to control herself, she slammed the door shut once again from the outside.
However, as if she was sorry for her behaviour, she immediately opened the door again and walked in on her tiptoes, as if she was in the presence of a serious invalid or a total stranger.
Gregor had pushed his head forward just to the edge of the couch and was observing her.
Would she really notice that he had left the milk standing, not indeed from any lack of hunger, and would she bring in something else to eat more suitable for him?
If she did not do it on her own, he would sooner starve to death than call her attention to the fact, although he had a really powerful urge to move beyond the couch, throw himself at his sister's feet, and beg her for something or other good to eat.
But his sister noticed right away with astonishment that the bowl was still full, with only a little milk spilled around it.
She picked it up immediately, although not with her bare hands but with a rag, and took it out of the room.
Gregor was extremely curious what she would bring as a substitute, and he pictured to himself different ideas about it.
But he never could have guessed what his sister out of the goodness of her heart in fact did.
She brought him, to test his taste, an entire selection, all spread out on an old newspaper.
There were old half-rotten vegetables, bones from the evening meal, covered with a white sauce which had almost solidified, some raisins and almonds, cheese which
Gregor had declared inedible two days earlier, a slice of dry bread, and a slice of salted bread smeared with butter.
In addition to all this, she put down a bowl--probably designated once and for all as Gregor's--into which she had poured some water.
And out of her delicacy of feeling, since she knew that Gregor would not eat in front of her, she went away very quickly and even turned the key in the lock, so that Gregor would now observe that he could make himself as comfortable as he wished.
Gregor's small limbs buzzed now that the time for eating had come.
His wounds must, in any case, have already healed completely.
He felt no handicap on that score.
He was astonished at that and thought about how more than a month ago he had cut his finger slightly with a knife and how this wound had hurt enough even the day before yesterday.
"Am I now going to be less sensitive," he thought, already sucking greedily on the cheese, which had strongly attracted him right away, more than all the other foods.
Quickly and with his eyes watering with satisfaction, he ate one after the other the cheese, the vegetables, and the sauce.
The fresh food, by contrast, didn't taste good to him.
He couldn't bear the smell and even carried the things he wanted to eat a little distance away.
By the time his sister slowly turned the key as a sign that he should withdraw, he was long finished and now lay lazily in the same spot.
The noise immediately startled him, in spite of the fact that he was already almost asleep, and he scurried back again under the couch.
But it cost him great self-control to remain under the couch, even for the short time his sister was in the room, because his body had filled out somewhat on account of the rich meal and in the narrow space there he could scarcely breathe.
In the midst of minor attacks of asphyxiation, he looked at her with somewhat protruding eyes, as his unsuspecting sister swept up with a broom, not just the remnants, but even the foods which Gregor had not touched at all, as if these were also now useless, and as she dumped everything quickly into a bucket, which she closed with a wooden lid, and then carried all of it out of the room.
She had hardly turned around before Gregor had already dragged himself out from the couch, stretched out, and let his body expand.
In this way Gregor got his food every day, once in the morning, when his parents and the servant girl were still asleep, and a second time after the common noon meal, for his parents were, as before, asleep then for a little while, and the servant girl was sent off by his sister on some errand or other.
They certainly would not have wanted Gregor to starve to death, but perhaps they could not have endured finding out what he ate other than by hearsay.
Perhaps his sister wanted to spare them what was possibly only a small grief, for they were really suffering quite enough already.
What sorts of excuses people had used on that first morning to get the doctor and the locksmith out of the house Gregor was completely unable to ascertain.
Since they could not understand him, no one, not even his sister, thought that he might be able to understand others, and thus, when his sister was in her room, he had to be content with listening now and then to her sighs and invocations to the saints.
Only later, when she had grown somewhat accustomed to everything--naturally there could never be any talk of her growing completely accustomed to it--Gregor sometimes caught a comment which was intended to be friendly or could be interpreted as such.
"Well, today it tasted good to him," she said, if Gregor had really cleaned up what he had to eat; whereas, in the reverse situation, which gradually repeated itself more and more frequently, she used to say sadly, "Now everything has stopped again."
But while Gregor could get no new information directly, he did hear a good deal from the room next door, and as soon as he heard voices, he scurried right away to the appropriate door and pressed his entire body against it.
In the early days especially, there was no conversation which was not concerned with him in some way or other, even if only in secret.
For two days at all meal times discussions on that subject could be heard on how people should now behave; but they also talked about the same subject in the times between meals, for there were always at least two family members at home, since no one really wanted to remain in the house alone and people could not under any circumstances leave the apartment completely empty.
In addition, on the very first day the servant girl--it was not completely clear what and how much she knew about what had happened--on her knees had begged his mother to let her go immediately, and when she said good bye about fifteen minutes later, she thanked them for the dismissal with tears in her eyes, as if she was receiving the greatest favour which people had shown her there, and, without anyone demanding it from her, she swore a fearful oath not to betray anyone, not even the slightest bit.
Now his sister had to team up with his mother to do the cooking, although that didn't create much trouble because people were eating almost nothing.
Again and again Gregor listened as one of them vainly invited another one to eat and received no answer other than "Thank you.
I've had enough" or something like that.
And perhaps they had stopped having anything to drink, too.
His sister often asked his father whether he wanted to have a beer and gladly offered to fetch it herself, and when his father was silent, she said, in order to remove any reservations he might have, that she could send the caretaker's wife to get it.
But then his father finally said a resounding "No," and nothing more would be spoken about it.
Already during the first day his father laid out all the financial circumstances and prospects to his mother and to his sister as well.
From time to time he stood up from the table and pulled out of the small lockbox salvaged from his business, which had collapsed five years previously, some document or other or some notebook.
The sound was audible as he opened up the complicated lock and, after removing what he was looking for, locked it up again.
These explanations by his father were, in part, the first enjoyable thing that Gregor had the chance to listen to since his imprisonment.
He had thought that nothing at all was left over for his father from that business; at least his father had told him nothing to contradict that view, and Gregor in any case hadn't asked him about it.
At the time Gregor's only concern had been to use everything he had in order to allow his family to forget as quickly as possible the business misfortune which had brought them all into a state of complete hopelessness.
And so at that point he'd started to work with a special intensity and from an assistant had become, almost overnight, a travelling salesman, who naturally had entirely different possibilities for earning money and whose successes at work were converted immediately into the form of cash commissions, which could be set out on the table at home in front of his astonished and delighted family.
Those had been beautiful days, and they had never come back afterwards, at least not with the same splendour, in spite of the fact that Gregor later earned so much money that he was in a position to bear the expenses of the entire family, costs which he, in fact, did bear.
They had become quite accustomed to it, both the family and Gregor as well.
They took the money with thanks, and he happily surrendered it, but the special warmth was no longer present.
Only the sister had remained still close to Gregor, and it was his secret plan to send her next year to the conservatory, regardless of the great expense which that necessarily involved and which would be made up in other ways.
In contrast to Gregor she loved music very much and knew how to play the violin charmingly.
Now and then during Gregor's short stays in the city the conservatory was mentioned in conversations with his sister, but always only as a beautiful dream, whose realization was unimaginable, and their parents never listened to these innocent expectations with pleasure.
But Gregor thought about them with scrupulous consideration and intended to explain the matter ceremoniously on Christmas Eve.
In his present situation, such futile ideas went through his head, while he pushed himself right up against the door and listened.
Sometimes in his general exhaustion he couldn't listen any more and let his head bang listlessly against the door, but he immediately pulled himself together, for even the small sound which he made by this motion was heard near by and silenced everyone.
"There he goes on again," said his father after a while, clearly turning towards the door, and only then would the interrupted conversation gradually be resumed again.
Gregor found out clearly enough--for his father tended to repeat himself often in his explanations, partly because he had not personally concerned himself with these matters for a long time now, and partly also because his mother did not understand everything right away the first time--that, in spite all bad luck, a fortune, although a very small one, was available from the old times, which the interest, which had not been touched, had in the intervening time gradually allowed to increase a
Furthermore, in addition to this, the money which Gregor had brought home every month-- he had kept only a few florins for himself- -had not been completely spent and had grown into a small capital amount.
Gregor, behind his door, nodded eagerly, rejoicing over this unanticipated foresight and frugality.
True, with this excess money, he could have paid off more of his father's debt to his employer and the day on which he could be rid of this position would have been a lot closer, but now things were doubtless better the way his father had arranged them.
At the moment, however, this money was not nearly sufficient to permit the family to
live on the interest payments.
Perhaps it would be enough to maintain the family for one or at most two years, that's all.
Thus, it only added up to an amount which one should not really draw upon and which must be set aside for an emergency.
But the money to live on had to be earned.
Now, although his father was old, he was a healthy man who had not worked at all for five years and thus could not be counted on for very much.
He had in these five years, the first holidays of his trouble-filled but unsuccessful life, put on a good deal of fat and thus had become really heavy.
And should his old mother now perhaps work for money, a woman who suffered from asthma, for whom wandering through the apartment even now was a great strain and who spent every second day on the sofa by the open window labouring for breath?
Should his sister earn money, a girl who was still a seventeen-year-old child whose earlier life style had been so very delightful that it had consisted of dressing herself nicely, sleeping in late, helping around the house, taking part in a few modest enjoyments and, above all, playing the violin?
When it came to talking about this need to earn money, at first Gregor went away from the door and threw himself on the cool leather sofa beside the door, for he was quite hot from shame and sorrow.
Often he lay there all night long.
He didn't sleep a moment and just scratched on the leather for hours at a time.
He undertook the very difficult task of shoving a chair over to the window.
Then he crept up on the window sill and, braced in the chair, leaned against the window to look out, obviously with some memory or other of the satisfaction which that used to bring him in earlier times.
Actually, from day to day he perceived things with less and less clarity, even those a short distance away: the hospital across the street, the all-too-frequent sight of which he had previously cursed, was not visible at all any more, and if he had not been precisely aware that he lived in the quiet but completely urban Charlotte Street, he could have believed that from his window he was peering out at a featureless wasteland, in which the grey heaven and the grey earth had merged and were indistinguishable.
His attentive sister must have observed a couple of times that the chair stood by the window; then, after cleaning up the room, each time she pushed the chair back right against the window and from now on she even left the inner casement open.
If Gregor had only been able to speak to his sister and thank her for everything that she had to do for him, he would have tolerated her service more easily.
As it was, he suffered under it.
The sister admittedly sought to cover up the awkwardness of everything as much as possible, and, as time went by, she naturally got more successful at it.
But with the passing of time Gregor also came to understand everything more precisely.
Even her entrance was terrible for him.
As soon as she entered, she ran straight to the window, without taking the time to shut the door, in spite of the fact that she was otherwise very considerate in sparing anyone the sight of Gregor's room, and yanked the window open with eager hands, as if she was almost suffocating, and remained for a while by the window breathing deeply, even when it was still so cold.
With this running and noise she frightened Gregor twice every day.
The entire time he trembled under the couch, and yet he knew very well that she would certainly have spared him gladly if it had only been possible to remain with the window closed in a room where Gregor lived.
On one occasion--about one month had already gone by since Gregor's transformation, and there was now no particular reason any more for his sister to be startled at Gregor's appearance--she arrived a little earlier than usual and came upon Gregor as he was still looking out the window, immobile and well positioned to frighten someone.
It would not have come as a surprise to Gregor if she had not come in, since his position was preventing her from opening the window immediately.
But she not only did not step inside; she even retreated and shut the door.
A stranger really might have concluded from this that Gregor had been lying in wait for her and wanted to bite her.
Of course, Gregor immediately concealed himself under the couch, but he had to wait until the noon meal before his sister returned, and she seemed much less calm than usual.
From this he realized that his appearance was still constantly intolerable to her and must remain intolerable in future, and that she really had to exert a lot of self- control not to run away from a glimpse of only the small part of his body which stuck out from under the couch.
In order to spare her even this sight, one day he dragged the sheet on his back and onto the couch--this task took him four hours--and arranged it in such a way that he was now completely concealed and his sister, even if she bent down, could not see him.
If this sheet was not necessary as far as she was concerned, then she could remove it, for it was clear enough that Gregor could not derive any pleasure from isolating himself away so completely.
But she left the sheet just as it was, and Gregor believed he even caught a look of gratitude when, on one occasion, he carefully lifted up the sheet a little with his head to check, as his sister took stock of the new arrangement.
In the first two weeks his parents could not bring themselves to visit him, and he often heard how they fully acknowledged his sister's present work; whereas, earlier they had often got annoyed at his sister because she had seemed to them a somewhat useless young woman.
However, now both his father and his mother often waited in front of Gregor's door while his sister cleaned up inside, and as soon as she came out, she had to explain in detail how things looked in the room, what
Gregor had eaten, how he had behaved this time, and whether perhaps a slight improvement was perceptible.
In any event, his mother comparatively soon wanted to visit Gregor, but his father and his sister restrained her, at first with reasons which Gregor listened to very attentively and which he completely endorsed.
Later, however, they had to hold her back forcefully, and when she then cried "Let me go to Gregor.
Don't you understand that I have to go to him?"
Gregor then thought that perhaps it would be a good thing if his mother came in, not every day, of course, but maybe once a week.
She understood everything much better than his sister, who, in spite of all her courage, was still a child and, in the last analysis, had perhaps undertaken such a difficult task only out of childish recklessness.
Gregor's wish to see his mother was soon realized.
While during the day Gregor, out of consideration for his parents, did not want to show himself by the window, he couldn't crawl around very much on the few square metres of the floor.
He found it difficult to bear lying quietly during the night, and soon eating no longer gave him the slightest pleasure.
So for diversion he acquired the habit of crawling back and forth across the walls and ceiling.
He was especially fond of hanging from the ceiling.
The experience was quite different from lying on the floor.
It was easier to breathe, a slight vibration went through his body, and in the midst of the almost happy amusement which Gregor found up there, it could happen that, to his own surprise, he let go and hit the floor.
However, now he naturally controlled his body quite differently, and he did not injure himself in such a great fall.
His sister noticed immediately the new amusement which Gregor had found for himself--for as he crept around he left behind here and there traces of his sticky stuff--and so she got the idea of making
Gregor's creeping around as easy as possible and thus of removing the furniture which got in the way, especially the chest of drawers and the writing desk.
But she was in no position to do this by herself.
She did not dare to ask her father to help, and the servant girl would certainly not have assisted her, for although this girl, about sixteen years old, had courageously remained since the dismissal of the previous cook, she had begged for the privilege of being allowed to stay permanently confined to the kitchen and of having to open the door only in answer to a special summons.
Thus, his sister had no other choice but to involve his mother while his father was absent.
His mother approached Gregor's room with cries of excited joy, but she fell silent at the door.
Of course, his sister first checked whether everything in the room was in order.
Only then did she let his mother walk in. In great haste Gregor had drawn the sheet down even further and wrinkled it more.
The whole thing really looked just like a coverlet thrown carelessly over the couch.
On this occasion, Gregor held back from spying out from under the sheet.
Thus, he refrained from looking at his mother this time and was just happy that she had come.
"Come on; he's not visible," said his sister, and evidently led his mother by the hand.
Now Gregor listened as these two weak women shifted the still heavy old chest of drawers from its position, and as his sister constantly took on herself the greater part of the work, without listening to the warnings of his mother, who was afraid that she would strain herself.
The work lasted a long time.
After about a quarter of an hour had already gone by, his mother said it would be better if they left the chest of drawers where it was, because, in the first place, it was too heavy: they would not be finished before his father's arrival, and leaving the chest of drawers in the middle of the room would block all Gregor's pathways, but, in the second place, they could not be certain that Gregor would be pleased with the removal of the furniture.
To her the reverse seemed to be true; the sight of the empty walls pierced her right to the heart, and why should Gregor not feel the same, since he had been accustomed to the room furnishings for a long time and in an empty room would feel himself abandoned?
"And is it not the case," his mother concluded very quietly, almost whispering as if she wished to prevent Gregor, whose exact location she really didn't know, from hearing even the sound of her voice--for she was convinced that he did not understand her words--"and isn't it a fact that by removing the furniture we're showing that we're giving up all hope of an improvement and are leaving him to his own resources without any consideration?
I think it would be best if we tried to keep the room exactly in the condition it was in before, so that, when Gregor returns to us, he finds everything unchanged and can forget the intervening time all the more easily."
As he heard his mother's words Gregor realized that the lack of all immediate human contact, together with the monotonous life surrounded by the family over the course of these two months, must have confused his understanding, because otherwise he couldn't explain to himself how he, in all seriousness, could have been so keen to have his room emptied.
Was he really eager to let the warm room, comfortably furnished with pieces he had inherited, be turned into a cavern in which he would, of course, then be able to crawl about in all directions without disturbance, but at the same time with a quick and complete forgetting of his human past as well?
Was he then at this point already on the verge of forgetting and was it only the voice of his mother, which he had not heard for a long time, that had aroused him?
Nothing was to be removed--everything must remain.
In his condition he could not function without the beneficial influences of his furniture.
And if the furniture prevented him from carrying out his senseless crawling about all over the place, then there was no harm in that, but rather a great benefit.
But his sister unfortunately thought otherwise.
She had grown accustomed, certainly not without justification, so far as the discussion of matters concerning Gregor was concerned, to act as an special expert with respect to their parents, and so now the mother's advice was for his sister sufficient reason to insist on the removal, not only of the chest of drawers and the writing desk, which were the only items she had thought about at first, but also of all the furniture, with the exception of the indispensable couch.
Of course, it was not only childish defiance and her recent very unexpected and hard won self-confidence which led her to this demand.
She had also actually observed that Gregor needed a great deal of room to creep about; the furniture, on the other hand, as far as one could see, was not of the slightest use.
But perhaps the enthusiastic sensibility of young women of her age also played a role.
This feeling sought release at every opportunity, and with it Grete now felt tempted to want to make Gregor's situation even more terrifying, so that then she would be able to do even more for him than now.
For surely no one except Grete would ever trust themselves to enter a room in which
Gregor ruled the empty walls all by himself.
And so she did not let herself be dissuaded from her decision by her mother, who in this room seemed uncertain of herself in her sheer agitation and soon kept quiet, helping his sister with all her energy to get the chest of drawers out of the room.
Now, Gregor could still do without the chest of drawers if need be, but the writing desk really had to stay.
And scarcely had the women left the room with the chest of drawers, groaning as they pushed it, when Gregor stuck his head out from under the sofa to take a look how he could intervene cautiously and with as much consideration as possible.
But unfortunately it was his mother who came back into the room first, while Grete had her arms wrapped around the chest of drawers in the next room and was rocking it back and forth by herself, without moving it from its position.
His mother was not used to the sight of Gregor; he could have made her ill, and so, frightened, Gregor scurried backwards right to the other end of the sofa, but he could no longer prevent the sheet from moving forward a little.
That was enough to catch his mother's attention.
She came to a halt, stood still for a moment, and then went back to Grete.
Although Gregor kept repeating to himself over and over that really nothing unusual was going on, that only a few pieces of furniture were being rearranged, he soon had to admit to himself that the movements of the women to and fro, their quiet conversations, and the scratching of the furniture on the floor affected him like a great swollen commotion on all sides, and, so firmly was he pulling in his head and legs and pressing his body into the floor, he had to tell himself unequivocally that he wouldn't be able to endure all this much longer.
They were cleaning out his room, taking away from him everything he cherished; they had already dragged out the chest of drawers in which the fret saw and other tools were kept, and they were now
loosening the writing desk which was fixed tight to the floor, the desk on which he, as a business student, a school student, indeed even as an elementary school student, had written out his assignments.
At that moment he really didn't have any more time to check the good intentions of the two women, whose existence he had in any case almost forgotten, because in their exhaustion they were working really silently, and the heavy stumbling of their feet was the only sound to be heard.
And so he scuttled out--the women were just propping themselves up on the writing desk in the next room in order to take a breather--changing the direction of his path four times.
He really didn't know what he should rescue first.
Then he saw hanging conspicuously on the wall, which was otherwise already empty, the picture of the woman dressed in nothing but fur.
He quickly scurried up over it and pressed himself against the glass which held it in place and which made his hot abdomen feel good.
At least this picture, which Gregor at the moment completely concealed, surely no one would now take away.
He twisted his head towards the door of the living room to observe the women as they came back in. They had not allowed themselves very much rest and were coming back right away.
Grete had placed her arm around her mother and held her tightly.
"So what shall we take now?" said Grete and looked around her.
Then her glance met Gregor's from the wall.
She kept her composure only because her mother was there.
She bent her face towards her mother in order to prevent her from looking around, and said, although in a trembling voice and too quickly, "Come, wouldn't it be better to go back to the living room for just another moment?"
Grete's purpose was clear to Gregor: she wanted to bring his mother to a safe place and then chase him down from the wall.
Well, let her just try!
He squatted on his picture and did not hand it over. He would sooner spring into Grete's face.
But Grete's words had immediately made the mother very uneasy.
She walked to the side, caught sight of the enormous brown splotch on the flowered wallpaper, and, before she became truly aware that what she was looking at was
Gregor, screamed out in a high pitched raw voice "Oh God, oh God" and fell with outstretched arms, as if she was surrendering everything, down onto the couch and lay there motionless.
"Gregor, you. . ." cried out his sister with a raised fist and an urgent glare.
Since his transformation these were the first words which she had directed right at him.
She ran into the room next door to bring some spirits or other with which she could revive her mother from her fainting spell.
Gregor wanted to help as well--there was time enough to save the picture--but he was stuck fast on the glass and had to tear himself loose forcefully.
Then he also scurried into the next room, as if he could give his sister some advice, as in earlier times, but then he had to stand there idly behind her, while she rummaged about among various small bottles.
Still, she was frightened when she turned around.
A bottle fell onto the floor and shattered.
A splinter of glass wounded Gregor in the face, some corrosive medicine or other dripped over him.
Now, without lingering any longer, Grete took as many small bottles as she could hold and ran with them into her mother.
She slammed the door shut with her foot.
Gregor was now shut off from his mother, who was perhaps near death, thanks to him.
He could not open the door, and he did not want to chase away his sister who had to remain with her mother.
At this point he had nothing to do but wait, and overwhelmed with self-reproach and worry, he began to creep and crawl over everything: walls, furniture, and ceiling.
Finally, in his despair, as the entire room started to spin around him, he fell onto the middle of the large table.
A short time elapsed.
Gregor lay there limply.
All around was still.
Perhaps that was a good sign.
Then there was ring at the door.
The servant girl was naturally shut up in her kitchen, and therefore Grete had to go to open the door.
The father had arrived.
"What's happened?" were his first words.
Grete's appearance had told him everything.
Grete replied with a dull voice; evidently she was pressing her face into her father's chest:
"Mother fainted, but she's getting better now.
Gregor has broken loose." "Yes, I have expected that," said his father, "I always told you that, but you women don't want to listen."
It was clear to Gregor that his father had badly misunderstood Grete's short message and was assuming that Gregor had committed some violent crime or other.
Thus, Gregor now had to find his father to calm him down, for he had neither the time nor the ability to explain things to him.
And so he rushed away to the door of his room and pushed himself against it, so that his father could see right away as he entered from the hall that Gregor fully intended to return at once to his room, that it was not necessary to drive him back, but that one only needed to open the door, and he would disappear immediately.
But his father was not in the mood to observe such niceties.
"Ah," he yelled as soon as he entered, with a tone as if he were all at once angry and pleased.
Gregor pulled his head back from the door and raised it in the direction of his father.
He had not really pictured his father as he now stood there.
Of course, what with his new style of creeping all around, he had in the past while neglected to pay attention to what was going on in the rest of the apartment, as he had done before, and really should have grasped the fact that he would encounter different conditions.
Nevertheless, nevertheless, was that still his father?
Was that the same man who had lain exhausted and buried in bed in earlier days when Gregor was setting out on a business trip, who had received him on the evenings of his return in a sleeping gown and arm chair, totally incapable of standing up, who had only lifted his arm as a sign of happiness, and who in their rare strolls together a few Sundays a year and on the important holidays made his way slowly forwards between Gregor and his mother--who themselves moved slowly--always a bit more slowly than them, bundled up in his old coat, all the time setting down his walking stick carefully, and who, when he had wanted to say something, almost always stood still and gathered his entourage around him?
But now he was standing up really straight, dressed in a tight-fitting blue uniform with gold buttons, like the ones servants wear in a banking company.
Above the high stiff collar of his jacket his firm double chin stuck out prominently, beneath his bushy eyebrows the glance of his black eyes was freshly penetrating and alert, his otherwise dishevelled white hair was combed down into a carefully exact shining part.
He threw his cap, on which a gold monogram, apparently the symbol of the bank, was affixed, in an arc across the entire room onto the sofa and moved, throwing back the edge of the long coat of his uniform, with his hands in his trouser pockets and a grim face, right up to Gregor.
He really didn't know what he had in mind, but he raised his foot uncommonly high anyway, and Gregor was astonished at the gigantic size of the sole of his boot.
However, he did not linger on that point.
For he knew from the first day of his new life that, as far as he was concerned, his father considered the greatest force the only appropriate response.
And so he scurried away from his father, stopped when his father remained standing, and scampered forward again when his father merely stirred.
In this way they made their way around the room repeatedly, without anything decisive taking place.
In fact, because of the slow pace, it didn't look like a chase.
Gregor remained on the floor for the time being, especially since he was afraid that his father could take a flight up onto the wall or the ceiling as an act of real malice.
At any event, Gregor had to tell himself that he couldn't keep up this running around for a long time, because whenever his father took a single step, he had to go through an enormous number of movements.
Already he was starting to suffer from a shortage of breath, just as in his earlier days when his lungs had been quite unreliable.
As he now staggered around in this way in order to gather all his energies for running, hardly keeping his eyes open and feeling so listless that he had no notion at all of any escape other than by running and had almost already forgotten that the walls were available to him, although they were obstructed by carefully carved furniture full of sharp points and spikes, at that moment something or other thrown casually flew down close by and rolled in front of him.
It was an apple.
Immediately a second one flew after it.
Gregor stood still in fright.
Further running away was useless, for his father had decided to bombard him.
From the fruit bowl on the sideboard his father had filled his pockets.
And now, without for the moment taking accurate aim, he was throwing apple after apple.
These small red apples rolled around on the floor, as if electrified, and collided with each other.
A weakly thrown apple grazed Gregor's back but skidded off harmlessly.
However, another thrown immediately after that one drove into Gregor's back really hard.
Gregor wanted to drag himself off, as if the unexpected and incredible pain would go away if he changed his position.
But he felt as if he was nailed in place and lay stretched out completely confused in all his senses.
Only with his final glance did he notice how the door of his room was pulled open and how, right in front of his sister--who was yelling--his mother ran out in her undergarments, for his sister had undressed her in order to give her some freedom to breathe in her fainting spell, and how his mother then ran up to his father, on the way her tied up skirts slipped toward the floor one after the other, and how, tripping over her skirts, she hurled herself onto his father and, throwing her arms around him, in complete union with him--but at this moment Gregor's powers of sight gave way--as her hands reached to the back of his father's head and she begged him to spare Gregor's life.
CHAPTER ill.
Gregor's serious wound, from which he suffered for over a month--since no one ventured to remove the apple, it remained in his flesh as a visible reminder--seemed by itself to have reminded the father that, in spite of his present unhappy and hateful appearance, Gregor was a member of the family, something one should not treat as an enemy, and that it was, on the contrary, a requirement of family duty to suppress one's aversion and to endure--nothing else, just endure.
And if through his wound Gregor had now apparently lost for good his ability to move and for the time being needed many, many minutes to crawl across his room, like an aged invalid--so far as creeping up high was concerned, that was unimaginable-- nevertheless for this worsening of his condition, in his opinion, he did get completely satisfactory compensation, because every day towards evening the door to the living room, which he was in the habit of keeping a sharp eye on even one or two hours beforehand, was opened, so that he, lying down in the darkness of his room, invisible from the living room, could see the entire family at the illuminated table and listen to their conversation, to a certain extent with their common permission, a situation quite different from what had happened before.
Of course, it was no longer the animated social interaction of former times, which
Gregor in small hotel rooms had always thought about with a certain longing, when, tired out, he had had to throw himself into the damp bedclothes.
For the most part what went on now was very quiet.
After the evening meal, the father fell asleep quickly in his arm chair.
The mother and sister talked guardedly to each other in the stillness.
Bent far over, the mother sewed fine undergarments for a fashion shop.
The sister, who had taken on a job as a salesgirl, in the evening studied stenography and French, so as perhaps later to obtain a better position.
Sometimes the father woke up and, as if he was quite ignorant that he had been asleep, said to the mother "How long you have been sewing today?" and went right back to sleep, while the mother and the sister smiled tiredly to each other.
With a sort of stubbornness the father refused to take off his servant's uniform even at home, and while his sleeping gown hung unused on the coat hook, the father dozed completely dressed in his place, as if he was always ready for his responsibility and even here was waiting for the voice of his superior.
As a result, in spite of all the care of the mother and sister, his uniform, which even at the start was not new, grew dirty, and Gregor looked, often for the entire evening, at this clothing, with stains all over it and with its gold buttons always polished, in which the old man, although very uncomfortable, slept peacefully nonetheless.
As soon as the clock struck ten, the mother tried gently encouraging the father to wake up and then persuading him to go to bed, on the ground that he couldn't get a proper sleep here and that the father, who had to report for service at six o'clock, really needed a good sleep.
But in his stubbornness, which had gripped him since he had become a servant, he insisted always on staying even longer by the table, although he regularly fell asleep and then could only be prevailed upon with the greatest difficulty to trade his chair for the bed.
No matter how much the mother and sister might at that point work on him with small admonitions, for a quarter of an hour he would remain shaking his head slowly, his eyes closed, without standing up.
The mother would pull him by the sleeve and speak flattering words into his ear; the sister would leave her work to help her mother, but that would not have the desired effect on the father.
He would settle himself even more deeply in his arm chair.
Only when the two women grabbed him under the armpits would he throw his eyes open, look back and forth at the mother and sister, and habitually say "This is a life.
This is the peace and quiet of my old age."
And propped up by both women, he would heave himself up elaborately, as if for him it was the greatest trouble, allow himself to be led to the door by the women, wave them away there, and proceed on his own from there, while the mother quickly threw down her sewing implements and the sister her pen in order to run after the father and help him some more.
In this overworked and exhausted family who had time to worry any longer about Gregor more than was absolutely necessary?
The household was constantly getting smaller.
The servant girl was now let go.
A huge bony cleaning woman with white hair flying all over her head came in the morning and evening to do the heaviest work.
The mother took care of everything else in addition to her considerable sewing work.
It even happened that various pieces of family jewellery, which previously the mother and sister had been overjoyed to wear on social and festive occasions, were sold, as Gregor found out in the evening from the general discussion of the prices they had fetched.
But the greatest complaint was always that they could not leave this apartment, which was too big for their present means, since it was impossible to imagine how Gregor might be moved.
But Gregor fully recognized that it was not just consideration for him which was preventing a move, for he could have been transported easily in a suitable box with a few air holes.
The main thing holding the family back from a change in living quarters was far more their complete hopelessness and the idea that they had been struck by a misfortune like no one else in their entire circle of relatives and acquaintances.
What the world demands of poor people they now carried out to an extreme degree.
The father bought breakfast to the petty officials at the bank, the mother sacrificed herself for the undergarments of strangers, the sister behind her desk was at the beck and call of customers, but the family's energies did not extend any further.
And the wound in his back began to pain Gregor all over again, when now mother and sister, after they had escorted the father to bed, came back, let their work lie, moved close together, and sat cheek to cheek and when his mother would now say, pointing to Gregor's room, "Close the door,
Grete," and when Gregor was again in the darkness, while close by the women mingled their tears or, quite dry eyed, stared at the table.
Gregor spent his nights and days with hardly any sleep.
Sometimes he thought that the next time the door opened he would take over the family arrangements just as he had earlier.
In his imagination appeared again, after a long time, his employer and supervisor and the apprentices, the excessively spineless custodian, two or three friends from other businesses, a chambermaid from a hotel in the provinces, a loving fleeting memory, a female cashier from a hat shop, whom he had seriously but too slowly courted--they all appeared mixed in with strangers or people he had already forgotten, but instead of helping him and his family, they were all unapproachable, and he was happy to see them disappear.
But then he was in no mood to worry about his family.
He was filled with sheer anger over the wretched care he was getting, even though he couldn't imagine anything which he might have an appetite for.
Still, he made plans about how he could take from the larder what he at all account deserved, even if he wasn't hungry.
Without thinking any more about how they might be able to give Gregor special pleasure, the sister now kicked some food or other very quickly into his room in the morning and at noon, before she ran off to her shop, and in the evening, quite indifferent to whether the food had perhaps only been tasted or, what happened most frequently, remained entirely undisturbed, she whisked it out with one sweep of her broom.
The task of cleaning his room, which she now always carried out in the evening, could not be done any more quickly.
Streaks of dirt ran along the walls; here and there lay tangles of dust and garbage.
At first, when his sister arrived, Gregor positioned himself in a particularly filthy corner in order with this posture to make something of a protest.
But he could have well stayed there for weeks without his sister's changing her ways.
In fact, she perceived the dirt as much as he did, but she had decided just to let it stay.
In this business, with a touchiness which was quite new to her and which had generally taken over the entire family, she kept watch to see that the cleaning of
Gregor's room remained reserved for her.
Once his mother had undertaken a major cleaning of Gregor's room, which she had only completed successfully after using a few buckets of water.
But the extensive dampness made Gregor sick and he lay supine, embittered and immobile on the couch.
However, the mother's punishment was not delayed for long.
For in the evening the sister had hardly observed the change in Gregor's room before she ran into the living room mightily offended and, in spite of her mother's hand
lifted high in entreaty, broke out in a fit of crying.
Her parents--the father had, of course, woken up with a start in his arm chair--at first looked at her astonished and helpless, until they started to get agitated.
Turning to his right, the father heaped reproaches on the mother that she was not to take over the cleaning of Gregor's room from the sister and, turning to his left, he shouted at the sister that she would no longer be allowed to clean Gregor's room ever again, while the mother tried to pull the father, beside himself in his excitement, into the bed room.
The sister, shaken by her crying fit, pounded on the table with her tiny fists, and Gregor hissed at all this, angry that no one thought about shutting the door and sparing him the sight of this commotion.
But even when the sister, exhausted from her daily work, had grown tired of caring for Gregor as she had before, even then the mother did not have to come at all on her behalf.
And Gregor did not have to be neglected.
For now the cleaning woman was there.
This old widow, who in her long life must have managed to survive the worst with the help of her bony frame, had no real horror of Gregor.
Without being in the least curious, she had once by chance opened Gregor's door.
At the sight of Gregor, who, totally surprised, began to scamper here and there, although no one was chasing him, she remained standing with her hands folded across her stomach staring at him.
Since then she did not fail to open the door furtively a little every morning and evening to look in on Gregor.
At first, she also called him to her with words which she presumably thought were friendly, like "Come here for a bit, old dung beetle!" or "Hey, look at the old dung beetle!"
Addressed in such a manner, Gregor answered nothing, but remained motionless in his place, as if the door had not been opened at all.
If only, instead of allowing this cleaning woman to disturb him uselessly whenever she felt like it, they had given her orders to clean up his room every day!
One day in the early morning--a hard downpour, perhaps already a sign of the coming spring, struck the window panes-- when the cleaning woman started up once again with her usual conversation, Gregor was so bitter that he turned towards her, as if for an attack, although slowly and weakly.
But instead of being afraid of him, the cleaning woman merely lifted up a chair standing close by the door and, as she stood there with her mouth wide open, her intention was clear: she would close her mouth only when the chair in her hand had been thrown down on Gregor's back.
"This goes no further, all right?" she asked, as Gregor turned himself around again, and she placed the chair calmly back in the corner.
Gregor ate hardly anything any more.
Only when he chanced to move past the food which had been prepared did he, as a game, take a bit into his mouth, hold it there for hours, and generally spit it out again.
At first he thought it might be his sadness over the condition of his room which kept him from eating, but he very soon became reconciled to the alterations in his room.
People had grown accustomed to put into storage in his room things which they couldn't put anywhere else, and at this point there were many such things, now that they had rented one room of the apartment to three lodgers.
These solemn gentlemen--all three had full beards, as Gregor once found out through a crack in the door--were meticulously intent on tidiness, not only in their own room but, since they had now rented a room here, in the entire household, and particularly in the kitchen.
They simply did not tolerate any useless or shoddy stuff.
Moreover, for the most part they had brought with them their own pieces of furniture.
Thus, many items had become superfluous, and these were not really things one could sell or things people wanted to throw out.
All these items ended up in Gregor's room, even the box of ashes and the garbage pail from the kitchen.
The cleaning woman, always in a hurry, simply flung anything that was momentarily useless into Gregor's room.
Fortunately Gregor generally saw only the relevant object and the hand which held it.
The cleaning woman perhaps was intending, when time and opportunity allowed, to take the stuff out again or to throw everything out all at once, but in fact the things remained lying there, wherever they had ended up at the first throw, unless Gregor squirmed his way through the accumulation of junk and moved it.
At first he was forced to do this because otherwise there was no room for him to creep around, but later he did it with a growing pleasure, although after such movements, tired to death and feeling wretched, he didn't budge for hours.
Because the lodgers sometimes also took their evening meal at home in the common living room, the door to the living room stayed shut on many evenings.
But Gregor had no trouble at all going without the open door.
Already on many evenings when it was open he had not availed himself of it, but, without the family noticing, was stretched out in the darkest corner of his room.
However, once the cleaning woman had left the door to the living room slightly ajar, and it remained open even when the lodgers came in in the evening and the lights were put on.
They sat down at the head of the table, where in earlier days the mother, the father, and Gregor had eaten, unfolded their serviettes, and picked up their knives and forks.
The mother immediately appeared in the door with a dish of meat and right behind her the sister with a dish piled high with potatoes.
The food gave off a lot of steam.
The gentlemen lodgers bent over the plate set before them, as if they wanted to check it before eating, and in fact the one who sat in the middle--for the other two he seemed to serve as the authority--cut off a piece of meat still on the plate obviously to establish whether it was sufficiently tender and whether or not something should be shipped back to the kitchen.
He was satisfied, and mother and sister, who had looked on in suspense, began to breathe easily and to smile.
The family itself ate in the kitchen.
In spite of that, before the father went into the kitchen, he came into the room and with a single bow, cap in hand, made a tour of the table.
The lodgers rose up collectively and murmured something in their beards.
Then, when they were alone, they ate almost in complete silence.
It seemed odd to Gregor that, out of all the many different sorts of sounds of eating, what was always audible was their chewing teeth, as if by that Gregor should be shown that people needed their teeth to eat and that nothing could be done even with the most handsome toothless jawbone.
"I really do have an appetite," Gregor said to himself sorrowfully, "but not for these things.
How these lodgers stuff themselves, and I am dying."
On this very evening the violin sounded from the kitchen.
Gregor didn't remember hearing it all through this period.
The lodgers had already ended their night meal, the middle one had pulled out a newspaper and had given each of the other two a page, and they were now leaning back, reading and smoking.
When the violin started playing, they became attentive, got up, and went on tiptoe to the hall door, at which they remained standing pressed up against one another.
They must have been audible from the kitchen, because the father called out
"Perhaps the gentlemen don't like the playing?
It can be stopped at once."
"On the contrary," stated the lodger in the middle, "might the young woman not come into us and play in the room here, where it is really much more comfortable and cheerful?"
"Oh, thank you," cried out the father, as if he were the one playing the violin.
The men stepped back into the room and waited.
Soon the father came with the music stand, the mother with the sheet music, and the sister with the violin.
The sister calmly prepared everything for the recital.
The parents, who had never previously rented a room and therefore exaggerated their politeness to the lodgers, dared not sit on their own chairs.
The father leaned against the door, his right hand stuck between two buttons of his buttoned-up uniform.
The mother, however, accepted a chair offered by one lodger.
Since she left the chair sit where the gentleman had chanced to put it, she sat to one side in a corner.
The sister began to play.
The father and mother, one on each side, followed attentively the movements of her hands.
Attracted by the playing, Gregor had ventured to advance a little further forward and his head was already in the living room.
He scarcely wondered about the fact that recently he had had so little consideration for the others.
Earlier this consideration had been something he was proud of.
And for that very reason he would have had at this moment more reason to hide away, because as a result of the dust which lay all over his room and flew around with the slightest movement, he was totally covered in dirt.
On his back and his sides he carted around with him dust, threads, hair, and remnants of food.
His indifference to everything was much too great for him to lie on his back and scour himself on the carpet, as he often had done earlier during the day.
In spite of his condition he had no timidity about inching forward a bit on the spotless floor of the living room.
In any case, no one paid him any attention.
The family was all caught up in the violin playing.
The lodgers, by contrast, who for the moment had placed themselves, hands in their trouser pockets, behind the music stand much too close to the sister, so that they could all see the sheet music, something that must certainly bother the sister, soon drew back to the window conversing in low voices with bowed heads, where they then remained, worriedly observed by the father.
It now seemed really clear that, having assumed they were to hear a beautiful or entertaining violin recital, they were disappointed and were allowing their peace and quiet to be disturbed only out of politeness.
The way in which they all blew the smoke from their cigars out of their noses and mouths in particular led one to conclude that they were very irritated.
And yet his sister was playing so beautifully.
Her face was turned to the side, her gaze followed the score intently and sadly.
Gregor crept forward still a little further, keeping his head close against the floor in order to be able to catch her gaze if possible.
Was he an animal that music so captivated him?
For him it was as if the way to the unknown nourishment he craved was revealing itself.
He was determined to press forward right to his sister, to tug at her dress, and to indicate to her in this way that she might still come with her violin into his room, because here no one valued the recital as he wanted to value it.
He did not wish to let her go from his room any more, at least not as long as he lived.
His frightening appearance would for the first time become useful for him.
He wanted to be at all the doors of his room simultaneously and snarl back at the attackers.
However, his sister should not be compelled but would remain with him voluntarily.
She would sit next to him on the sofa, bend down her ear to him, and he would then confide in her that he firmly intended to send her to the conservatory and that, if his misfortune had not arrived in the interim, he would have declared all this last Christmas--had Christmas really already come and gone?--and would have brooked no argument.
After this explanation his sister would break out in tears of emotion, and Gregor would lift himself up to her armpit and kiss her throat, which she, from the time she started going to work, had left exposed without a band or a collar.
"Mr. Samsa," called out the middle lodger to the father and, without uttering a further word, pointed his index finger at Gregor as he was moving slowly forward.
The violin fell silent.
The middle lodger smiled, first shaking his head once at his friends, and then looked down at Gregor once more.
Rather than driving Gregor back again, the father seemed to consider it of prime importance to calm down the lodgers, although they were not at all upset and
Gregor seemed to entertain them more than the violin recital.
The father hurried over to them and with outstretched arms tried to push them into their own room and simultaneously to block their view of Gregor with his own body.
At this point they became really somewhat irritated, although one no longer knew whether that was because of the father's behaviour or because of knowledge they had just acquired that they had, without knowing it, a neighbour like Gregor.
They demanded explanations from his father, raised their arms to make their points, tugged agitatedly at their beards, and moved back towards their room quite slowly.
In the meantime, the isolation which had suddenly fallen upon his sister after the sudden breaking off of the recital had overwhelmed her.
She had held onto the violin and bow in her limp hands for a little while and had continued to look at the sheet music as if she was still playing.
All at once she pulled herself together, placed the instrument in her mother's lap-- the mother was still sitting in her chair having trouble breathing for her lungs were labouring--and had run into the next room, which the lodgers, pressured by the father, were already approaching more rapidly.
One could observe how under the sister's practiced hands the sheets and pillows on the beds were thrown on high and arranged.
Even before the lodgers had reached the room, she was finished fixing the beds and was slipping out.
The father seemed so gripped once again with his stubbornness that he forgot about the respect which he always owed to his renters.
He pressed on and on, until at the door of the room the middle gentleman stamped loudly with his foot and thus brought the father to a standstill.
"I hereby declare," the middle lodger said, raising his hand and casting his glance both on the mother and the sister, "that considering the disgraceful conditions prevailing in this apartment and family"-- with this he spat decisively on the floor-- "I immediately cancel my room.
I will, of course, pay nothing at all for the days which I have lived here; on the contrary I shall think about whether or not I will initiate some sort of action against you, something which--believe me--will be very easy to establish."
He fell silent and looked directly in front of him, as if he was waiting for something.
In fact, his two friends immediately joined in with their opinions, "We also give immediate notice."
At that he seized the door handle, banged the door shut, and locked it.
The father groped his way tottering to his chair and let himself fall in it.
It looked as if he was stretching out for his usual evening snooze, but the heavy nodding of his head, which looked as if it was without support, showed that he was not sleeping at all.
Gregor had lain motionless the entire time in the spot where the lodgers had caught him.
Disappointment with the collapse of his plan and perhaps also weakness brought on by his severe hunger made it impossible for him to move.
He was certainly afraid that a general disaster would break over him at any moment, and he waited.
He was not even startled when the violin fell from the mother's lap, out from under her trembling fingers, and gave off a reverberating tone.
"My dear parents," said the sister banging her hand on the table by way of an introduction, "things cannot go on any longer in this way.
Maybe if you don't understand that, well, I do.
I will not utter my brother's name in front of this monster, and thus I say only that we must try to get rid of it.
We have tried what is humanly possible to take care of it and to be patient.
I believe that no one can criticize us in the slightest."
"She is right in a thousand ways," said the father to himself.
The mother, who was still incapable of breathing properly, began to cough numbly with her hand held up over her mouth and a manic expression in her eyes.
The sister hurried over to her mother and held her forehead.
The sister's words seemed to have led the father to certain reflections.
He sat upright, played with his uniform hat among the plates, which still lay on the table from the lodgers' evening meal, and looked now and then at the motionless
Gregor.
"We must try to get rid of it," the sister now said decisively to the father, for the mother, in her coughing fit, was not listening to anything.
"It is killing you both.
I see it coming. When people have to work as hard as we all do, they cannot also tolerate this endless torment at home.
I just can't go on any more."
And she broke out into such a crying fit that her tears flowed out down onto her mother's face.
She wiped them off her mother with mechanical motions of her hands.
"Child," said the father sympathetically and with obvious appreciation, "then what should we do?"
The sister only shrugged her shoulders as a sign of the perplexity which, in contrast to her previous confidence, had come over her while she was crying.
"If only he understood us," said the father in a semi-questioning tone.
The sister, in the midst of her sobbing, shook her hand energetically as a sign that there was no point thinking of that.
"If he only understood us," repeated the father and by shutting his eyes he absorbed the sister's conviction of the impossibility of this point, "then perhaps some compromise would be possible with him.
But as it is. . ." "It must be gotten rid of," cried the sister.
"That is the only way, father.
The fact that we have believed for so long, that is truly our real misfortune.
But how can it be Gregor?
If it were Gregor, he would have long ago realized that a communal life among human beings is not possible with such an animal and would have gone away voluntarily.
Then we would not have a brother, but we could go on living and honour his memory.
But this animal plagues us.
It drives away the lodgers, will obviously take over the entire apartment, and leave us to spend the night in the alley.
Just look, father," she suddenly cried out,
"he's already starting up again."
With a fright which was totally incomprehensible to Gregor, the sister even left the mother, pushed herself away from her chair, as if she would sooner sacrifice her mother than remain in Gregor's vicinity, and rushed behind her father who, excited merely by her behaviour, also stood up and half raised his arms in front of the sister as though to protect her.
But Gregor did not have any notion of wishing to create problems for anyone and certainly not for his sister.
He had just started to turn himself around in order to creep back into his room, quite a startling sight, since, as a result of his suffering condition, he had to guide himself through the difficulty of turning around with his head, in this process lifting and banging it against the floor several times.
He paused and looked around.
His good intentions seem to have been recognized.
Now they looked at him in silence and sorrow.
His mother lay in her chair, with her legs stretched out and pressed together; her eyes were almost shut from weariness.
The father and sister sat next to one another.
The sister had set her hands around the father's neck.
"Now perhaps I can actually turn myself around," thought Gregor and began the task again.
He couldn't stop puffing at the effort and had to rest now and then.
Besides, no one was urging him on.
It was all left to him on his own.
When he had completed turning around, he immediately began to wander straight back.
He was astonished at the great distance which separated him from his room and did not understand in the least how in his weakness he had covered the same distance a short time before, almost without noticing it.
Constantly intent only on creeping along quickly, he hardly paid any attention to the fact that no word or cry from his family interrupted him.
Only when he was already in the door did he turn his head, not completely, because he felt his neck growing stiff.
At any rate he still saw that behind him nothing had changed.
Only the sister was standing up.
His last glimpse brushed over the mother who was now completely asleep.
Hardly was he inside his room when the door was pushed shut very quickly, bolted fast, and barred.
Gregor was startled by the sudden commotion behind him, so much so that his little
It was his sister who had been in such a hurry.
She had stood up right away, had waited, and had then sprung forward nimbly.
Gregor had not heard anything of her approach.
She cried out "Finally!" to her parents, as she turned the key in the lock.
Gregor asked himself and looked around him in the darkness.
He soon made the discovery that he could no longer move at all.
He was not surprised at that.
On the contrary, it struck him as unnatural that up to this point he had really been able up to move around with these thin little legs.
Besides he felt relatively content.
True, he had pains throughout his entire body, but it seemed to him that they were gradually becoming weaker and weaker and would finally go away completely.
The rotten apple in his back and the inflamed surrounding area, entirely covered with white dust, he hardly noticed.
He remembered his family with deep feelings of love.
In this business, his own thought that he had to disappear was, if possible, even more decisive than his sister's.
He remained in this state of empty and peaceful reflection until the tower clock struck three o'clock in the morning.
From the window he witnessed the beginning of the general dawning outside.
Then without willing it, his head sank all the way down, and from his nostrils flowed out weakly his last breath.
Early in the morning the cleaning woman came.
In her sheer energy and haste she banged all the doors--in precisely the way people had already asked her to avoid--so much so that once she arrived a quiet sleep was no longer possible anywhere in the entire apartment.
In her customarily brief visit to Gregor she at first found nothing special.
She thought he lay so immobile there because he wanted to play the offended party. She gave him credit for as complete an understanding as possible.
Since she happened to be holding the long broom in her hand, she tried to tickle
Gregor with it from the door.
When that was quite unsuccessful, she became irritated and poked Gregor a little, and only when she had shoved him from his place without any resistance did she become attentive.
When she quickly realized the true state of affairs, her eyes grew large, she whistled to herself.
However, she didn't restrain herself for long.
She pulled open the door of the bedroom and yelled in a loud voice into the darkness,
"Come and look.
It's kicked the bucket.
It's lying there, totally snuffed!"
The Samsa married couple sat upright in their marriage bed and had to get over their fright at the cleaning woman before they managed to grasp her message.
But then Mr. and Mrs. Samsa climbed very quickly out of bed, one on either side.
Mr. Samsa threw the bedspread over his shoulders, Mrs. Samsa came out only in her night-shirt, and like this they stepped into Gregor's room.
Meanwhile, the door of the living room, in which Grete had slept since the lodgers had arrived on the scene, had also opened.
She was fully clothed, as if she had not slept at all; her white face also seem to indicate that.
"Dead?" said Mrs. Samsa and looked questioningly at the cleaning woman, although she could check everything on her own and even understand without a check.
"I should say so," said the cleaning woman and, by way of proof, poked Gregor's body with the broom a considerable distance more to the side.
Mrs. Samsa made a movement as if she wished to restrain the broom, but didn't do it.
"Well," said Mr. Samsa, "now we can give thanks to God."
He crossed himself, and the three women followed his example.
Grete, who did not take her eyes off the corpse, said, "Look how thin he was.
He had eaten nothing for such a long time.
The meals which came in here came out again exactly the same."
In fact, Gregor's body was completely flat and dry.
That was apparent really for the first time, now that he was no longer raised on his small limbs and nothing else distracted one's gaze.
"Grete, come into us for a moment," said Mrs. Samsa with a melancholy smile, and
Grete went, not without looking back at the corpse, behind her parents into the bed room.
The cleaning woman shut the door and opened the window wide.
In spite of the early morning, the fresh air was partly tinged with warmth.
It was already the end of March.
The three lodgers stepped out of their room and looked around for their breakfast, astonished that they had been forgotten.
"Where is the breakfast?" asked the middle one of the gentlemen grumpily to the cleaning woman.
However, she laid her finger to her lips and then quickly and silently indicated to the lodgers that they could come into Gregor's room.
So they came and stood in the room, which was already quite bright, around Gregor's corpse, their hands in the pockets of their somewhat worn jackets.
Then the door of the bed room opened, and Mr. Samsa appeared in his uniform, with his wife on one arm and his daughter on the other.
All were a little tear stained.
Now and then Grete pressed her face onto her father's arm.
"Get out of my apartment immediately," said Mr. Samsa and pulled open the door, without letting go of the women.
"What do you mean?" said the middle lodger, somewhat dismayed and with a sugary smile.
The two others kept their hands behind them and constantly rubbed them against each other, as if in joyful anticipation of a great squabble which must end up in their favour.
"I mean exactly what I say," replied Mr. Samsa and went directly with his two female companions up to the lodger.
The latter at first stood there motionless and looked at the floor, as if matters were arranging themselves in a new way in his head.
"All right, then we'll go," he said and looked up at Mr. Samsa as if, suddenly overcome by humility, he was asking fresh permission for this decision.
Mr. Samsa merely nodded to him repeatedly with his eyes open wide.
Following that, the lodger actually went with long strides immediately out into the hall.
His two friends had already been listening for a while with their hands quite still, and now they hopped smartly after him, as if afraid that Mr. Samsa could step into the hall ahead of them and disturb their reunion with their leader.
In the hall all three of them took their hats from the coat rack, pulled their canes from the cane holder, bowed silently, and left the apartment.
In what turned out to be an entirely groundless mistrust, Mr. Samsa stepped with the two women out onto the landing, leaned against the railing, and looked over as the three lodgers slowly but steadily made their way down the long staircase, disappeared on each floor in a certain turn of the stairwell, and in a few seconds came out again.
The deeper they proceeded, the more the Samsa family lost interest in them, and when a butcher with a tray on his head come to meet them and then with a proud bearing ascended the stairs high above them, Mr.
Samsa., together with the women, left the banister, and they all returned, as if relieved, back into their apartment.
They decided to pass that day resting and going for a stroll.
Not only had they earned this break from work, but there was no question that they really needed it.
And so they sat down at the table and wrote three letters of apology:
Mr. Samsa to his supervisor, Mrs. Samsa to her client, and Grete to her proprietor.
During the writing the cleaning woman came in to say that she was going off, for her morning work was finished.
The three people writing at first merely nodded, without glancing up.
Only when the cleaning woman was still unwilling to depart, did they look up angrily.
"Well?" asked Mr. Samsa.
The cleaning woman stood smiling in the doorway, as if she had a great stroke of
luck to report to the family but would only do it if she was asked directly.
The almost upright small ostrich feather in her hat, which had irritated Mr. Samsa during her entire service, swayed lightly in all directions.
"All right then, what do you really want?" asked Mrs. Samsa, whom the cleaning lady still usually respected.
"Well," answered the cleaning woman, smiling so happily she couldn't go on speaking right away, "about how that rubbish from the next room should be thrown out, you mustn't worry about it.
It's all taken care of."
Mrs. Samsa and Grete bent down to their letters, as though they wanted to go on writing.
Mr. Samsa, who noticed that the cleaning woman wanted to start describing everything in detail, decisively prevented her with an outstretched hand.
But since she was not allowed to explain, she remembered the great hurry she was in, and called out, clearly insulted, "Bye bye, everyone," turned around furiously and left the apartment with a fearful slamming of the door.
"This evening she'll be let go," said Mr. Samsa, but he got no answer from either his wife or from his daughter, because the cleaning woman seemed to have upset once again the tranquillity they had just attained.
They got up, went to the window, and remained there, with their arms about each other.
Mr. Samsa turned around in his chair in their direction and observed them quietly for a while.
Then he called out, "All right, come here then.
Let's finally get rid of old things.
And have a little consideration for me."
The women attended to him at once.
They rushed to him, caressed him, and quickly ended their letters.
Then all three left the apartment together, something they had not done for months now, and took the electric tram into the open air outside the city.
The car in which they were sitting by themselves was totally engulfed by the warm sun.
Leaning back comfortably in their seats, they talked to each other about future prospects, and they discovered that on closer observation these were not at all bad, for the three of them had employment, about which they had not really questioned each other at all, which was extremely favourable and with especially promising prospects.
The greatest improvement in their situation at this moment, of course, had to come from a change of dwelling.
Now they wanted to rent an apartment smaller and cheaper but better situated and generally more practical than the present one, which Gregor had found.
While they amused themselves in this way, it struck Mr. and Mrs. Samsa, almost at the same moment, how their daughter, who was getting more animated all the time, had blossomed recently, in spite of all the troubles which had made her cheeks pale, into a beautiful and voluptuous young woman.
Growing more silent and almost unconsciously understanding each other in their glances, they thought that the time was now at hand to seek out a good honest man for her.
And it was something of a confirmation of their new dreams and good intentions when at the end of their journey their daughter got up first and stretched her young body.
Let's get that shirt open Mr. Burns.
You don't have to tell me twice.
How are you feeling?
Excited.
You're going to do fine.
Thank you.
Say something.
Well I think it's obvious that we both find each other attractive and I think maybe after this we can...
No, no, no.
I mean...
Say, "testing, 1,2,3"
Testing 1, 2, 3.
Good.
Hey, don't worry.
We're gonna be right out of sight.
I just wish that Reggie was here, because he would be sooo jealous!
I'm not worried.
I'm not worried at all.
Hey, hey.
Do you guys wanna go get a room?
Before we meet the vicious kidnapper who could blow our heads off?
Hello Wood.
And look who it is?
Mr. Bear Chest 2012.
Sorry dude.
No autographs till we've concluded business.
So, where are your goons? Yeah.
I don't need them to handle you two.
Oh, God!
Oh, God!
You got the laptop?
Yeah, right here, right here um... And I can give it to you in one second. but I'd like to know something quickly first.
Did you poison Jcub?
What are you talking about?
We know you two had a huge fight the night before the murder.
What happened, huh?
Did he find out what you're doing and threatened to expose you?
And did he break up with you and you couldn't handle it?
Because no one messes with Ramone Santiago!
You know what?
He did find out what I was doing.
And he did want to break up with me over it.
But I could never hurt him.
He was my soulmate.
Part of me died with him.
So, you didn't poison Jcub?
But you do skim profits from your investors at your club, to milk your investors out of profits?
Is that true?
Are we close on that?
Yeah.
Isn't that why we're here?
I didn't quite get that.
Could you say it one more time, and a little bit louder and right there.
I said yeah.
What is this?
He said yeah!
He said yeah!
Move in! Move in!
Freeze Santiago!
You're under arrest!
Take him away fellas.
Don't kill me!
Don't kill me! Busted! Busted!
Nailed you!
Come on!
Good job, fellas.
Good job, Wood.
I was so good.
Did you hear me?
I heard everything.
You did amazing work.
I was right in there.
I was like...
Hey talk right here.
You did a great job.
Thank you.
Are you kidding me with this?
Where's Reggie?
Oh, he's in the trunk!
Reggie, are you in there?!
Oh, thank God!
Ow!
You must be so happy right now!
Uh, why?
You always had that kidnap fantasy.
Yes, Wood.
Fantasy.
It's a little different, when it's real!
Detective Winters!
Oh my God.
Thank you so much for coming to rescue me.
I love you so much!
Okay, alright.
Let go! Let go!
Alright boys.
I gotta go.
See you later Wood.
Call me.
We solved the case!
We're heroes!
We saved him!
We're not heroes, Wood.
You know, I believe Ramone.
I don't think he poisoned Jcub.
Which means were back to square one.
I mean, we don't even know how he was poisoned.
Bruce Daniels!
Oh, you mean that guy who host that comedy night "Drunk On Stage" at Akbar.
And lies about his age on IMDB.
You think he killed Jcub?
No remember.
Jcub left that voice memo about doing a set at Bruce's show.
That was right before he came to our party.
Hey, maybe this Bruce guy, who I have never heard of can shed some light on Jcub's state of mind and maybe
I don't know, remember something that can clear Todd for good.
Oh, he's doing a show tonight.
Let's go!
Perfect.
Wait a minute.
A live comedy show.
Well, let's just hope that nobody spots me in the in the audience.
Because after the day I've had, I am in no mood to perform.
No, it's not going to happen.
No way will I get up there.
No way.
A few years ago, I felt like I was stuck in a rut, so I decided to follow in the footsteps of the great American philosopher, Morgan Spurlock, and try something new for 30 days.
The idea is actually pretty simple.
Think about something you've always wanted to add to your life and try it for the next 30 days.
It turns out 30 days is just about the right amount of time to add a new habit or subtract a habit -- like watching the news -- from your life.
There's a few things I learned while doing these 30-day challenges.
The first was, instead of the months flying by, forgotten, the time was much more memorable.
This was part of a challenge I did to take a picture every day for a month.
And I remember exactly where I was and what I was doing that day.
I also noticed that as I started to do more and harder 30-day challenges, my self-confidence grew.
I went from desk-dwelling computer nerd to the kind of guy who bikes to work. For fun! (Laughter)
Even last year, I ended up hiking up Mt.
Kilimanjaro, the highest mountain in Africa.
I would never have been that adventurous before I started my 30-day challenges.
I also figured out that if you really want something badly enough, you can do anything for 30 days.
Have you ever wanted to write a novel?
Every November, tens of thousands of people try to write their own 50,000-word novel, from scratch, in 30 days.
It turns out, all you have to do is write 1,667 words a day for a month.
So I did.
By the way, the secret is not to go to sleep until you've written your words for the day.
You might be sleep-deprived, but you'll finish your novel.
Now is my book the next great American novel?
No.
I wrote it in a month.
It's awful. (Laughter)
But for the rest of my life, if I meet John Hodgman at a TED party, I don't have to say,
"I'm a computer scientist."
No, no, if I want to, I can say, "I'm a novelist."
(Laughter)
So here's one last thing I'd like to mention.
I learned that when I made small, sustainable changes, things I could keep doing, they were more likely to stick.
There's nothing wrong with big, crazy challenges.
In fact, they're a ton of fun.
But they're less likely to stick.
When I gave up sugar for 30 days, day 31 looked like this.
(Laughter)
So here's my question to you:
What are you waiting for?
I guarantee you the next 30 days are going to pass whether you like it or not, so why not think about something you have always wanted to try and give it a shot! For the next 30 days.
Thanks.
(Applause)
CHAPTER I THERE IS NO ONE LEFT
When Mary Lennox was sent to Misselthwaite Manor to live with her uncle everybody said she was the most disagreeable-looking child ever seen.
It was true, too.
She had a little thin face and a little thin body, thin light hair and a sour expression.
Her hair was yellow, and her face was yellow because she had been born in India and had always been ill in one way or another.
Her father had held a position under the English Government and had always been busy and ill himself, and her mother had been a great beauty who cared only to go to parties and amuse herself with gay people.
She had not wanted a little girl at all, and when Mary was born she handed her over to the care of an Ayah, who was made to understand that if she wished to please the
Mem Sahib she must keep the child out of sight as much as possible.
So when she was a sickly, fretful, ugly little baby she was kept out of the way, and when she became a sickly, fretful, toddling thing she was kept out of the way also.
She never remembered seeing familiarly anything but the dark faces of her Ayah and the other native servants, and as they always obeyed her and gave her her own way in everything, because the Mem Sahib would be angry if she was disturbed by her crying, by the time she was six years old she was as tyrannical and selfish a little pig as ever lived.
The young English governess who came to teach her to read and write disliked her so much that she gave up her place in three months, and when other governesses came to try to fill it they always went away in a shorter time than the first one.
So if Mary had not chosen to really want to know how to read books she would never have learned her letters at all.
One frightfully hot morning, when she was about nine years old, she awakened feeling very cross, and she became crosser still when she saw that the servant who stood by her bedside was not her Ayah.
"Why did you come?" she said to the strange woman.
"I will not let you stay.
Send my Ayah to me."
The woman looked frightened, but she only stammered that the Ayah could not come and when Mary threw herself into a passion and beat and kicked her, she looked only more frightened and repeated that it was not possible for the Ayah to come to Missie Sahib.
There was something mysterious in the air that morning.
Nothing was done in its regular order and several of the native servants seemed missing, while those whom Mary saw slunk or hurried about with ashy and scared faces.
But no one would tell her anything and her Ayah did not come.
She was actually left alone as the morning went on, and at last she wandered out into the garden and began to play by herself under a tree near the veranda.
She pretended that she was making a flower- bed, and she stuck big scarlet hibiscus blossoms into little heaps of earth, all the time growing more and more angry and muttering to herself the things she would say and the names she would call Saidie when she returned.
Daughter of Pigs!" she said, because to call a native a pig is the worst insult of all.
Pig!
She was grinding her teeth and saying this over and over again when she heard her mother come out on the veranda with some one.
She was with a fair young man and they stood talking together in low strange voices.
Mary knew the fair young man who looked like a boy.
She had heard that he was a very young officer who had just come from England.
The child stared at him, but she stared most at her mother.
She always did this when she had a chance to see her, because the Mem Sahib--Mary used to call her that oftener than anything else--was such a tall, slim, pretty person and wore such lovely clothes.
Her hair was like curly silk and she had a delicate little nose which seemed to be disdaining things, and she had large laughing eyes.
All her clothes were thin and floating, and Mary said they were "full of lace."
They looked fuller of lace than ever this morning, but her eyes were not laughing at all.
They were large and scared and lifted imploringly to the fair boy officer's face.
"Is it so very bad?
Oh, is it?"
Mary heard her say.
You ought to have gone to the hills two weeks ago."
"Awfully, Mrs. Lennox.
The Mem Sahib wrung her hands.
"Oh, I know I ought!" she cried.
"I only stayed to go to that silly dinner party.
What a fool I was!"
At that very moment such a loud sound of wailing broke out from the servants' quarters that she clutched the young man's arm, and Mary stood shivering from head to foot.
The wailing grew wilder and wilder.
"What is it?
What is it?"
Mrs. Lennox gasped.
"Some one has died," answered the boy officer.
Come with me!" and she turned and ran into the house.
"I did not know!" the Mem Sahib cried.
"Come with me!
After that, appalling things happened, and the mysteriousness of the morning was explained to Mary.
The cholera had broken out in its most fatal form and people were dying like flies.
The Ayah had been taken ill in the night, and it was because she had just died that the servants had wailed in the huts.
Before the next day three other servants were dead and others had run away in terror.
There was panic on every side, and dying people in all the bungalows.
During the confusion and bewilderment of the second day Mary hid herself in the nursery and was forgotten by everyone.
Nobody thought of her, nobody wanted her, and strange things happened of which she knew nothing.
Mary alternately cried and slept through the hours.
She only knew that people were ill and that she heard mysterious and frightening sounds.
Once she crept into the dining-room and found it empty, though a partly finished meal was on the table and chairs and plates looked as if they had been hastily pushed back when the diners rose suddenly for some reason.
The child ate some fruit and biscuits, and being thirsty she drank a glass of wine which stood nearly filled.
It was sweet, and she did not know how strong it was.
Very soon it made her intensely drowsy, and she went back to her nursery and shut herself in again, frightened by cries she heard in the huts and by the hurrying sound of feet.
The wine made her so sleepy that she could scarcely keep her eyes open and she lay down on her bed and knew nothing more for a long time.
Many things happened during the hours in which she slept so heavily, but she was not disturbed by the wails and the sound of things being carried in and out of the bungalow.
She had never known it to be so silent before.
The house was perfectly still.
She heard neither voices nor footsteps, and wondered if everybody had got well of the cholera and all the trouble was over.
She wondered also who would take care of her now her Ayah was dead.
There would be a new Ayah, and perhaps she would know some new stories.
Mary had been rather tired of the old ones.
She did not cry because her nurse had died.
She was not an affectionate child and had never cared much for any one.
The noise and hurrying about and wailing over the cholera had frightened her, and she had been angry because no one seemed to remember that she was alive.
Everyone was too panic-stricken to think of a little girl no one was fond of.
When people had the cholera it seemed that they remembered nothing but themselves.
But if everyone had got well again, surely some one would remember and come to look for her.
But no one came, and as she lay waiting the house seemed to grow more and more silent.
She heard something rustling on the matting and when she looked down she saw a little snake gliding along and watching her with eyes like jewels.
She was not frightened, because he was a harmless little thing who would not hurt her and he seemed in a hurry to get out of the room.
He slipped under the door as she watched him.
"How queer and quiet it is," she said.
"It sounds as if there were no one in the bungalow but me and the snake."
Almost the next minute she heard footsteps in the compound, and then on the veranda.
They were men's footsteps, and the men entered the bungalow and talked in low voices.
No one went to meet or speak to them and they seemed to open doors and look into rooms.
"What desolation!" she heard one voice say.
I heard there was a child, though no one ever saw her."
I suppose the child, too.
Mary was standing in the middle of the nursery when they opened the door a few minutes later.
She looked an ugly, cross little thing and was frowning because she was beginning to be hungry and feel disgracefully neglected.
The first man who came in was a large officer she had once seen talking to her father.
He looked tired and troubled, but when he saw her he was so startled that he almost jumped back.
"Barney!" he cried out.
"There is a child here!
A child alone!
In a place like this!
Mercy on us, who is she!" "I am Mary Lennox," the little girl said, drawing herself up stiffly.
She thought the man was very rude to call her father's bungalow "A place like this!"
"I fell asleep when everyone had the cholera and I have only just wakened up.
Why does nobody come?"
"It is the child no one ever saw!" exclaimed the man, turning to his companions.
"She has actually been forgotten!"
"Why was I forgotten?"
Mary said, stamping her foot.
"Why does nobody come?"
The young man whose name was Barney looked at her very sadly.
Mary even thought she saw him wink his eyes as if to wink tears away.
"Poor little kid!" he said.
"There is nobody left to come."
It was in that strange and sudden way that Mary found out that she had neither father nor mother left; that they had died and been carried away in the night, and that the few native servants who had not died also had left the house as quickly as they could get out of it, none of them even remembering that there was a Missie Sahib.
That was why the place was so quiet.
It was true that there was no one in the bungalow but herself and the little rustling snake. &gt;
CHAPTER II MlSTRESS MARY QUlTE CONTRARY
Mary had liked to look at her mother from a distance and she had thought her very pretty, but as she knew very little of her she could scarcely have been expected to love her or to miss her very much when she was gone.
She did not miss her at all, in fact, and as she was a self-absorbed child she gave her entire thought to herself, as she had always done.
If she had been older she would no doubt have been very anxious at being left alone in the world, but she was very young, and as she had always been taken care of, she supposed she always would be.
What she thought was that she would like to know if she was going to nice people, who would be polite to her and give her her own way as her Ayah and the other native servants had done.
She knew that she was not going to stay at the English clergyman's house where she was taken at first.
She did not want to stay.
The English clergyman was poor and he had five children nearly all the same age and they wore shabby clothes and were always quarreling and snatching toys from each other.
Mary hated their untidy bungalow and was so disagreeable to them that after the first day or two nobody would play with her.
By the second day they had given her a nickname which made her furious.
It was Basil who thought of it first.
Basil was a little boy with impudent blue eyes and a turned-up nose, and Mary hated him.
She was playing by herself under a tree, just as she had been playing the day the cholera broke out.
She was making heaps of earth and paths for a garden and Basil came and stood near to watch her.
Presently he got rather interested and suddenly made a suggestion.
"Why don't you put a heap of stones there and pretend it is a rockery?" he said.
"There in the middle," and he leaned over her to point.
"Go away!" cried Mary.
"I don't want boys.
Go away!"
For a moment Basil looked angry, and then he began to tease.
He was always teasing his sisters.
He danced round and round her and made faces and sang and laughed.
"Mistress Mary, quite contrary, How does your garden grow?
With silver bells, and cockle shells, And marigolds all in a row."
He sang it until the other children heard and laughed, too; and the crosser Mary got, the more they sang "Mistress Mary, quite contrary"; and after that as long as she stayed with them they called her "Mistress
Mary Quite Contrary" when they spoke of her to each other, and often when they spoke to her.
"You are going to be sent home," Basil said to her, "at the end of the week.
And we're glad of it." "I am glad of it, too," answered Mary.
"Where is home?" "She doesn't know where home is!" said
Basil, with seven-year-old scorn.
"It's England, of course.
Our grandmama lives there and our sister
Mabel was sent to her last year.
You are not going to your grandmama.
You have none.
You are going to your uncle.
His name is Mr. Archibald Craven."
"I don't know anything about him," snapped Mary.
"I know you don't," Basil answered.
"You don't know anything.
Girls never do.
I heard father and mother talking about him.
He lives in a great, big, desolate old house in the country and no one goes near him.
He's so cross he won't let them, and they wouldn't come if he would let them.
He's a hunchback, and he's horrid." "I don't believe you," said Mary; and she turned her back and stuck her fingers in her ears, because she would not listen any more.
But she thought over it a great deal afterward; and when Mrs. Crawford told her that night that she was going to sail away to England in a few days and go to her uncle, Mr. Archibald Craven, who lived at
Misselthwaite Manor, she looked so stony and stubbornly uninterested that they did not know what to think about her.
They tried to be kind to her, but she only turned her face away when Mrs. Crawford attempted to kiss her, and held herself stiffly when Mr. Crawford patted her shoulder.
"She is such a plain child," Mrs. Crawford said pityingly, afterward.
"And her mother was such a pretty creature.
She had a very pretty manner, too, and Mary has the most unattractive ways I ever saw in a child.
The children call her 'Mistress Mary Quite Contrary,' and though it's naughty of them, one can't help understanding it."
"Perhaps if her mother had carried her pretty face and her pretty manners oftener into the nursery Mary might have learned some pretty ways too.
It is very sad, now the poor beautiful thing is gone, to remember that many people never even knew that she had a child at all."
"I believe she scarcely ever looked at her," sighed Mrs. Crawford.
"When her Ayah was dead there was no one to give a thought to the little thing.
Think of the servants running away and leaving her all alone in that deserted bungalow.
Colonel McGrew said he nearly jumped out of his skin when he opened the door and found her standing by herself in the middle of the room."
Mary made the long voyage to England under the care of an officer's wife, who was taking her children to leave them in a boarding-school.
She was very much absorbed in her own little boy and girl, and was rather glad to hand the child over to the woman Mr. Archibald Craven sent to meet her, in
London.
The woman was his housekeeper at Misselthwaite Manor, and her name was Mrs.
She was a stout woman, with very red cheeks and sharp black eyes.
She wore a very purple dress, a black silk mantle with jet fringe on it and a black bonnet with purple velvet flowers which stuck up and trembled when she moved her head.
Mary did not like her at all, but as she very seldom liked people there was nothing remarkable in that; besides which it was very evident Mrs. Medlock did not think much of her.
"My word! she's a plain little piece of goods!" she said.
"And we'd heard that her mother was a beauty.
She hasn't handed much of it down, has she, ma'am?"
"Perhaps she will improve as she grows older," the officer's wife said good- naturedly.
"If she were not so sallow and had a nicer expression, her features are rather good.
Children alter so much." "She'll have to alter a good deal," answered Mrs. Medlock.
"And, there's nothing likely to improve children at Misselthwaite--if you ask me!"
They thought Mary was not listening because she was standing a little apart from them at the window of the private hotel they had gone to.
She was watching the passing buses and cabs and people, but she heard quite well and was made very curious about her uncle and the place he lived in.
What sort of a place was it, and what would he be like?
What was a hunchback?
She had never seen one.
Perhaps there were none in India.
Since she had been living in other people's houses and had had no Ayah, she had begun to feel lonely and to think queer thoughts which were new to her.
She had begun to wonder why she had never seemed to belong to anyone even when her father and mother had been alive.
Other children seemed to belong to their fathers and mothers, but she had never seemed to really be anyone's little girl.
She had had servants, and food and clothes, but no one had taken any notice of her.
She did not know that this was because she was a disagreeable child; but then, of course, she did not know she was disagreeable.
She often thought that other people were, but she did not know that she was so herself.
She thought Mrs. Medlock the most disagreeable person she had ever seen, with her common, highly colored face and her common fine bonnet.
When the next day they set out on their journey to Yorkshire, she walked through the station to the railway carriage with her head up and trying to keep as far away from her as she could, because she did not want to seem to belong to her.
It would have made her angry to think people imagined she was her little girl.
But Mrs. Medlock was not in the least disturbed by her and her thoughts.
She was the kind of woman who would "stand no nonsense from young ones."
At least, that is what she would have said if she had been asked.
She had not wanted to go to London just when her sister Maria's daughter was going to be married, but she had a comfortable, well paid place as housekeeper at
Misselthwaite Manor and the only way in which she could keep it was to do at once what Mr. Archibald Craven told her to do.
She never dared even to ask a question.
"Captain Lennox and his wife died of the cholera," Mr. Craven had said in his short, cold way.
So she packed her small trunk and made the journey.
The child is to be brought here.
You must go to London and bring her yourself."
Mary sat in her corner of the railway carriage and looked plain and fretful.
She had nothing to read or to look at, and she had folded her thin little black-gloved hands in her lap.
Her black dress made her look yellower than ever, and her limp light hair straggled from under her black crepe hat.
"A more marred-looking young one I never saw in my life," Mrs. Medlock thought.
(Marred is a Yorkshire word and means spoiled and pettish.)
She had never seen a child who sat so still without doing anything; and at last she got tired of watching her and began to talk in a brisk, hard voice.
"I suppose I may as well tell you something about where you are going to," she said.
"Do you know anything about your uncle?" "No," said Mary.
"Never heard your father and mother talk about him?"
"No," said Mary frowning.
She frowned because she remembered that her father and mother had never talked to her about anything in particular.
Certainly they had never told her things.
"Humph," muttered Mrs. Medlock, staring at her queer, unresponsive little face.
She did not say any more for a few moments and then she began again.
"I suppose you might as well be told something--to prepare you.
You are going to a queer place."
Mary said nothing at all, and Mrs. Medlock looked rather discomfited by her apparent indifference, but, after taking a breath, she went on.
"Not but that it's a grand big place in a gloomy way, and Mr. Craven's proud of it in his way--and that's gloomy enough, too.
The house is six hundred years old and it's on the edge of the moor, and there's near a hundred rooms in it, though most of them's shut up and locked.
And there's pictures and fine old furniture and things that's been there for ages, and there's a big park round it and gardens and trees with branches trailing to the ground-
-some of them."
She paused and took another breath. Mary had begun to listen in spite of herself.
It all sounded so unlike India, and anything new rather attracted her.
But she did not intend to look as if she were interested.
That was one of her unhappy, disagreeable ways.
So she sat still.
"Well," said Mrs. Medlock.
"What do you think of it?"
"Nothing," she answered.
"I know nothing about such places."
That made Mrs. Medlock laugh a short sort of laugh.
"Eh!" she said, "but you are like an old woman.
"It doesn't matter" said Mary, "whether I care or not."
"You are right enough there," said Mrs. Medlock.
"It doesn't.
What you're to be kept at Misselthwaite Manor for I don't know, unless because it's the easiest way. He's not going to trouble himself about you, that's sure and certain.
He never troubles himself about no one."
She stopped herself as if she had just remembered something in time.
"He's got a crooked back," she said.
"That set him wrong.
He was a sour young man and got no good of all his money and big place till he was married."
Mary's eyes turned toward her in spite of her intention not to seem to care.
She had never thought of the hunchback's being married and she was a trifle surprised.
Mrs. Medlock saw this, and as she was a talkative woman she continued with more interest.
This was one way of passing some of the time, at any rate.
"She was a sweet, pretty thing and he'd have walked the world over to get her a blade o' grass she wanted.
Nobody thought she'd marry him, but she did, and people said she married him for his money.
But she didn't--she didn't," positively.
"When she died--"
Mary gave a little involuntary jump.
"Oh! did she die!" she exclaimed, quite without meaning to.
She had just remembered a French fairy story she had once read called "Riquet a la
Houppe."
It had been about a poor hunchback and a beautiful princess and it had made her suddenly sorry for Mr. Archibald Craven.
"Yes, she died," Mrs. Medlock answered.
"And it made him queerer than ever.
He cares about nobody.
He won't see people.
Most of the time he goes away, and when he is at Misselthwaite he shuts himself up in the West Wing and won't let any one but Pitcher see him.
Pitcher's an old fellow, but he took care of him when he was a child and he knows his ways."
It sounded like something in a book and it did not make Mary feel cheerful.
A house with a hundred rooms, nearly all shut up and with their doors locked--a house on the edge of a moor--whatsoever a moor was--sounded dreary.
A man with a crooked back who shut himself up also!
She stared out of the window with her lips pinched together, and it seemed quite natural that the rain should have begun to pour down in gray slanting lines and splash and stream down the window-panes.
If the pretty wife had been alive she might have made things cheerful by being something like her own mother and by running in and out and going to parties as she had done in frocks "full of lace."
But she was not there any more.
"You needn't expect to see him, because ten to one you won't," said Mrs. Medlock.
"And you mustn't expect that there will be people to talk to you.
You'll have to play about and look after yourself.
You'll be told what rooms you can go into and what rooms you're to keep out of.
There's gardens enough.
But when you're in the house don't go wandering and poking about.
Mr. Craven won't have it."
"I shall not want to go poking about," said sour little Mary and just as suddenly as she had begun to be rather sorry for Mr. Archibald Craven she began to cease to be sorry and to think he was unpleasant enough to deserve all that had happened to him.
And she turned her face toward the streaming panes of the window of the railway carriage and gazed out at the gray rain-storm which looked as if it would go on forever and ever.
She watched it so long and steadily that the grayness grew heavier and heavier before her eyes and she fell asleep. &gt;
CHAPTER ill ACROSS THE MOOR
She slept a long time, and when she awakened Mrs. Medlock had bought a
lunchbasket at one of the stations and they had some chicken and cold beef and bread and butter and some hot tea.
The rain seemed to be streaming down more heavily than ever and everybody in the station wore wet and glistening waterproofs.
The guard lighted the lamps in the carriage, and Mrs. Medlock cheered up very much over her tea and chicken and beef.
She ate a great deal and afterward fell asleep herself, and Mary sat and stared at her and watched her fine bonnet slip on one side until she herself fell asleep once more in the corner of the carriage, lulled by the splashing of the rain against the windows.
It was quite dark when she awakened again.
The train had stopped at a station and Mrs.
Medlock was shaking her.
"You have had a sleep!" she said.
"It's time to open your eyes!
We're at Thwaite Station and we've got a long drive before us."
Mary stood up and tried to keep her eyes open while Mrs. Medlock collected her parcels.
The little girl did not offer to help her, because in India native servants always picked up or carried things and it seemed quite proper that other people should wait on one.
The station was a small one and nobody but themselves seemed to be getting out of the train.
The station-master spoke to Mrs. Medlock in a rough, good-natured way, pronouncing his words in a queer broad fashion which Mary found out afterward was Yorkshire.
"I see tha's got back," he said.
"An' tha's browt th' young 'un with thee." "Aye, that's her," answered Mrs. Medlock, speaking with a Yorkshire accent herself and jerking her head over her shoulder toward Mary.
"How's thy Missus?" "Well enow.
Th' carriage is waitin' outside for thee."
A brougham stood on the road before the little outside platform.
Mary saw that it was a smart carriage and that it was a smart footman who helped her in.
His long waterproof coat and the waterproof covering of his hat were shining and dripping with rain as everything was, the burly station-master included.
When he shut the door, mounted the box with the coachman, and they drove off, the little girl found herself seated in a comfortably cushioned corner, but she was not inclined to go to sleep again.
She sat and looked out of the window, curious to see something of the road over which she was being driven to the queer place Mrs. Medlock had spoken of.
She was not at all a timid child and she was not exactly frightened, but she felt that there was no knowing what might happen in a house with a hundred rooms nearly all shut up--a house standing on the edge of a moor.
"What is a moor?" she said suddenly to Mrs. Medlock.
"Look out of the window in about ten minutes and you'll see," the woman answered.
"We've got to drive five miles across
Missel Moor before we get to the Manor.
You won't see much because it's a dark night, but you can see something."
Mary asked no more questions but waited in the darkness of her corner, keeping her eyes on the window.
The carriage lamps cast rays of light a little distance ahead of them and she caught glimpses of the things they passed.
After they had left the station they had driven through a tiny village and she had seen whitewashed cottages and the lights of a public house.
Then they had passed a church and a vicarage and a little shop-window or so in a cottage with toys and sweets and odd things set out for sale.
Then they were on the highroad and she saw hedges and trees.
After that there seemed nothing different for a long time--or at least it seemed a long time to her.
At last the horses began to go more slowly, as if they were climbing up-hill, and presently there seemed to be no more hedges and no more trees.
She could see nothing, in fact, but a dense darkness on either side.
She leaned forward and pressed her face against the window just as the carriage gave a big jolt.
"Eh!
We're on the moor now sure enough," said Mrs. Medlock.
The carriage lamps shed a yellow light on a rough-looking road which seemed to be cut through bushes and low-growing things which ended in the great expanse of dark apparently spread out before and around them.
A wind was rising and making a singular, wild, low, rushing sound.
"It's--it's not the sea, is it?" said Mary, looking round at her companion.
"No, not it," answered Mrs. Medlock.
"Nor it isn't fields nor mountains, it's just miles and miles and miles of wild land that nothing grows on but heather and gorse and broom, and nothing lives on but wild ponies and sheep."
"I feel as if it might be the sea, if there were water on it," said Mary.
"It sounds like the sea just now." "That's the wind blowing through the bushes," Mrs. Medlock said.
"It's a wild, dreary enough place to my mind, though there's plenty that likes it-- particularly when the heather's in bloom."
On and on they drove through the darkness, and though the rain stopped, the wind rushed by and whistled and made strange sounds.
The road went up and down, and several times the carriage passed over a little bridge beneath which water rushed very fast with a great deal of noise.
Mary felt as if the drive would never come to an end and that the wide, bleak moor was a wide expanse of black ocean through which she was passing on a strip of dry land.
"I don't like it," she said to herself.
"I don't like it," and she pinched her thin lips more tightly together.
The horses were climbing up a hilly piece of road when she first caught sight of a
light.
Mrs. Medlock saw it as soon as she did and drew a long sigh of relief.
"Eh, I am glad to see that bit o' light twinkling," she exclaimed.
"It's the light in the lodge window.
We shall get a good cup of tea after a bit, at all events."
It was "after a bit," as she said, for when the carriage passed through the park gates there was still two miles of avenue to drive through and the trees (which nearly met overhead) made it seem as if they were driving through a long dark vault.
They drove out of the vault into a clear space and stopped before an immensely long but low-built house which seemed to ramble round a stone court.
At first Mary thought that there were no lights at all in the windows, but as she got out of the carriage she saw that one room in a corner upstairs showed a dull glow.
The entrance door was a huge one made of massive, curiously shaped panels of oak studded with big iron nails and bound with great iron bars.
It opened into an enormous hall, which was so dimly lighted that the faces in the portraits on the walls and the figures in the suits of armor made Mary feel that she did not want to look at them.
As she stood on the stone floor she looked a very small, odd little black figure, and she felt as small and lost and odd as she looked.
A neat, thin old man stood near the manservant who opened the door for them.
"You are to take her to her room," he said in a husky voice.
"He doesn't want to see her.
He's going to London in the morning." "So long as I know what's expected of me, I can manage."
"What's expected of you, Mrs. Medlock," Mr. Pitcher said, "is that you make sure that he's not disturbed and that he doesn't see what he doesn't want to see."
And then Mary Lennox was led up a broad staircase and down a long corridor and up a short flight of steps and through another corridor and another, until a door opened in a wall and she found herself in a room with a fire in it and a supper on a table.
Mrs. Medlock said unceremoniously:
"Well, here you are!
This room and the next are where you'll live--and you must keep to them.
Don't you forget that!"
It was in this way Mistress Mary arrived at Misselthwaite Manor and she had perhaps never felt quite so contrary in all her life. &gt;
CHAPTER IV MARTHA
When she opened her eyes in the morning it was because a young housemaid had come into her room to light the fire and was kneeling on the hearth-rug raking out the cinders noisily.
Mary lay and watched her for a few moments and then began to look about the room.
She had never seen a room at all like it and thought it curious and gloomy.
The walls were covered with tapestry with a forest scene embroidered on it.
There were fantastically dressed people under the trees and in the distance there was a glimpse of the turrets of a castle.
There were hunters and horses and dogs and ladies.
Mary felt as if she were in the forest with them.
Out of a deep window she could see a great climbing stretch of land which seemed to have no trees on it, and to look rather like an endless, dull, purplish sea.
"What is that?" she said, pointing out of the window.
Martha, the young housemaid, who had just risen to her feet, looked and pointed also.
"That there?" she said.
"Yes." "That's th' moor," with a good-natured grin. "Does tha' like it?"
"No," answered Mary.
"I hate it." "That's because tha'rt not used to it,"
Martha said, going back to her hearth.
"Tha' thinks it's too big an' bare now.
But tha' will like it."
"Do you?" inquired Mary.
"Aye, that I do," answered Martha, cheerfully polishing away at the grate.
"I just love it.
It's none bare.
It's covered wi' growin' things as smells sweet.
It's fair lovely in spring an' summer when th' gorse an' broom an' heather's in flower.
It smells o' honey an' there's such a lot o' fresh air--an' th' sky looks so high an' th' bees an' skylarks makes such a nice noise hummin' an' singin'.
Eh!
I wouldn't live away from th' moor for anythin'."
Mary listened to her with a grave, puzzled expression.
The native servants she had been used to in India were not in the least like this.
They were obsequious and servile and did not presume to talk to their masters as if they were their equals.
They made salaams and called them "protector of the poor" and names of that sort.
Indian servants were commanded to do things, not asked.
It was not the custom to say "please" and "thank you" and Mary had always slapped her
Ayah in the face when she was angry.
She wondered a little what this girl would do if one slapped her in the face.
She was a round, rosy, good-natured-looking creature, but she had a sturdy way which made Mistress Mary wonder if she might not even slap back--if the person who slapped her was only a little girl.
"You are a strange servant," she said from her pillows, rather haughtily.
Martha sat up on her heels, with her blacking-brush in her hand, and laughed, without seeming the least out of temper.
"Eh!
I know that," she said.
"If there was a grand Missus at
Misselthwaite I should never have been even one of th' under house-maids.
I might have been let to be scullerymaid but I'd never have been let upstairs.
I'm too common an' I talk too much Yorkshire.
But this is a funny house for all it's so grand.
Seems like there's neither Master nor Mistress except Mr. Pitcher an' Mrs.
Medlock.
Mr. Craven, he won't be troubled about anythin' when he's here, an' he's nearly always away.
Mrs. Medlock gave me th' place out o' kindness.
She told me she could never have done it if Misselthwaite had been like other big houses." "Are you going to be my servant?"
Mary asked, still in her imperious little Indian way.
Martha began to rub her grate again.
"I'm Mrs. Medlock's servant," she said stoutly.
"An' she's Mr. Craven's--but I'm to do the housemaid's work up here an' wait on you a bit.
But you won't need much waitin' on."
"Who is going to dress me?" demanded Mary.
Martha sat up on her heels again and stared.
She spoke in broad Yorkshire in her amazement.
"Canna' tha' dress thysen!" she said.
"What do you mean?
I don't understand your language," said
Mary.
"Eh!
I forgot," Martha said.
"Mrs. Medlock told me I'd have to be careful or you wouldn't know what I was sayin'.
I mean can't you put on your own clothes?"
"No," answered Mary, quite indignantly.
"I never did in my life.
My Ayah dressed me, of course."
"Well," said Martha, evidently not in the least aware that she was impudent, "it's time tha' should learn.
Tha' cannot begin younger.
It'll do thee good to wait on thysen a bit.
My mother always said she couldn't see why grand people's children didn't turn out fair fools--what with nurses an' bein' washed an' dressed an' took out to walk as if they was puppies!"
"It is different in India," said Mistress Mary disdainfully.
She could scarcely stand this.
But Martha was not at all crushed.
"Eh!
I can see it's different," she answered almost sympathetically.
"I dare say it's because there's such a lot o' blacks there instead o' respectable white people.
When I heard you was comin' from India I thought you was a black too."
Mary sat up in bed furious.
"What!" she said.
"What!
You thought I was a native.
You--you daughter of a pig!"
Martha stared and looked hot.
"Who are you callin' names?" she said.
"You needn't be so vexed.
That's not th' way for a young lady to talk.
When you read about 'em in tracts they're always very religious.
You always read as a black's a man an' a brother.
I've never seen a black an' I was fair pleased to think I was goin' to see one close.
When I come in to light your fire this mornin' I crep' up to your bed an' pulled th' cover back careful to look at you.
An' there you was," disappointedly, "no more black than me--for all you're so yeller."
Mary did not even try to control her rage and humiliation.
"You thought I was a native!
You dared!
You don't know anything about natives!
They are not people--they're servants who must salaam to you.
You know nothing about India.
You know nothing about anything!"
She was in such a rage and felt so helpless before the girl's simple stare, and somehow she suddenly felt so horribly lonely and far away from everything she understood and which understood her, that she threw herself face downward on the pillows and burst into passionate sobbing.
She sobbed so unrestrainedly that good- natured Yorkshire Martha was a little frightened and quite sorry for her.
She went to the bed and bent over her.
"Eh! you mustn't cry like that there!" she begged.
"You mustn't for sure.
I didn't know you'd be vexed.
I don't know anythin' about anythin'--just like you said.
I beg your pardon, Miss. Do stop cryin'."
There was something comforting and really friendly in her queer Yorkshire speech and sturdy way which had a good effect on Mary.
She gradually ceased crying and became quiet.
Martha looked relieved.
"It's time for thee to get up now," she said.
"Mrs. Medlock said I was to carry tha' breakfast an' tea an' dinner into th' room next to this.
It's been made into a nursery for thee.
I'll help thee on with thy clothes if tha'll get out o' bed.
If th' buttons are at th' back tha' cannot button them up tha'self."
When Mary at last decided to get up, the clothes Martha took from the wardrobe were not the ones she had worn when she arrived the night before with Mrs. Medlock.
"Those are not mine," she said.
"Mine are black." She looked the thick white wool coat and dress over, and added with cool approval:
"Those are nicer than mine."
"These are th' ones tha' must put on," Martha answered.
"Mr. Craven ordered Mrs. Medlock to get 'em in London.
He said 'I won't have a child dressed in black wanderin' about like a lost soul,' he said.
'It'd make the place sadder than it is.
Put color on her.'
Mother she said she knew what he meant.
Mother always knows what a body means.
She doesn't hold with black hersel'." "I hate black things," said Mary.
The dressing process was one which taught them both something.
Martha had "buttoned up" her little sisters and brothers but she had never seen a child who stood still and waited for another person to do things for her as if she had neither hands nor feet of her own.
"Why doesn't tha' put on tha' own shoes?" she said when Mary quietly held out her foot.
"My Ayah did it," answered Mary, staring.
"It was the custom."
She said that very often--"It was the custom."
The native servants were always saying it.
If one told them to do a thing their ancestors had not done for a thousand years they gazed at one mildly and said, "It is not the custom" and one knew that was the end of the matter.
It had not been the custom that Mistress Mary should do anything but stand and allow herself to be dressed like a doll, but before she was ready for breakfast she began to suspect that her life at
Misselthwaite Manor would end by teaching her a number of things quite new to her-- things such as putting on her own shoes and stockings, and picking up things she let fall.
If Martha had been a well-trained fine young lady's maid she would have been more subservient and respectful and would have known that it was her business to brush hair, and button boots, and pick things up and lay them away.
She was, however, only an untrained Yorkshire rustic who had been brought up in a moorland cottage with a swarm of little brothers and sisters who had never dreamed of doing anything but waiting on themselves and on the younger ones who were either babies in arms or just learning to totter about and tumble over things.
If Mary Lennox had been a child who was ready to be amused she would perhaps have
laughed at Martha's readiness to talk, but Mary only listened to her coldly and wondered at her freedom of manner.
At first she was not at all interested, but gradually, as the girl rattled on in her good-tempered, homely way, Mary began to notice what she was saying.
"Eh! you should see 'em all," she said.
"There's twelve of us an' my father only gets sixteen shilling a week.
I can tell you my mother's put to it to get porridge for 'em all.
They tumble about on th' moor an' play there all day an' mother says th' air of th' moor fattens 'em.
She says she believes they eat th' grass same as th' wild ponies do.
Our Dickon, he's twelve years old and he's got a young pony he calls his own."
"Where did he get it?" asked Mary.
"He found it on th' moor with its mother when it was a little one an' he began to make friends with it an' give it bits o' bread an' pluck young grass for it.
And it got to like him so it follows him about an' it lets him get on its back.
Dickon's a kind lad an' animals likes him."
Mary had never possessed an animal pet of her own and had always thought she should like one.
So she began to feel a slight interest in Dickon, and as she had never before been interested in any one but herself, it was the dawning of a healthy sentiment.
When she went into the room which had been made into a nursery for her, she found that it was rather like the one she had slept in.
It was not a child's room, but a grown-up person's room, with gloomy old pictures on the walls and heavy old oak chairs.
A table in the center was set with a good substantial breakfast.
But she had always had a very small appetite, and she looked with something more than indifference at the first plate Martha set before her.
"I don't want it," she said.
"Tha' doesn't want thy porridge!" Martha exclaimed incredulously.
"No." "Tha' doesn't know how good it is.
Put a bit o' treacle on it or a bit o' sugar."
"I don't want it," repeated Mary.
"Eh!" said Martha.
"I can't abide to see good victuals go to waste.
If our children was at this table they'd clean it bare in five minutes."
"Why?" said Mary coldly.
"Why!" echoed Martha.
"Because they scarce ever had their stomachs full in their lives. They're as hungry as young hawks an' foxes."
"I don't know what it is to be hungry," said Mary, with the indifference of ignorance.
Martha looked indignant.
"Well, it would do thee good to try it.
I can see that plain enough," she said outspokenly.
"I've no patience with folk as sits an' just stares at good bread an' meat.
My word! don't I wish Dickon and Phil an' Jane an' th' rest of 'em had what's here under their pinafores." "Why don't you take it to them?" suggested
Mary.
"It's not mine," answered Martha stoutly.
"An' this isn't my day out.
I get my day out once a month same as th' rest.
Then I go home an' clean up for mother an' give her a day's rest."
Mary drank some tea and ate a little toast and some marmalade.
"You wrap up warm an' run out an' play you," said Martha.
"It'll do you good and give you some stomach for your meat."
Mary went to the window.
There were gardens and paths and big trees, but everything looked dull and wintry.
"Out?
Why should I go out on a day like this?"
"Well, if tha' doesn't go out tha'It have to stay in, an' what has tha' got to do?"
Mary glanced about her.
There was nothing to do.
When Mrs. Medlock had prepared the nursery she had not thought of amusement.
Perhaps it would be better to go and see what the gardens were like.
"Who will go with me?" she inquired.
Martha stared.
"You'll go by yourself," she answered.
"You'll have to learn to play like other children does when they haven't got sisters and brothers.
Our Dickon goes off on th' moor by himself an' plays for hours.
That's how he made friends with th' pony.
He's got sheep on th' moor that knows him, an' birds as comes an' eats out of his hand.
However little there is to eat, he always saves a bit o' his bread to coax his pets."
It was really this mention of Dickon which made Mary decide to go out, though she was not aware of it.
There would be, birds outside though there would not be ponies or sheep.
They would be different from the birds in India and it might amuse her to look at them.
Martha found her coat and hat for her and a pair of stout little boots and she showed her her way downstairs.
"If tha' goes round that way tha'll come to th' gardens," she said, pointing to a gate in a wall of shrubbery.
"There's lots o' flowers in summer-time, but there's nothin' bloomin' now."
She seemed to hesitate a second before she added, "One of th' gardens is locked up.
No one has been in it for ten years."
"Why?" asked Mary in spite of herself.
Here was another locked door added to the hundred in the strange house.
"Mr. Craven had it shut when his wife died so sudden.
He won't let no one go inside.
It was her garden.
He locked th' door an' dug a hole and buried th' key.
There's Mrs. Medlock's bell ringing--I must run."
After she was gone Mary turned down the walk which led to the door in the shrubbery.
She could not help thinking about the garden which no one had been into for ten years.
She wondered what it would look like and whether there were any flowers still alive in it.
When she had passed through the shrubbery gate she found herself in great gardens, with wide lawns and winding walks with clipped borders.
There were trees, and flower-beds, and evergreens clipped into strange shapes, and a large pool with an old gray fountain in its midst.
But the flower-beds were bare and wintry and the fountain was not playing.
This was not the garden which was shut up.
How could a garden be shut up?
You could always walk into a garden.
She was just thinking this when she saw that, at the end of the path she was following, there seemed to be a long wall, with ivy growing over it.
She was not familiar enough with England to know that she was coming upon the kitchen- gardens where the vegetables and fruit were growing.
She went toward the wall and found that there was a green door in the ivy, and that it stood open.
This was not the closed garden, evidently, and she could go into it.
She went through the door and found that it was a garden with walls all round it and that it was only one of several walled gardens which seemed to open into one another.
She saw another open green door, revealing bushes and pathways between beds containing winter vegetables.
Fruit-trees were trained flat against the wall, and over some of the beds there were glass frames.
The place was bare and ugly enough, Mary thought, as she stood and stared about her.
It might be nicer in summer when things were green, but there was nothing pretty about it now.
Presently an old man with a spade over his shoulder walked through the door leading from the second garden.
He looked startled when he saw Mary, and then touched his cap.
He had a surly old face, and did not seem at all pleased to see her--but then she was displeased with his garden and wore her "quite contrary" expression, and certainly did not seem at all pleased to see him.
"What is this place?" she asked.
"One o' th' kitchen-gardens," he answered.
"What is that?" said Mary, pointing through the other green door.
"Another of 'em," shortly.
"There's another on t'other side o' th' wall an' there's th' orchard t'other side o' that." "Can I go in them?" asked Mary.
"If tha' likes.
But there's nowt to see."
Mary made no response.
She went down the path and through the second green door.
There, she found more walls and winter vegetables and glass frames, but in the second wall there was another green door and it was not open.
Perhaps it led into the garden which no one had seen for ten years.
As she was not at all a timid child and always did what she wanted to do, Mary went to the green door and turned the handle.
She hoped the door would not open because she wanted to be sure she had found the mysterious garden--but it did open quite easily and she walked through it and found herself in an orchard.
There were walls all round it also and trees trained against them, and there were bare fruit-trees growing in the winter- browned grass--but there was no green door to be seen anywhere.
Mary looked for it, and yet when she had entered the upper end of the garden she had noticed that the wall did not seem to end with the orchard but to extend beyond it as if it enclosed a place at the other side.
She could see the tops of trees above the wall, and when she stood still she saw a bird with a bright red breast sitting on the topmost branch of one of them, and suddenly he burst into his winter song-- almost as if he had caught sight of her and was calling to her.
She stopped and listened to him and somehow his cheerful, friendly little whistle gave her a pleased feeling--even a disagreeable little girl may be lonely, and the big closed house and big bare moor and big bare gardens had made this one feel as if there was no one left in the world but herself.
If she had been an affectionate child, who had been used to being loved, she would have broken her heart, but even though she was "Mistress Mary Quite Contrary" she was desolate, and the bright-breasted little bird brought a look into her sour little face which was almost a smile.
She listened to him until he flew away.
He was not like an Indian bird and she liked him and wondered if she should ever see him again.
Perhaps he lived in the mysterious garden and knew all about it.
Perhaps it was because she had nothing whatever to do that she thought so much of the deserted garden.
She was curious about it and wanted to see what it was like.
Why had Mr. Archibald Craven buried the key?
If he had liked his wife so much why did he hate her garden?
She wondered if she should ever see him, but she knew that if she did she should not like him, and he would not like her, and that she should only stand and stare at him and say nothing, though she should be wanting dreadfully to ask him why he had done such a queer thing.
"People never like me and I never like people," she thought.
"And I never can talk as the Crawford children could.
They were always talking and laughing and making noises."
She thought of the robin and of the way he seemed to sing his song at her, and as she remembered the tree-top he perched on she stopped rather suddenly on the path.
"I believe that tree was in the secret garden--I feel sure it was," she said.
"There was a wall round the place and there was no door."
She walked back into the first kitchen- garden she had entered and found the old man digging there.
She went and stood beside him and watched him a few moments in her cold little way.
He took no notice of her and so at last she spoke to him.
"I have been into the other gardens," she said.
"There was nothin' to prevent thee," he answered crustily.
"I went into the orchard." "There was no dog at th' door to bite thee," he answered.
"There was no door there into the other garden," said Mary.
"What garden?" he said in a rough voice, stopping his digging for a moment.
"The one on the other side of the wall," answered Mistress Mary.
"There are trees there--I saw the tops of them.
A bird with a red breast was sitting on one of them and he sang."
To her surprise the surly old weather- beaten face actually changed its expression.
A slow smile spread over it and the gardener looked quite different.
It made her think that it was curious how much nicer a person looked when he smiled.
She had not thought of it before.
He turned about to the orchard side of his garden and began to whistle--a low soft whistle.
She could not understand how such a surly man could make such a coaxing sound.
Almost the next moment a wonderful thing happened.
She heard a soft little rushing flight through the air--and it was the bird with the red breast flying to them, and he actually alighted on the big clod of earth quite near to the gardener's foot.
"Here he is," chuckled the old man, and then he spoke to the bird as if he were speaking to a child.
"Where has tha' been, tha' cheeky little beggar?" he said.
"I've not seen thee before today.
Has tha, begun tha' courtin' this early in th' season?
Tha'rt too forrad."
The bird put his tiny head on one side and looked up at him with his soft bright eye which was like a black dewdrop.
He seemed quite familiar and not the least afraid.
He hopped about and pecked the earth briskly, looking for seeds and insects.
It actually gave Mary a queer feeling in her heart, because he was so pretty and cheerful and seemed so like a person.
He had a tiny plump body and a delicate beak, and slender delicate legs.
"Will he always come when you call him?" she asked almost in a whisper.
"Aye, that he will.
I've knowed him ever since he was a fledgling.
He come out of th' nest in th' other garden an' when first he flew over th' wall he was too weak to fly back for a few days an' we got friendly.
When he went over th' wall again th' rest of th' brood was gone an' he was lonely an' he come back to me." "What kind of a bird is he?"
Mary asked.
"Doesn't tha' know?
He's a robin redbreast an' they're th' friendliest, curiousest birds alive.
They're almost as friendly as dogs--if you know how to get on with 'em.
Watch him peckin' about there an' lookin' round at us now an' again.
He knows we're talkin' about him."
It was the queerest thing in the world to see the old fellow.
He looked at the plump little scarlet- waistcoated bird as if he were both proud and fond of him.
"He's a conceited one," he chuckled.
"He likes to hear folk talk about him.
An' curious--bless me, there never was his like for curiosity an' meddlin'.
He's always comin' to see what I'm plantin'.
He knows all th' things Mester Craven never troubles hissel' to find out.
He's th' head gardener, he is."
The robin hopped about busily pecking the soil and now and then stopped and looked at them a little.
Mary thought his black dewdrop eyes gazed at her with great curiosity.
It really seemed as if he were finding out all about her.
The queer feeling in her heart increased.
"Where did the rest of the brood fly to?" she asked.
"There's no knowin'.
The old ones turn 'em out o' their nest an' make 'em fly an' they're scattered before you know it.
This one was a knowin' one an' he knew he was lonely."
Mistress Mary went a step nearer to the robin and looked at him very hard.
"I'm lonely," she said.
She had not known before that this was one of the things which made her feel sour and cross.
She seemed to find it out when the robin looked at her and she looked at the robin.
The old gardener pushed his cap back on his bald head and stared at her a minute.
"Art tha' th' little wench from India?" he asked.
Tha'It be lonlier before tha's done," he said.
"Then no wonder tha'rt lonely.
He began to dig again, driving his spade deep into the rich black garden soil while the robin hopped about very busily employed.
"What is your name?"
Mary inquired.
He stood up to answer her.
"Ben Weatherstaff," he answered, and then he added with a surly chuckle, "I'm lonely mysel' except when he's with me," and he jerked his thumb toward the robin.
"He's th' only friend I've got."
"I have no friends at all," said Mary.
"I never had.
My Ayah didn't like me and I never played with any one."
It is a Yorkshire habit to say what you think with blunt frankness, and old Ben
"Tha' an' me are a good bit alike," he said.
"We was wove out of th' same cloth.
We're neither of us good lookin' an' we're both of us as sour as we look.
We've got the same nasty tempers, both of us, I'll warrant."
This was plain speaking, and Mary Lennox had never heard the truth about herself in her life.
Native servants always salaamed and submitted to you, whatever you did.
She had never thought much about her looks, but she wondered if she was as unattractive as Ben Weatherstaff and she also wondered if she looked as sour as he had looked before the robin came.
She actually began to wonder also if she was "nasty tempered."
She felt uncomfortable.
Suddenly a clear rippling little sound broke out near her and she turned round.
She was standing a few feet from a young apple-tree and the robin had flown on to one of its branches and had burst out into a scrap of a song.
Ben Weatherstaff laughed outright.
"What did he do that for?" asked Mary.
"He's made up his mind to make friends with thee," replied Ben.
"Dang me if he hasn't took a fancy to thee."
"To me?" said Mary, and she moved toward the little tree softly and looked up.
"Would you make friends with me?" she said to the robin just as if she was speaking to a person.
"Would you?"
And she did not say it either in her hard little voice or in her imperious Indian voice, but in a tone so soft and eager and coaxing that Ben Weatherstaff was as surprised as she had been when she heard him whistle.
"Why," he cried out, "tha' said that as nice an' human as if tha' was a real child instead of a sharp old woman.
Tha' said it almost like Dickon talks to his wild things on th' moor."
Mary asked, turning round rather in a hurry.
"Everybody knows him.
Dickon's wanderin' about everywhere.
Th' very blackberries an' heather-bells knows him.
I warrant th' foxes shows him where their cubs lies an' th' skylarks doesn't hide their nests from him."
Mary would have liked to ask some more questions.
She was almost as curious about Dickon as she was about the deserted garden.
But just that moment the robin, who had ended his song, gave a little shake of his wings, spread them and flew away.
He had made his visit and had other things to do.
"He has flown over the wall!" Mary cried out, watching him.
"He has flown into the orchard--he has flown across the other wall--into the garden where there is no door!" "He lives there," said old Ben.
"He came out o' th' egg there.
If he's courtin', he's makin' up to some young madam of a robin that lives among th' old rose-trees there."
"Rose-trees," said Mary.
"Are there rose-trees?"
Ben Weatherstaff took up his spade again and began to dig.
"There was ten year' ago," he mumbled.
"I should like to see them," said Mary.
"Where is the green door?
There must be a door somewhere."
Ben drove his spade deep and looked as uncompanionable as he had looked when she first saw him.
"There was ten year' ago, but there isn't now," he said.
"No door!" cried Mary.
"There must be."
"None as any one can find, an' none as is any one's business.
Don't you be a meddlesome wench an' poke your nose where it's no cause to go.
Here, I must go on with my work.
Get you gone an' play you.
I've no more time."
And he actually stopped digging, threw his spade over his shoulder and walked off, without even glancing at her or saying good-by. &gt;
CHAPTER V THE CRY IN THE CORRlDOR
At first each day which passed by for Mary Lennox was exactly like the others.
Every morning she awoke in her tapestried room and found Martha kneeling upon the hearth building her fire; every morning she ate her breakfast in the nursery which had nothing amusing in it; and after each breakfast she gazed out of the window across to the huge moor which seemed to spread out on all sides and climb up to the sky, and after she had stared for a while she realized that if she did not go out she would have to stay in and do nothing--and so she went out.
She did not know that this was the best thing she could have done, and she did not know that, when she began to walk quickly or even run along the paths and down the avenue, she was stirring her slow blood and making herself stronger by fighting with the wind which swept down from the moor.
She ran only to make herself warm, and she hated the wind which rushed at her face and roared and held her back as if it were some giant she could not see.
But the big breaths of rough fresh air blown over the heather filled her lungs with something which was good for her whole thin body and whipped some red color into her cheeks and brightened her dull eyes when she did not know anything about it.
But after a few days spent almost entirely out of doors she wakened one morning knowing what it was to be hungry, and when she sat down to her breakfast she did not glance disdainfully at her porridge and push it away, but took up her spoon and began to eat it and went on eating it until her bowl was empty.
"Tha' got on well enough with that this mornin', didn't tha'?" said Martha.
"It tastes nice today," said Mary, feeling a little surprised her self.
"It's th' air of th' moor that's givin' thee stomach for tha' victuals," answered
Martha.
"It's lucky for thee that tha's got victuals as well as appetite.
There's been twelve in our cottage as had th' stomach an' nothin' to put in it.
You go on playin' you out o' doors every day an' you'll get some flesh on your bones an' you won't be so yeller." "I don't play," said Mary.
"I have nothing to play with."
"Nothin' to play with!" exclaimed Martha.
"Our children plays with sticks and stones.
They just runs about an' shouts an' looks at things."
Mary did not shout, but she looked at things.
There was nothing else to do.
She walked round and round the gardens and wandered about the paths in the park.
Sometimes she looked for Ben Weatherstaff, but though several times she saw him at work he was too busy to look at her or was too surly.
Once when she was walking toward him he picked up his spade and turned away as if he did it on purpose.
One place she went to oftener than to any other.
It was the long walk outside the gardens with the walls round them.
There were bare flower-beds on either side of it and against the walls ivy grew thickly.
There was one part of the wall where the creeping dark green leaves were more bushy than elsewhere.
It seemed as if for a long time that part had been neglected.
The rest of it had been clipped and made to look neat, but at this lower end of the walk it had not been trimmed at all.
A few days after she had talked to Ben Weatherstaff, Mary stopped to notice this and wondered why it was so.
She had just paused and was looking up at a long spray of ivy swinging in the wind when she saw a gleam of scarlet and heard a brilliant chirp, and there, on the top of the wall, forward perched Ben
Weatherstaff's robin redbreast, tilting forward to look at her with his small head on one side.
"Oh!" she cried out, "is it you--is it you?"
And it did not seem at all queer to her that she spoke to him as if she were sure that he would understand and answer her.
He twittered and chirped and hopped along the wall as if he were telling her all sorts of things.
It seemed to Mistress Mary as if she understood him, too, though he was not speaking in words.
It was as if he said:
"Good morning!
Isn't the wind nice?
Isn't the sun nice?
Isn't everything nice?
Let us both chirp and hop and twitter.
Come on!
Come on!"
Mary began to laugh, and as he hopped and took little flights along the wall she ran after him.
Poor little thin, sallow, ugly Mary--she actually looked almost pretty for a moment.
"I like you!
I like you!" she cried out, pattering down the walk; and she chirped and tried to whistle, which last she did not know how to do in the least.
But the robin seemed to be quite satisfied and chirped and whistled back at her.
At last he spread his wings and made a darting flight to the top of a tree, where he perched and sang loudly.
That reminded Mary of the first time she had seen him.
He had been swinging on a tree-top then and she had been standing in the orchard.
Now she was on the other side of the orchard and standing in the path outside a wall--much lower down--and there was the same tree inside.
"It's in the garden no one can go into," she said to herself.
"It's the garden without a door.
He lives in there.
How I wish I could see what it is like!"
She ran up the walk to the green door she had entered the first morning.
Then she ran down the path through the other door and then into the orchard, and when she stood and looked up there was the tree on the other side of the wall, and there was the robin just finishing his song and, beginning to preen his feathers with his beak.
"It is the garden," she said.
"I am sure it is."
She walked round and looked closely at that side of the orchard wall, but she only found what she had found before--that there was no door in it.
Then she ran through the kitchen-gardens again and out into the walk outside the long ivy-covered wall, and she walked to the end of it and looked at it, but there was no door; and then she walked to the other end, looking again, but there was no door.
"It's very queer," she said.
"Ben Weatherstaff said there was no door and there is no door.
But there must have been one ten years ago, because Mr. Craven buried the key."
This gave her so much to think of that she began to be quite interested and feel that she was not sorry that she had come to Misselthwaite Manor.
In India she had always felt hot and too languid to care much about anything.
The fact was that the fresh wind from the moor had begun to blow the cobwebs out of her young brain and to waken her up a little.
She stayed out of doors nearly all day, and when she sat down to her supper at night she felt hungry and drowsy and comfortable.
She did not feel cross when Martha chattered away.
She felt as if she rather liked to hear her, and at last she thought she would ask her a question.
"Why did Mr. Craven hate the garden?" she said.
She had made Martha stay with her and Martha had not objected at all.
She was very young, and used to a crowded cottage full of brothers and sisters, and she found it dull in the great servants' hall downstairs where the footman and upper-housemaids made fun of her Yorkshire speech and looked upon her as a common little thing, and sat and whispered among themselves.
Martha liked to talk, and the strange child who had lived in India, and been waited upon by "blacks," was novelty enough to attract her.
She sat down on the hearth herself without waiting to be asked.
"Art tha' thinkin' about that garden yet?" she said.
"I knew tha' would.
That was just the way with me when I first heard about it."
"Why did he hate it?" Mary persisted.
Martha tucked her feet under her and made herself quite comfortable.
"Listen to th' wind wutherin' round the house," she said.
"You could bare stand up on the moor if you was out on it tonight."
Mary did not know what "wutherin'" meant until she listened, and then she understood.
It must mean that hollow shuddering sort of roar which rushed round and round the house as if the giant no one could see were buffeting it and beating at the walls and windows to try to break in.
But one knew he could not get in, and somehow it made one feel very safe and warm inside a room with a red coal fire.
"But why did he hate it so?" she asked, after she had listened.
She intended to know if Martha did.
Then Martha gave up her store of knowledge.
"Mind," she said, "Mrs. Medlock said it's not to be talked about.
There's lots o' things in this place that's not to be talked over.
His troubles are none servants' business, he says.
But for th' garden he wouldn't be like he is.
It was Mrs. Craven's garden that she had made when first they were married an' she just loved it, an' they used to 'tend the flowers themselves.
An' none o' th' gardeners was ever let to go in.
Him an' her used to go in an' shut th' door an' stay there hours an' hours, readin' and talkin'.
An' she was just a bit of a girl an' there was an old tree with a branch bent like a seat on it. An' she made roses grow over it an' she used to sit there.
But one day when she was sittin' there th' branch broke an' she fell on th' ground an' was hurt so bad that next day she died.
Th' doctors thought he'd go out o' his mind an' die, too.
That's why he hates it.
No one's never gone in since, an' he won't
let any one talk about it." Mary did not ask any more questions.
She looked at the red fire and listened to the wind "wutherin'."
It seemed to be "wutherin'" louder than ever.
At that moment a very good thing was happening to her.
Four good things had happened to her, in fact, since she came to Misselthwaite
Manor.
She had felt as if she had understood a robin and that he had understood her; she had run in the wind until her blood had grown warm; she had been healthily hungry for the first time in her life; and she had found out what it was to be sorry for some one.
But as she was listening to the wind she began to listen to something else.
She did not know what it was, because at first she could scarcely distinguish it from the wind itself.
It was a curious sound--it seemed almost as if a child were crying somewhere.
Sometimes the wind sounded rather like a child crying, but presently Mistress Mary felt quite sure this sound was inside the house, not outside it.
It was far away, but it was inside.
She turned round and looked at Martha.
"Do you hear any one crying?" she said.
Martha suddenly looked confused.
"No," she answered.
"It's th' wind.
Sometimes it sounds like as if some one was lost on th' moor an' wailin'.
It's got all sorts o' sounds." "But listen," said Mary.
"It's in the house--down one of those long corridors."
And at that very moment a door must have been opened somewhere downstairs; for a great rushing draft blew along the passage and the door of the room they sat in was blown open with a crash, and as they both jumped to their feet the light was blown out and the crying sound was swept down the far corridor so that it was to be heard more plainly than ever.
"There!" said Mary.
"I told you so!
It is some one crying--and it isn't a grown-up person."
Martha ran and shut the door and turned the key, but before she did it they both heard the sound of a door in some far passage shutting with a bang, and then everything was quiet, for even the wind ceased "wutherin'" for a few moments.
"It was th' wind," said Martha stubbornly.
"An' if it wasn't, it was little Betty
Butterworth, th' scullery-maid.
She's had th' toothache all day."
But something troubled and awkward in her manner made Mistress Mary stare very hard at her.
She did not believe she was speaking the truth. &gt;
CHAPTER VI "THERE WAS SOME ONE CRYlNG--THERE WAS!"
The next day the rain poured down in torrents again, and when Mary looked out of her window the moor was almost hidden by gray mist and cloud.
There could be no going out today.
"What do you do in your cottage when it rains like this?" she asked Martha.
"Try to keep from under each other's feet mostly," Martha answered.
"Eh! there does seem a lot of us then.
Mother's a good-tempered woman but she gets fair moithered.
The biggest ones goes out in th' cow-shed and plays there.
Dickon he doesn't mind th' wet.
He goes out just th' same as if th' sun was shinin'.
He says he sees things on rainy days as doesn't show when it's fair weather.
He once found a little fox cub half drowned in its hole and he brought it home in th' bosom of his shirt to keep it warm.
Its mother had been killed nearby an' th' hole was swum out an' th' rest o' th' litter was dead.
He's got it at home now.
He found a half-drowned young crow another time an' he brought it home, too, an' tamed it.
It's named Soot because it's so black, an' it hops an' flies about with him everywhere."
The time had come when Mary had forgotten to resent Martha's familiar talk.
She had even begun to find it interesting and to be sorry when she stopped or went away.
The stories she had been told by her Ayah when she lived in India had been quite unlike those Martha had to tell about the moorland cottage which held fourteen people who lived in four little rooms and never had quite enough to eat.
The children seemed to tumble about and amuse themselves like a litter of rough, good-natured collie puppies.
Mary was most attracted by the mother and Dickon.
When Martha told stories of what "mother" said or did they always sounded comfortable.
"If I had a raven or a fox cub I could play with it," said Mary.
"But I have nothing." Martha looked perplexed.
"Can tha' knit?" she asked.
"No," answered Mary.
"Can tha' sew?"
"No." "Can tha' read?"
"Yes."
"Then why doesn't tha, read somethin', or learn a bit o' spellin'?
Tha'st old enough to be learnin' thy book a good bit now."
"I haven't any books," said Mary.
"Those I had were left in India." "That's a pity," said Martha.
"If Mrs. Medlock'd let thee go into th' library, there's thousands o' books there."
Mary did not ask where the library was, because she was suddenly inspired by a new idea.
She made up her mind to go and find it herself.
She was not troubled about Mrs. Medlock.
Mrs. Medlock seemed always to be in her comfortable housekeeper's sitting-room downstairs.
In this queer place one scarcely ever saw any one at all.
In fact, there was no one to see but the servants, and when their master was away they lived a luxurious life below stairs, where there was a huge kitchen hung about with shining brass and pewter, and a large servants' hall where there were four or five abundant meals eaten every day, and where a great deal of lively romping went on when Mrs. Medlock was out of the way.
Mary's meals were served regularly, and Martha waited on her, but no one troubled themselves about her in the least.
Mrs. Medlock came and looked at her every day or two, but no one inquired what she did or told her what to do.
She supposed that perhaps this was the
English way of treating children.
In India she had always been attended by her Ayah, who had followed her about and waited on her, hand and foot.
She had often been tired of her company.
Now she was followed by nobody and was learning to dress herself because Martha looked as though she thought she was silly and stupid when she wanted to have things handed to her and put on.
"Hasn't tha' got good sense?" she said once, when Mary had stood waiting for her to put on her gloves for her.
"Our Susan Ann is twice as sharp as thee an' she's only four year' old.
Sometimes tha' looks fair soft in th' head."
Mary had worn her contrary scowl for an hour after that, but it made her think several entirely new things.
She stood at the window for about ten minutes this morning after Martha had swept up the hearth for the last time and gone downstairs.
She was thinking over the new idea which had come to her when she heard of the
library.
She did not care very much about the library itself, because she had read very few books; but to hear of it brought back to her mind the hundred rooms with closed doors.
She wondered if they were all really locked and what she would find if she could get into any of them.
Were there a hundred really?
Why shouldn't she go and see how many doors she could count?
It would be something to do on this morning when she could not go out.
She had never been taught to ask permission to do things, and she knew nothing at all about authority, so she would not have thought it necessary to ask Mrs. Medlock if she might walk about the house, even if she had seen her.
She opened the door of the room and went into the corridor, and then she began her wanderings.
It was a long corridor and it branched into other corridors and it led her up short flights of steps which mounted to others again.
There were doors and doors, and there were pictures on the walls.
Sometimes they were pictures of dark, curious landscapes, but oftenest they were portraits of men and women in queer, grand costumes made of satin and velvet.
She found herself in one long gallery whose walls were covered with these portraits.
She had never thought there could be so many in any house.
She walked slowly down this place and stared at the faces which also seemed to stare at her.
She felt as if they were wondering what a little girl from India was doing in their house.
Some were pictures of children--little girls in thick satin frocks which reached to their feet and stood out about them, and boys with puffed sleeves and lace collars and long hair, or with big ruffs around their necks.
She always stopped to look at the children, and wonder what their names were, and where they had gone, and why they wore such odd clothes.
There was a stiff, plain little girl rather like herself.
She wore a green brocade dress and held a green parrot on her finger.
Her eyes had a sharp, curious look.
"Where do you live now?" said Mary aloud to her.
"I wish you were here." Surely no other little girl ever spent such a queer morning.
It seemed as if there was no one in all the huge rambling house but her own small self, wandering about upstairs and down, through narrow passages and wide ones, where it seemed to her that no one but herself had ever walked.
Since so many rooms had been built, people must have lived in them, but it all seemed so empty that she could not quite believe it true.
It was not until she climbed to the second floor that she thought of turning the handle of a door.
All the doors were shut, as Mrs. Medlock had said they were, but at last she put her hand on the handle of one of them and turned it.
She was almost frightened for a moment when she felt that it turned without difficulty and that when she pushed upon the door itself it slowly and heavily opened.
It was a massive door and opened into a big bedroom.
There were embroidered hangings on the wall, and inlaid furniture such as she had seen in India stood about the room.
A broad window with leaded panes looked out upon the moor; and over the mantel was another portrait of the stiff, plain little girl who seemed to stare at her more curiously than ever.
"Perhaps she slept here once," said Mary.
"She stares at me so that she makes me feel queer."
After that she opened more doors and more.
She saw so many rooms that she became quite tired and began to think that there must be a hundred, though she had not counted them.
In all of them there were old pictures or old tapestries with strange scenes worked on them.
There were curious pieces of furniture and curious ornaments in nearly all of them.
In one room, which looked like a lady's sitting-room, the hangings were all embroidered velvet, and in a cabinet were about a hundred little elephants made of ivory.
They were of different sizes, and some had their mahouts or palanquins on their backs.
Some were much bigger than the others and some were so tiny that they seemed only babies.
Mary had seen carved ivory in India and she knew all about elephants.
She opened the door of the cabinet and stood on a footstool and played with these for quite a long time.
When she got tired she set the elephants in order and shut the door of the cabinet.
In all her wanderings through the long corridors and the empty rooms, she had seen nothing alive; but in this room she saw something.
Just after she had closed the cabinet door she heard a tiny rustling sound.
It made her jump and look around at the sofa by the fireplace, from which it seemed to come.
In the corner of the sofa there was a cushion, and in the velvet which covered it there was a hole, and out of the hole peeped a tiny head with a pair of frightened eyes in it.
Mary crept softly across the room to look.
The bright eyes belonged to a little gray mouse, and the mouse had eaten a hole into the cushion and made a comfortable nest there.
Six baby mice were cuddled up asleep near her.
If there was no one else alive in the hundred rooms there were seven mice who did not look lonely at all.
"If they wouldn't be so frightened I would take them back with me," said Mary.
She had wandered about long enough to feel too tired to wander any farther, and she turned back.
Two or three times she lost her way by turning down the wrong corridor and was obliged to ramble up and down until she found the right one; but at last she reached her own floor again, though she was some distance from her own room and did not know exactly where she was.
"I believe I have taken a wrong turning again," she said, standing still at what seemed the end of a short passage with tapestry on the wall.
"I don't know which way to go.
How still everything is!"
It was while she was standing here and just after she had said this that the stillness was broken by a sound.
It was another cry, but not quite like the one she had heard last night; it was only a short one, a fretful childish whine muffled by passing through walls.
"It's nearer than it was," said Mary, her heart beating rather faster.
"And it is crying."
She put her hand accidentally upon the tapestry near her, and then sprang back, feeling quite startled.
The tapestry was the covering of a door which fell open and showed her that there was another part of the corridor behind it, and Mrs. Medlock was coming up it with her bunch of keys in her hand and a very cross look on her face.
"What are you doing here?" she said, and she took Mary by the arm and pulled her away.
"What did I tell you?" "I turned round the wrong corner," explained Mary.
"I didn't know which way to go and I heard some one crying."
She quite hated Mrs. Medlock at the moment, but she hated her more the next.
"You didn't hear anything of the sort," said the housekeeper.
"You come along back to your own nursery or I'll box your ears."
And she took her by the arm and half pushed, half pulled her up one passage and down another until she pushed her in at the door of her own room.
"Now," she said, "you stay where you're told to stay or you'll find yourself locked up.
The master had better get you a governess, same as he said he would.
You're one that needs some one to look sharp after you.
I've got enough to do."
She went out of the room and slammed the door after her, and Mary went and sat on the hearth-rug, pale with rage.
She did not cry, but ground her teeth.
"There was some one crying--there was-- there was!" she said to herself.
She had heard it twice now, and sometime she would find out.
She had found out a great deal this morning.
She felt as if she had been on a long journey, and at any rate she had had something to amuse her all the time, and she had played with the ivory elephants and had seen the gray mouse and its babies in their nest in the velvet cushion. &gt;
CHAPTER VII THE KEY TO THE GARDEN
Two days after this, when Mary opened her eyes she sat upright in bed immediately, and called to Martha.
"Look at the moor!
Look at the moor!"
The rainstorm had ended and the gray mist and clouds had been swept away in the night by the wind.
The wind itself had ceased and a brilliant, deep blue sky arched high over the moorland.
Never, never had Mary dreamed of a sky so blue.
In India skies were hot and blazing; this was of a deep cool blue which almost seemed to sparkle like the waters of some lovely bottomless lake, and here and there, high, high in the arched blueness floated small clouds of snow-white fleece.
The far-reaching world of the moor itself looked softly blue instead of gloomy purple-black or awful dreary gray.
"Aye," said Martha with a cheerful grin.
"Th' storm's over for a bit.
It does like this at this time o' th' year.
It goes off in a night like it was pretendin' it had never been here an' never meant to come again.
That's because th' springtime's on its way.
It's a long way off yet, but it's comin'."
"I thought perhaps it always rained or looked dark in England," Mary said.
"Eh! no!" said Martha, sitting up on her heels among her black lead brushes.
"Nowt o' th' soart!"
"What does that mean?" asked Mary seriously.
In India the natives spoke different dialects which only a few people understood, so she was not surprised when Martha used words she did not know.
Martha laughed as she had done the first morning.
"There now," she said.
"I've talked broad Yorkshire again like
Mrs. Medlock said I mustn't.
'Nowt o' th' soart' means 'nothin'-of-the- sort,'" slowly and carefully, "but it takes so long to say it.
Yorkshire's th' sunniest place on earth when it is sunny.
I told thee tha'd like th' moor after a bit.
Just you wait till you see th' gold-colored gorse blossoms an' th' blossoms o' th' broom, an' th' heather flowerin', all purple bells, an' hundreds o' butterflies flutterin' an' bees hummin' an' skylarks soarin' up an' singin'.
You'll want to get out on it as sunrise an' live out on it all day like Dickon does."
"Could I ever get there?" asked Mary wistfully, looking through her window at the far-off blue.
It was so new and big and wonderful and such a heavenly color.
"I don't know," answered Martha.
"Tha's never used tha' legs since tha' was born, it seems to me.
Tha' couldn't walk five mile.
It's five mile to our cottage."
"I should like to see your cottage." Martha stared at her a moment curiously before she took up her polishing brush and began to rub the grate again.
She was thinking that the small plain face did not look quite as sour at this moment as it had done the first morning she saw it.
It looked just a trifle like little Susan Ann's when she wanted something very much.
"I'll ask my mother about it," she said.
"She's one o' them that nearly always sees a way to do things.
It's my day out today an' I'm goin' home.
Eh!
I am glad.
Mrs. Medlock thinks a lot o' mother.
Perhaps she could talk to her."
"I like your mother," said Mary.
"I should think tha' did," agreed Martha, polishing away.
"I've never seen her," said Mary.
"No, tha' hasn't," replied Martha.
She sat up on her heels again and rubbed the end of her nose with the back of her hand as if puzzled for a moment, but she ended quite positively.
"Well, she's that sensible an' hard workin' an' goodnatured an' clean that no one could help likin' her whether they'd seen her or not.
When I'm goin' home to her on my day out I just jump for joy when I'm crossin' the moor." "I like Dickon," added Mary.
"And I've never seen him."
"Well," said Martha stoutly, "I've told thee that th' very birds likes him an' th' rabbits an' wild sheep an' ponies, an' th' foxes themselves.
I wonder," staring at her reflectively, "what Dickon would think of thee?"
"He wouldn't like me," said Mary in her stiff, cold little way.
"No one does."
Martha looked reflective again.
"How does tha' like thysel'?" she inquired, really quite as if she were curious to know.
Mary hesitated a moment and thought it over.
"Not at all--really," she answered.
"But I never thought of that before."
Martha grinned a little as if at some homely recollection.
"Mother said that to me once," she said.
"She was at her wash-tub an' I was in a bad temper an' talkin' ill of folk, an' she turns round on me an' says:
'Tha' young vixen, tha'!
There tha' stands sayin' tha' doesn't like this one an' tha' doesn't like that one.
How does tha' like thysel'?'
It made me laugh an' it brought me to my senses in a minute."
She went away in high spirits as soon as she had given Mary her breakfast.
She was going to walk five miles across the moor to the cottage, and she was going to help her mother with the washing and do the week's baking and enjoy herself thoroughly.
Mary felt lonelier than ever when she knew she was no longer in the house.
She went out into the garden as quickly as possible, and the first thing she did was to run round and round the fountain flower garden ten times.
She counted the times carefully and when she had finished she felt in better spirits. The sunshine made the whole place look different.
The high, deep, blue sky arched over Misselthwaite as well as over the moor, and she kept lifting her face and looking up into it, trying to imagine what it would be like to lie down on one of the little snow- white clouds and float about.
She went into the first kitchen-garden and found Ben Weatherstaff working there with two other gardeners.
The change in the weather seemed to have done him good.
He spoke to her of his own accord.
"Springtime's comin,'" he said.
"Cannot tha' smell it?"
Mary sniffed and thought she could.
"I smell something nice and fresh and damp," she said.
"That's th' good rich earth," he answered, digging away.
"It's in a good humor makin' ready to grow things.
It's glad when plantin' time comes.
It's dull in th' winter when it's got nowt to do.
In th' flower gardens out there things will be stirrin' down below in th' dark.
Th' sun's warmin' 'em.
You'll see bits o' green spikes stickin' out o' th' black earth after a bit."
"What will they be?" asked Mary.
"Crocuses an' snowdrops an' daffydowndillys.
Has tha' never seen them?"
"No.
Everything is hot, and wet, and green after the rains in India," said Mary.
"And I think things grow up in a night." "These won't grow up in a night," said
Weatherstaff.
"Tha'll have to wait for 'em.
They'll poke up a bit higher here, an' push out a spike more there, an' uncurl a leaf this day an' another that.
You watch 'em."
"I am going to," answered Mary.
Very soon she heard the soft rustling flight of wings again and she knew at once that the robin had come again.
He was very pert and lively, and hopped about so close to her feet, and put his head on one side and looked at her so slyly that she asked Ben Weatherstaff a question.
"Do you think he remembers me?" she said.
"Remembers thee!" said Weatherstaff indignantly.
"He knows every cabbage stump in th' gardens, let alone th' people.
He's never seen a little wench here before, an' he's bent on findin' out all about thee.
Tha's no need to try to hide anything from him."
"Are things stirring down below in the dark in that garden where he lives?"
"What garden?" grunted Weatherstaff, becoming surly again.
"The one where the old rose-trees are." She could not help asking, because she wanted so much to know.
"Are all the flowers dead, or do some of them come again in the summer?
Are there ever any roses?" "Ask him," said Ben Weatherstaff, hunching his shoulders toward the robin. "He's the only one as knows.
No one else has seen inside it for ten year'."
Ten years was a long time, Mary thought.
She had been born ten years ago.
She walked away, slowly thinking.
She had begun to like the garden just as she had begun to like the robin and Dickon and Martha's mother.
She was beginning to like Martha, too.
That seemed a good many people to like-- when you were not used to liking.
She thought of the robin as one of the people.
She went to her walk outside the long, ivy- covered wall over which she could see the tree-tops; and the second time she walked up and down the most interesting and exciting thing happened to her, and it was all through Ben Weatherstaff's robin.
She heard a chirp and a twitter, and when she looked at the bare flower-bed at her left side there he was hopping about and pretending to peck things out of the earth to persuade her that he had not followed her.
But she knew he had followed her and the surprise so filled her with delight that she almost trembled a little.
"You do remember me!" she cried out.
"You do!
You are prettier than anything else in the world!"
She chirped, and talked, and coaxed and he hopped, and flirted his tail and twittered.
It was as if he were talking.
His red waistcoat was like satin and he puffed his tiny breast out and was so fine and so grand and so pretty that it was really as if he were showing her how important and like a human person a robin could be.
Mistress Mary forgot that she had ever been contrary in her life when he allowed her to draw closer and closer to him, and bend down and talk and try to make something like robin sounds.
Oh! to think that he should actually let her come as near to him as that!
He knew nothing in the world would make her put out her hand toward him or startle him in the least tiniest way.
He knew it because he was a real person-- only nicer than any other person in the world.
She was so happy that she scarcely dared to breathe.
The flower-bed was not quite bare.
It was bare of flowers because the perennial plants had been cut down for their winter rest, but there were tall shrubs and low ones which grew together at the back of the bed, and as the robin hopped about under them she saw him hop over a small pile of freshly turned up earth.
He stopped on it to look for a worm.
The earth had been turned up because a dog had been trying to dig up a mole and he had scratched quite a deep hole.
Mary looked at it, not really knowing why the hole was there, and as she looked she saw something almost buried in the newly- turned soil.
It was something like a ring of rusty iron or brass and when the robin flew up into a tree nearby she put out her hand and picked the ring up.
It was more than a ring, however; it was an old key which looked as if it had been buried a long time.
Mistress Mary stood up and looked at it with an almost frightened face as it hung from her finger.
"Perhaps it has been buried for ten years," she said in a whisper.
"Perhaps it is the key to the garden!" &gt;
CHAPTER Vill THE ROBlN WHO SHOWED THE WAY
She looked at the key quite a long time.
She turned it over and over, and thought about it.
As I have said before, she was not a child who had been trained to ask permission or consult her elders about things.
All she thought about the key was that if it was the key to the closed garden, and she could find out where the door was, she could perhaps open it and see what was inside the walls, and what had happened to the old rose-trees.
It was because it had been shut up so long that she wanted to see it.
It seemed as if it must be different from other places and that something strange must have happened to it during ten years.
Besides that, if she liked it she could go into it every day and shut the door behind her, and she could make up some play of her own and play it quite alone, because nobody would ever know where she was, but would think the door was still locked and the key buried in the earth.
The thought of that pleased her very much.
Living as it were, all by herself in a house with a hundred mysteriously closed rooms and having nothing whatever to do to amuse herself, had set her inactive brain to working and was actually awakening her imagination.
There is no doubt that the fresh, strong, pure air from the moor had a great deal to do with it.
Just as it had given her an appetite, and fighting with the wind had stirred her blood, so the same things had stirred her mind.
In India she had always been too hot and languid and weak to care much about anything, but in this place she was beginning to care and to want to do new things.
Already she felt less "contrary," though she did not know why.
She put the key in her pocket and walked up and down her walk.
No one but herself ever seemed to come there, so she could walk slowly and look at the wall, or, rather, at the ivy growing on it.
The ivy was the baffling thing.
Howsoever carefully she looked she could see nothing but thickly growing, glossy, dark green leaves.
She was very much disappointed.
Something of her contrariness came back to her as she paced the walk and looked over it at the tree-tops inside.
It seemed so silly, she said to herself, to be near it and not be able to get in.
She took the key in her pocket when she went back to the house, and she made up her mind that she would always carry it with her when she went out, so that if she ever should find the hidden door she would be ready.
Mrs. Medlock had allowed Martha to sleep all night at the cottage, but she was back at her work in the morning with cheeks redder than ever and in the best of spirits.
"I got up at four o'clock," she said.
"Eh! it was pretty on th' moor with th' birds gettin' up an' th' rabbits scamperin' about an' th' sun risin'.
I didn't walk all th' way.
A man gave me a ride in his cart an' I did enjoy myself."
She was full of stories of the delights of her day out.
Her mother had been glad to see her and they had got the baking and washing all out of the way.
She had even made each of the children a doughcake with a bit of brown sugar in it.
"I had 'em all pipin' hot when they came in from playin' on th' moor.
An' th' cottage all smelt o' nice, clean hot bakin' an' there was a good fire, an' they just shouted for joy.
Our Dickon he said our cottage was good enough for a king."
In the evening they had all sat round the fire, and Martha and her mother had sewed patches on torn clothes and mended stockings and Martha had told them about the little girl who had come from India and who had been waited on all her life by what Martha called "blacks" until she didn't know how to put on her own stockings.
"Eh! they did like to hear about you," said
Martha.
"They wanted to know all about th' blacks an' about th' ship you came in.
I couldn't tell 'em enough."
Mary reflected a little.
"I'll tell you a great deal more before your next day out," she said, "so that you will have more to talk about.
I dare say they would like to hear about riding on elephants and camels, and about the officers going to hunt tigers." "My word!" cried delighted Martha.
"It would set 'em clean off their heads.
It would be same as a wild beast show like we heard they had in York once."
"India is quite different from Yorkshire," Mary said slowly, as she thought the matter over.
"I never thought of that.
Did Dickon and your mother like to hear you talk about me?"
"Why, our Dickon's eyes nearly started out o' his head, they got that round," answered
Martha.
"But mother, she was put out about your seemin' to be all by yourself like.
She said, 'Hasn't Mr. Craven got no governess for her, nor no nurse?' and I said, 'No, he hasn't, though Mrs. Medlock says he will when he thinks of it, but she says he mayn't think of it for two or three years.'"
"I don't want a governess," said Mary sharply.
"But mother says you ought to be learnin' your book by this time an' you ought to have a woman to look after you, an' she says:
'Now, Martha, you just think how you'd feel yourself, in a big place like that, wanderin' about all alone, an' no mother.
You do your best to cheer her up,' she says, an' I said I would."
Mary gave her a long, steady look.
"You do cheer me up," she said.
"I like to hear you talk."
Presently Martha went out of the room and came back with something held in her hands under her apron.
"What does tha' think," she said, with a cheerful grin.
"I've brought thee a present." "A present!" exclaimed Mistress Mary.
How could a cottage full of fourteen hungry people give any one a present!
"A man was drivin' across the moor peddlin'," Martha explained.
"An' he stopped his cart at our door.
He had pots an' pans an' odds an' ends, but mother had no money to buy anythin'.
Just as he was goin' away our 'Lizabeth Ellen called out, 'Mother, he's got skippin'-ropes with red an' blue handles.'
An' mother she calls out quite sudden, 'Here, stop, mister!
How much are they?'
An' he says 'Tuppence', an' mother she began fumblin' in her pocket an' she says to me, 'Martha, tha's brought me thy wages like a good lass, an' I've got four places to put every penny, but I'm just goin' to take tuppence out of it to buy that child a skippin'-rope,' an' she bought one an' here it is." She brought it out from under her apron and exhibited it quite proudly.
It was a strong, slender rope with a striped red and blue handle at each end, but Mary Lennox had never seen a skipping- rope before.
She gazed at it with a mystified expression.
"What is it for?" she asked curiously.
"For!" cried out Martha.
"Does tha' mean that they've not got skippin'-ropes in India, for all they've got elephants and tigers and camels!
No wonder most of 'em's black.
This is what it's for; just watch me."
And she ran into the middle of the room and, taking a handle in each hand, began to skip, and skip, and skip, while Mary turned in her chair to stare at her, and the queer faces in the old portraits seemed to stare at her, too, and wonder what on earth this common little cottager had the impudence to be doing under their very noses.
But Martha did not even see them.
The interest and curiosity in Mistress Mary's face delighted her, and she went on skipping and counted as she skipped until she had reached a hundred.
"I could skip longer than that," she said when she stopped.
"I've skipped as much as five hundred when I was twelve, but I wasn't as fat then as I am now, an' I was in practice."
Mary got up from her chair beginning to feel excited herself.
"It looks nice," she said.
"Your mother is a kind woman.
Do you think I could ever skip like that?"
"You just try it," urged Martha, handing her the skipping-rope.
"You can't skip a hundred at first, but if you practice you'll mount up.
That's what mother said.
She says, 'Nothin' will do her more good than skippin' rope.
It's th' sensiblest toy a child can have.
Let her play out in th' fresh air skippin' an' it'll stretch her legs an' arms an' give her some strength in 'em.'"
It was plain that there was not a great deal of strength in Mistress Mary's arms and legs when she first began to skip.
She was not very clever at it, but she liked it so much that she did not want to stop.
"Put on tha' things and run an' skip out o' doors," said Martha.
"Mother said I must tell you to keep out o' doors as much as you could, even when it rains a bit, so as tha' wrap up warm."
Mary put on her coat and hat and took her skipping-rope over her arm.
She opened the door to go out, and then suddenly thought of something and turned back rather slowly.
"Martha," she said, "they were your wages.
It was your two-pence really.
Thank you."
She said it stiffly because she was not used to thanking people or noticing that they did things for her.
"Thank you," she said, and held out her hand because she did not know what else to do.
Martha gave her hand a clumsy little shake, as if she was not accustomed to this sort of thing either.
Then she laughed.
"Eh! th' art a queer, old-womanish thing," she said.
"If tha'd been our 'Lizabeth Ellen tha'd have given me a kiss."
Mary looked stiffer than ever.
"Do you want me to kiss you?" Martha laughed again.
"Nay, not me," she answered. "If tha' was different, p'raps tha'd want to thysel'.
But tha' isn't.
Run off outside an' play with thy rope."
Mistress Mary felt a little awkward as she went out of the room.
Yorkshire people seemed strange, and Martha was always rather a puzzle to her.
At first she had disliked her very much, but now she did not.
The skipping-rope was a wonderful thing.
She counted and skipped, and skipped and counted, until her cheeks were quite red, and she was more interested than she had ever been since she was born.
The sun was shining and a little wind was blowing--not a rough wind, but one which came in delightful little gusts and brought a fresh scent of newly turned earth with it.
She skipped round the fountain garden, and up one walk and down another.
She skipped at last into the kitchen-garden and saw Ben Weatherstaff digging and talking to his robin, which was hopping about him.
She skipped down the walk toward him and he lifted his head and looked at her with a curious expression.
She had wondered if he would notice her.
She wanted him to see her skip.
"Well!" he exclaimed.
"Upon my word.
P'raps tha' art a young 'un, after all, an' p'raps tha's got child's blood in thy veins instead of sour buttermilk.
Tha's skipped red into thy cheeks as sure as my name's Ben Weatherstaff.
I wouldn't have believed tha' could do it." "I never skipped before," Mary said.
"I'm just beginning.
I can only go up to twenty." "Tha' keep on," said Ben.
"Tha' shapes well enough at it for a young 'un that's lived with heathen.
Just see how he's watchin' thee," jerking his head toward the robin.
"He followed after thee yesterday.
He'll be at it again today.
He'll be bound to find out what th' skippin'-rope is.
He's never seen one. Eh!" shaking his head at the bird, "tha' curiosity will be th' death of thee sometime if tha' doesn't look sharp."
Mary skipped round all the gardens and round the orchard, resting every few minutes.
At length she went to her own special walk and made up her mind to try if she could skip the whole length of it.
It was a good long skip and she began slowly, but before she had gone half-way down the path she was so hot and breathless that she was obliged to stop.
She did not mind much, because she had already counted up to thirty.
She stopped with a little laugh of pleasure, and there, lo and behold, was the robin swaying on a long branch of ivy.
He had followed her and he greeted her with a chirp.
As Mary had skipped toward him she felt something heavy in her pocket strike against her at each jump, and when she saw the robin she laughed again.
"You showed me where the key was yesterday," she said.
"You ought to show me the door today; but I don't believe you know!"
The robin flew from his swinging spray of ivy on to the top of the wall and he opened his beak and sang a loud, lovely trill, merely to show off.
Nothing in the world is quite as adorably lovely as a robin when he shows off--and they are nearly always doing it.
Mary Lennox had heard a great deal about Magic in her Ayah's stories, and she always said that what happened almost at that moment was Magic.
One of the nice little gusts of wind rushed down the walk, and it was a stronger one than the rest.
It was strong enough to wave the branches of the trees, and it was more than strong enough to sway the trailing sprays of untrimmed ivy hanging from the wall.
Mary had stepped close to the robin, and suddenly the gust of wind swung aside some loose ivy trails, and more suddenly still she jumped toward it and caught it in her hand.
This she did because she had seen something under it--a round knob which had been covered by the leaves hanging over it.
It was the knob of a door.
She put her hands under the leaves and began to pull and push them aside.
Thick as the ivy hung, it nearly all was a loose and swinging curtain, though some had crept over wood and iron.
Mary's heart began to thump and her hands to shake a little in her delight and excitement.
The robin kept singing and twittering away and tilting his head on one side, as if he were as excited as she was.
What was this under her hands which was square and made of iron and which her fingers found a hole in?
It was the lock of the door which had been closed ten years and she put her hand in her pocket, drew out the key and found it fitted the keyhole.
She put the key in and turned it.
It took two hands to do it, but it did turn.
And then she took a long breath and looked behind her up the long walk to see if any one was coming.
No one was coming.
No one ever did come, it seemed, and she took another long breath, because she could not help it, and she held back the swinging curtain of ivy and pushed back the door which opened slowly--slowly.
Then she slipped through it, and shut it behind her, and stood with her back against it, looking about her and breathing quite fast with excitement, and wonder, and delight.
She was standing inside the secret garden. &gt;
CHAPTER IX THE STRANGEST HOUSE ANY ONE EVER LlVED IN
It was the sweetest, most mysterious- looking place any one could imagine.
The high walls which shut it in were covered with the leafless stems of climbing roses which were so thick that they were matted together.
Mary Lennox knew they were roses because she had seen a great many roses in India.
All the ground was covered with grass of a wintry brown and out of it grew clumps of bushes which were surely rosebushes if they were alive.
There were numbers of standard roses which had so spread their branches that they were
There were other trees in the garden, and one of the things which made the place look strangest and loveliest was that climbing roses had run all over them and swung down long tendrils which made light swaying curtains, and here and there they had caught at each other or at a far-reaching branch and had crept from one tree to another and made lovely bridges of themselves.
There were neither leaves nor roses on them now and Mary did not know whether they were dead or alive, but their thin gray or brown branches and sprays looked like a sort of hazy mantle spreading over everything, walls, and trees, and even brown grass, where they had fallen from their fastenings and run along the ground.
It was this hazy tangle from tree to tree which made it all look so mysterious.
Mary had thought it must be different from other gardens which had not been left all by themselves so long; and indeed it was different from any other place she had ever seen in her life.
"How still it is!" she whispered.
"How still!"
Then she waited a moment and listened at the stillness.
The robin, who had flown to his treetop, was still as all the rest.
He did not even flutter his wings; he sat without stirring, and looked at Mary.
"No wonder it is still," she whispered again.
"I am the first person who has spoken in here for ten years."
She moved away from the door, stepping as softly as if she were afraid of awakening some one.
She was glad that there was grass under her feet and that her steps made no sounds.
She walked under one of the fairy-like gray arches between the trees and looked up at the sprays and tendrils which formed them.
"I wonder if they are all quite dead," she said.
"Is it all a quite dead garden?
I wish it wasn't."
If she had been Ben Weatherstaff she could have told whether the wood was alive by looking at it, but she could only see that there were only gray or brown sprays and branches and none showed any signs of even a tiny leaf-bud anywhere.
But she was inside the wonderful garden and she could come through the door under the ivy any time and she felt as if she had found a world all her own.
The sun was shining inside the four walls and the high arch of blue sky over this particular piece of Misselthwaite seemed even more brilliant and soft than it was over the moor.
The robin flew down from his tree-top and hopped about or flew after her from one bush to another.
He chirped a good deal and had a very busy air, as if he were showing her things.
Everything was strange and silent and she seemed to be hundreds of miles away from any one, but somehow she did not feel lonely at all.
All that troubled her was her wish that she knew whether all the roses were dead, or if perhaps some of them had lived and might put out leaves and buds as the weather got warmer.
She did not want it to be a quite dead garden.
If it were a quite alive garden, how wonderful it would be, and what thousands of roses would grow on every side!
Her skipping-rope had hung over her arm when she came in and after she had walked about for a while she thought she would skip round the whole garden, stopping when she wanted to look at things.
There seemed to have been grass paths here and there, and in one or two corners there were alcoves of evergreen with stone seats or tall moss-covered flower urns in them.
As she came near the second of these alcoves she stopped skipping.
There had once been a flowerbed in it, and she thought she saw something sticking out of the black earth--some sharp little pale green points.
She remembered what Ben Weatherstaff had said and she knelt down to look at them.
"Yes, they are tiny growing things and they might be crocuses or snowdrops or daffodils," she whispered.
She bent very close to them and sniffed the fresh scent of the damp earth.
She liked it very much.
"Perhaps there are some other ones coming up in other places," she said.
"I will go all over the garden and look." She did not skip, but walked.
She went slowly and kept her eyes on the ground.
She looked in the old border beds and among the grass, and after she had gone round, trying to miss nothing, she had found ever so many more sharp, pale green points, and she had become quite excited again.
"It isn't a quite dead garden," she cried out softly to herself.
"Even if the roses are dead, there are other things alive."
She did not know anything about gardening, but the grass seemed so thick in some of the places where the green points were pushing their way through that she thought they did not seem to have room enough to grow.
She searched about until she found a rather sharp piece of wood and knelt down and dug and weeded out the weeds and grass until she made nice little clear places around them.
"Now they look as if they could breathe," she said, after she had finished with the first ones.
"I am going to do ever so many more.
I'll do all I can see.
If I haven't time today I can come tomorrow."
She went from place to place, and dug and weeded, and enjoyed herself so immensely that she was led on from bed to bed and into the grass under the trees.
The exercise made her so warm that she first threw her coat off, and then her hat, and without knowing it she was smiling down on to the grass and the pale green points all the time.
The robin was tremendously busy.
He was very much pleased to see gardening begun on his own estate.
He had often wondered at Ben Weatherstaff.
Where gardening is done all sorts of delightful things to eat are turned up with the soil.
Now here was this new kind of creature who was not half Ben's size and yet had had the sense to come into his garden and begin at once.
Mistress Mary worked in her garden until it was time to go to her midday dinner.
In fact, she was rather late in remembering, and when she put on her coat and hat, and picked up her skipping-rope, she could not believe that she had been working two or three hours.
She had been actually happy all the time; and dozens and dozens of the tiny, pale green points were to be seen in cleared places, looking twice as cheerful as they had looked before when the grass and weeds had been smothering them.
"I shall come back this afternoon," she said, looking all round at her new kingdom, and speaking to the trees and the rose- bushes as if they heard her.
Then she ran lightly across the grass, pushed open the slow old door and slipped through it under the ivy.
She had such red cheeks and such bright eyes and ate such a dinner that Martha was delighted.
"Two pieces o' meat an' two helps o' rice puddin'!" she said.
"Eh! mother will be pleased when I tell her what th' skippin'-rope's done for thee."
In the course of her digging with her pointed stick Mistress Mary had found herself digging up a sort of white root rather like an onion.
She had put it back in its place and patted the earth carefully down on it and just now she wondered if Martha could tell her what it was.
"Martha," she said, "what are those white roots that look like onions?"
"They're bulbs," answered Martha.
"Lots o' spring flowers grow from 'em.
Th' very little ones are snowdrops an' crocuses an' th' big ones are narcissuses an' jonquils and daffydowndillys.
Th' biggest of all is lilies an' purple flags.
Eh! they are nice. Dickon's got a whole lot of 'em planted in our bit o' garden." "Does Dickon know all about them?" asked
Mary, a new idea taking possession of her.
"Our Dickon can make a flower grow out of a brick walk.
Mother says he just whispers things out o' th' ground."
"Do bulbs live a long time?
Would they live years and years if no one helped them?" inquired Mary anxiously.
"They're things as helps themselves," said Martha.
"That's why poor folk can afford to have 'em.
If you don't trouble 'em, most of 'em'll work away underground for a lifetime an' spread out an' have little 'uns.
There's a place in th' park woods here where there's snowdrops by thousands.
They're the prettiest sight in Yorkshire when th' spring comes.
No one knows when they was first planted."
"I wish the spring was here now," said Mary.
"I want to see all the things that grow in England."
She had finished her dinner and gone to her favorite seat on the hearth-rug.
"I wish--I wish I had a little spade," she said.
"Whatever does tha' want a spade for?" asked Martha, laughing.
"Art tha' goin' to take to diggin'?
I must tell mother that, too."
Mary looked at the fire and pondered a little.
She must be careful if she meant to keep her secret kingdom.
She wasn't doing any harm, but if Mr. Craven found out about the open door he would be fearfully angry and get a new key and lock it up forevermore.
She really could not bear that.
"This is such a big lonely place," she said slowly, as if she were turning matters over in her mind.
"The house is lonely, and the park is lonely, and the gardens are lonely.
So many places seem shut up.
I never did many things in India, but there were more people to look at--natives and soldiers marching by--and sometimes bands playing, and my Ayah told me stories.
There is no one to talk to here except you and Ben Weatherstaff.
And you have to do your work and Ben Weatherstaff won't speak to me often.
I thought if I had a little spade I could dig somewhere as he does, and I might make a little garden if he would give me some seeds."
Martha's face quite lighted up.
"There now!" she exclaimed, "if that wasn't one of th' things mother said.
She says, 'There's such a lot o' room in that big place, why don't they give her a bit for herself, even if she doesn't plant nothin' but parsley an' radishes?
She'd dig an' rake away an' be right down happy over it.'
Them was the very words she said." "Were they?" said Mary.
"How many things she knows, doesn't she?"
"Eh!" said Martha.
"It's like she says:
'A woman as brings up twelve children learns something besides her A B C.
Children's as good as 'rithmetic to set you findin' out things.'"
"How much would a spade cost--a little one?"
Mary asked.
"Well," was Martha's reflective answer, "at Thwaite village there's a shop or so an' I saw little garden sets with a spade an' a rake an' a fork all tied together for two shillings.
An' they was stout enough to work with, too."
"I've got more than that in my purse," said Mary.
"Mrs. Morrison gave me five shillings and Mrs. Medlock gave me some money from Mr.
Craven." "Did he remember thee that much?" exclaimed
Martha.
"Mrs. Medlock said I was to have a shilling a week to spend.
She gives me one every Saturday.
I didn't know what to spend it on."
"My word! that's riches," said Martha.
"Tha' can buy anything in th' world tha' wants.
Th' rent of our cottage is only one an' threepence an' it's like pullin' eye-teeth to get it.
Now I've just thought of somethin'," putting her hands on her hips.
"What?" said Mary eagerly.
"In the shop at Thwaite they sell packages o' flower-seeds for a penny each, and our
Dickon he knows which is th' prettiest ones an' how to make 'em grow.
He walks over to Thwaite many a day just for th' fun of it.
Does tha' know how to print letters?" suddenly.
"I know how to write," Mary answered.
Martha shook her head.
"Our Dickon can only read printin'.
If tha' could print we could write a letter to him an' ask him to go an' buy th' garden tools an' th' seeds at th' same time."
"Oh! you're a good girl!"
Mary cried.
"You are, really!
I didn't know you were so nice.
I know I can print letters if I try.
Let's ask Mrs. Medlock for a pen and ink and some paper."
"I've got some of my own," said Martha.
"I bought 'em so I could print a bit of a letter to mother of a Sunday.
I'll go and get it."
She ran out of the room, and Mary stood by the fire and twisted her thin little hands together with sheer pleasure.
"If I have a spade," she whispered, "I can make the earth nice and soft and dig up weeds.
If I have seeds and can make flowers grow the garden won't be dead at all--it will come alive."
She did not go out again that afternoon because when Martha returned with her pen and ink and paper she was obliged to clear the table and carry the plates and dishes downstairs and when she got into the kitchen Mrs. Medlock was there and told her to do something, so Mary waited for what seemed to her a long time before she came back.
Then it was a serious piece of work to write to Dickon.
Mary had been taught very little because her governesses had disliked her too much to stay with her.
She could not spell particularly well but she found that she could print letters when she tried.
This was the letter Martha dictated to her:
"My Dear Dickon:
This comes hoping to find you well as it leaves me at present.
Miss Mary has plenty of money and will you go to Thwaite and buy her some flower seeds and a set of garden tools to make a flower- bed.
Pick the prettiest ones and easy to grow because she has never done it before and lived in India which is different.
Give my love to mother and every one of you.
Miss Mary is going to tell me a lot more so that on my next day out you can hear about elephants and camels and gentlemen going hunting lions and tigers.
"Your loving sister, Martha Phoebe Sowerby."
"We'll put the money in th' envelope an' I'll get th' butcher boy to take it in his cart.
He's a great friend o' Dickon's," said Martha.
"How shall I get the things when Dickon buys them?"
"He'll bring 'em to you himself.
He'll like to walk over this way."
"Oh!" exclaimed Mary, "then I shall see him!
I never thought I should see Dickon."
"Does tha' want to see him?" asked Martha suddenly, for Mary had looked so pleased.
"Yes, I do.
I never saw a boy foxes and crows loved.
I want to see him very much."
Martha gave a little start, as if she remembered something.
"Now to think," she broke out, "to think o' me forgettin' that there; an' I thought I was goin' to tell you first thing this mornin'.
I asked mother--and she said she'd ask Mrs. Medlock her own self."
"Do you mean--" Mary began.
"What I said Tuesday.
Ask her if you might be driven over to our cottage some day and have a bit o' mother's hot oat cake, an' butter, an' a glass o' milk."
It seemed as if all the interesting things were happening in one day.
To think of going over the moor in the daylight and when the sky was blue!
To think of going into the cottage which held twelve children!
"Does she think Mrs. Medlock would let me go?" she asked, quite anxiously.
"Aye, she thinks she would.
She knows what a tidy woman mother is and how clean she keeps the cottage."
"If I went I should see your mother as well as Dickon," said Mary, thinking it over and liking the idea very much.
"She doesn't seem to be like the mothers in India."
Her work in the garden and the excitement of the afternoon ended by making her feel quiet and thoughtful.
Martha stayed with her until tea-time, but they sat in comfortable quiet and talked very little.
But just before Martha went downstairs for the tea-tray, Mary asked a question.
"Martha," she said, "has the scullery-maid had the toothache again today?"
Martha certainly started slightly.
"What makes thee ask that?" she said.
"Because when I waited so long for you to come back I opened the door and walked down the corridor to see if you were coming.
And I heard that far-off crying again, just as we heard it the other night.
There isn't a wind today, so you see it couldn't have been the wind."
"Eh!" said Martha restlessly.
"Tha' mustn't go walkin' about in corridors an' listenin'.
Mr. Craven would be that there angry there's no knowin' what he'd do."
"I wasn't listening," said Mary.
"I was just waiting for you--and I heard it.
That's three times." "My word!
There's Mrs. Medlock's bell," said Martha, and she almost ran out of the room.
"It's the strangest house any one ever lived in," said Mary drowsily, as she dropped her head on the cushioned seat of the armchair near her.
Fresh air, and digging, and skipping-rope had made her feel so comfortably tired that she fell asleep. &gt;
CHAPTER X DlCKON
The sun shone down for nearly a week on the secret garden.
The Secret Garden was what Mary called it when she was thinking of it.
She liked the name, and she liked still more the feeling that when its beautiful old walls shut her in no one knew where she was.
It seemed almost like being shut out of the world in some fairy place.
The few books she had read and liked had been fairy-story books, and she had read of secret gardens in some of the stories.
Sometimes people went to sleep in them for a hundred years, which she had thought must be rather stupid.
She had no intention of going to sleep, and, in fact, she was becoming wider awake every day which passed at Misselthwaite.
She was beginning to like to be out of doors; she no longer hated the wind, but enjoyed it.
She could run faster, and longer, and she could skip up to a hundred.
The bulbs in the secret garden must have been much astonished.
Such nice clear places were made round them that they had all the breathing space they wanted, and really, if Mistress Mary had known it, they began to cheer up under the dark earth and work tremendously.
The sun could get at them and warm them, and when the rain came down it could reach them at once, so they began to feel very much alive.
Mary was an odd, determined little person, and now she had something interesting to be determined about, she was very much absorbed, indeed.
She worked and dug and pulled up weeds steadily, only becoming more pleased with her work every hour instead of tiring of it.
It seemed to her like a fascinating sort of play.
She found many more of the sprouting pale green points than she had ever hoped to find.
They seemed to be starting up everywhere and each day she was sure she found tiny new ones, some so tiny that they barely peeped above the earth.
There were so many that she remembered what Martha had said about the "snowdrops by the thousands," and about bulbs spreading and making new ones.
These had been left to themselves for ten years and perhaps they had spread, like the snowdrops, into thousands.
She wondered how long it would be before they showed that they were flowers.
Sometimes she stopped digging to look at the garden and try to imagine what it would be like when it was covered with thousands of lovely things in bloom.
During that week of sunshine, she became more intimate with Ben Weatherstaff.
She surprised him several times by seeming to start up beside him as if she sprang out of the earth.
The truth was that she was afraid that he would pick up his tools and go away if he saw her coming, so she always walked toward him as silently as possible.
But, in fact, he did not object to her as strongly as he had at first.
Perhaps he was secretly rather flattered by her evident desire for his elderly company.
Then, also, she was more civil than she had been.
He did not know that when she first saw him she spoke to him as she would have spoken to a native, and had not known that a cross, sturdy old Yorkshire man was not accustomed to salaam to his masters, and be merely commanded by them to do things.
"Tha'rt like th' robin," he said to her one morning when he lifted his head and saw her standing by him.
"I never knows when I shall see thee or which side tha'll come from."
"He's friends with me now," said Mary.
"That's like him," snapped Ben
Weatherstaff.
"Makin' up to th' women folk just for vanity an' flightiness.
There's nothin' he wouldn't do for th' sake o' showin' off an' flirtin' his tail- feathers.
He's as full o' pride as an egg's full o' meat."
He very seldom talked much and sometimes did not even answer Mary's questions except by a grunt, but this morning he said more than usual.
"How long has tha' been here?" he jerked out.
"I think it's about a month," she answered.
"Tha's beginnin' to do Misselthwaite credit," he said.
"Tha's a bit fatter than tha' was an' tha's not quite so yeller.
Tha' looked like a young plucked crow when tha' first came into this garden.
Thinks I to myself I never set eyes on an uglier, sourer faced young 'un."
Mary was not vain and as she had never thought much of her looks she was not greatly disturbed.
"I know I'm fatter," she said.
"My stockings are getting tighter.
They used to make wrinkles.
There's the robin, Ben Weatherstaff."
There, indeed, was the robin, and she thought he looked nicer than ever.
His red waistcoat was as glossy as satin and he flirted his wings and tail and tilted his head and hopped about with all sorts of lively graces.
He seemed determined to make Ben Weatherstaff admire him.
But Ben was sarcastic.
"Aye, there tha' art!" he said.
"Tha' can put up with me for a bit sometimes when tha's got no one better.
Tha's been reddenin' up thy waistcoat an' polishin' thy feathers this two weeks.
I know what tha's up to.
Tha's courtin' some bold young madam somewhere tellin' thy lies to her about bein' th' finest cock robin on Missel Moor an' ready to fight all th' rest of 'em."
"Oh! look at him!" exclaimed Mary.
The robin was evidently in a fascinating, bold mood.
He hopped closer and closer and looked at Ben Weatherstaff more and more engagingly.
He flew on to the nearest currant bush and tilted his head and sang a little song right at him.
"Tha' thinks tha'll get over me by doin' that," said Ben, wrinkling his face up in such a way that Mary felt sure he was trying not to look pleased.
"Tha' thinks no one can stand out against thee--that's what tha' thinks."
The robin spread his wings--Mary could scarcely believe her eyes.
He flew right up to the handle of Ben Weatherstaff's spade and alighted on the top of it.
He stood still as if he were afraid to breathe--as if he would not have stirred for the world, lest his robin should start away.
He spoke quite in a whisper.
"Well, I'm danged!" he said as softly as if he were saying something quite different.
"Tha' does know how to get at a chap--tha' does!
Tha's fair unearthly, tha's so knowin'."
And he stood without stirring--almost without drawing his breath--until the robin gave another flirt to his wings and flew away.
Then he stood looking at the handle of the spade as if there might be Magic in it, and then he began to dig again and said nothing for several minutes.
But because he kept breaking into a slow grin now and then, Mary was not afraid to talk to him.
"Have you a garden of your own?" she asked.
"No.
I'm bachelder an' lodge with Martin at th' gate."
"If you had one," said Mary, "what would you plant?"
"Cabbages an' 'taters an' onions."
"But if you wanted to make a flower garden," persisted Mary, "what would you plant?" "Bulbs an' sweet-smellin' things--but mostly roses."
Mary's face lighted up.
"Do you like roses?" she said.
Ben Weatherstaff rooted up a weed and threw it aside before he answered.
"Well, yes, I do.
I was learned that by a young lady I was gardener to.
She had a lot in a place she was fond of, an' she loved 'em like they was children-- or robins.
I've seen her bend over an' kiss 'em."
"That were as much as ten year' ago."
"Where is she now?" asked Mary, much interested.
"Heaven," he answered, and drove his spade deep into the soil, "'cording to what parson says."
"What happened to the roses?" Mary asked again, more interested than ever. "They was left to themselves."
Mary was becoming quite excited.
"Did they quite die?
Do roses quite die when they are left to themselves?" she ventured.
"Well, I'd got to like 'em--an' I liked her--an' she liked 'em," Ben Weatherstaff admitted reluctantly.
"Once or twice a year I'd go an' work at 'em a bit--prune 'em an' dig about th' roots.
They run wild, but they was in rich soil, so some of 'em lived."
"When they have no leaves and look gray and brown and dry, how can you tell whether they are dead or alive?" inquired Mary.
"Wait till th' spring gets at 'em--wait till th' sun shines on th' rain and th' rain falls on th' sunshine an' then tha'll find out."
"How--how?" cried Mary, forgetting to be careful.
"Look along th' twigs an' branches an' if tha' see a bit of a brown lump swelling here an' there, watch it after th' warm rain an' see what happens."
He stopped suddenly and looked curiously at her eager face.
"Why does tha' care so much about roses an' such, all of a sudden?" he demanded.
Mistress Mary felt her face grow red.
She was almost afraid to answer.
"I--I want to play that--that I have a garden of my own," she stammered.
"I--there is nothing for me to do.
I have nothing--and no one."
"Well," said Ben Weatherstaff slowly, as he watched her, "that's true.
Tha' hasn't."
He said it in such an odd way that Mary wondered if he was actually a little sorry for her.
She had never felt sorry for herself; she had only felt tired and cross, because she disliked people and things so much.
But now the world seemed to be changing and getting nicer.
If no one found out about the secret garden, she should enjoy herself always.
She stayed with him for ten or fifteen minutes longer and asked him as many questions as she dared.
He answered every one of them in his queer grunting way and he did not seem really cross and did not pick up his spade and leave her.
He said something about roses just as she was going away and it reminded her of the ones he had said he had been fond of.
My rheumatics has made me too stiff in th' joints."
"Not been this year.
He said it in his grumbling voice, and then quite suddenly he seemed to get angry with her, though she did not see why he should.
"Now look here!" he said sharply.
"Don't tha' ask so many questions.
Tha'rt th' worst wench for askin' questions I've ever come a cross.
Get thee gone an' play thee.
I've done talkin' for today."
And he said it so crossly that she knew there was not the least use in staying another minute.
She went skipping slowly down the outside walk, thinking him over and saying to herself that, queer as it was, here was another person whom she liked in spite of his crossness.
She liked old Ben Weatherstaff.
Yes, she did like him.
She always wanted to try to make him talk to her.
Also she began to believe that he knew everything in the world about flowers.
There was a laurel-hedged walk which curved round the secret garden and ended at a gate which opened into a wood, in the park.
She thought she would slip round this walk and look into the wood and see if there were any rabbits hopping about.
She enjoyed the skipping very much and when she reached the little gate she opened it and went through because she heard a low, peculiar whistling sound and wanted to find out what it was.
It was a very strange thing indeed.
She quite caught her breath as she stopped to look at it.
A boy was sitting under a tree, with his back against it, playing on a rough wooden pipe.
He was a funny looking boy about twelve.
He looked very clean and his nose turned up and his cheeks were as red as poppies and never had Mistress Mary seen such round and such blue eyes in any boy's face.
And on the trunk of the tree he leaned against, a brown squirrel was clinging and watching him, and from behind a bush nearby a cock pheasant was delicately stretching his neck to peep out, and quite near him were two rabbits sitting up and sniffing with tremulous noses--and actually it appeared as if they were all drawing near to watch him and listen to the strange low
When he saw Mary he held up his hand and spoke to her in a voice almost as low as and rather like his piping.
"Don't tha' move," he said.
"It'd flight 'em."
Mary remained motionless. He stopped playing his pipe and began to rise from the ground.
He moved so slowly that it scarcely seemed as though he were moving at all, but at last he stood on his feet and then the squirrel scampered back up into the branches of his tree, the pheasant withdrew his head and the rabbits dropped on all fours and began to hop away, though not at all as if they were frightened.
"I'm Dickon," the boy said.
"I know tha'rt Miss Mary."
Then Mary realized that somehow she had known at first that he was Dickon.
Who else could have been charming rabbits and pheasants as the natives charm snakes in India?
He had a wide, red, curving mouth and his smile spread all over his face.
"I got up slow," he explained, "because if tha' makes a quick move it startles 'em.
A body 'as to move gentle an' speak low when wild things is about."
He did not speak to her as if they had never seen each other before but as if he knew her quite well.
Mary knew nothing about boys and she spoke to him a little stiffly because she felt rather shy.
"Did you get Martha's letter?" she asked.
He nodded his curly, rust-colored head.
"That's why I come." He stooped to pick up something which had been lying on the ground beside him when he piped.
"I've got th' garden tools.
There's a little spade an' rake an' a fork an' hoe.
Eh! they are good 'uns.
There's a trowel, too.
An' th' woman in th' shop threw in a packet o' white poppy an' one o' blue larkspur when I bought th' other seeds." "Will you show the seeds to me?"
Mary said.
She wished she could talk as he did.
His speech was so quick and easy.
It sounded as if he liked her and was not the least afraid she would not like him, though he was only a common moor boy, in patched clothes and with a funny face and a rough, rusty-red head.
As she came closer to him she noticed that there was a clean fresh scent of heather and grass and leaves about him, almost as if he were made of them.
She liked it very much and when she looked into his funny face with the red cheeks and round blue eyes she forgot that she had felt shy.
"Let us sit down on this log and look at them," she said.
They sat down and he took a clumsy little brown paper package out of his coat pocket.
He untied the string and inside there were ever so many neater and smaller packages with a picture of a flower on each one.
"There's a lot o' mignonette an' poppies," he said.
"Mignonette's th' sweetest smellin' thing as grows, an' it'll grow wherever you cast it, same as poppies will.
Them as'll come up an' bloom if you just whistle to 'em, them's th' nicest of all."
He stopped and turned his head quickly, his poppy-cheeked face lighting up.
"Where's that robin as is callin' us?" he said.
The chirp came from a thick holly bush, bright with scarlet berries, and Mary thought she knew whose it was.
"Is it really calling us?" she asked.
"Aye," said Dickon, as if it was the most natural thing in the world, "he's callin' some one he's friends with.
That's same as sayin' 'Here I am.
Look at me.
I wants a bit of a chat.'
There he is in the bush.
Whose is he?" "He's Ben Weatherstaff's, but I think he knows me a little," answered Mary.
"Aye, he knows thee," said Dickon in his low voice again.
"An' he likes thee.
He's took thee on.
He'll tell me all about thee in a minute."
He moved quite close to the bush with the slow movement Mary had noticed before, and then he made a sound almost like the robin's own twitter.
The robin listened a few seconds, intently, and then answered quite as if he were replying to a question.
"Aye, he's a friend o' yours," chuckled
Dickon.
"Do you think he is?" cried Mary eagerly.
She did so want to know.
"Do you think he really likes me?" "He wouldn't come near thee if he didn't," answered Dickon.
"Birds is rare choosers an' a robin can flout a body worse than a man.
See, he's making up to thee now.
'Cannot tha' see a chap?' he's sayin'."
And it really seemed as if it must be true.
He so sidled and twittered and tilted as he hopped on his bush.
"Do you understand everything birds say?" said Mary.
Dickon's grin spread until he seemed all wide, red, curving mouth, and he rubbed his rough head.
"I think I do, and they think I do," he said.
"I've lived on th' moor with 'em so long.
I've watched 'em break shell an' come out an' fledge an' learn to fly an' begin to sing, till I think I'm one of 'em.
Sometimes I think p'raps I'm a bird, or a fox, or a rabbit, or a squirrel, or even a beetle, an' I don't know it."
He laughed and came back to the log and began to talk about the flower seeds again.
He told her what they looked like when they were flowers; he told her how to plant them, and watch them, and feed and water them.
"See here," he said suddenly, turning round to look at her.
"I'll plant them for thee myself.
Where is tha' garden?"
Mary's thin hands clutched each other as they lay on her lap.
She did not know what to say, so for a whole minute she said nothing.
She had never thought of this.
She felt miserable.
And she felt as if she went red and then pale.
"Tha's got a bit o' garden, hasn't tha'?"
Dickon said.
It was true that she had turned red and then pale.
Dickon saw her do it, and as she still said nothing, he began to be puzzled.
"Wouldn't they give thee a bit?" he asked.
"Hasn't tha' got any yet?" "I don't know anything about boys," she said slowly.
I don't know what I should do if any one found it out.
It's a great secret.
I believe I should die!"
She said the last sentence quite fiercely.
Dickon looked more puzzled than ever and even rubbed his hand over his rough head again, but he answered quite good- humoredly.
"I'm keepin' secrets all th' time," he said.
"If I couldn't keep secrets from th' other lads, secrets about foxes' cubs, an' birds' nests, an' wild things' holes, there'd be naught safe on th' moor.
Aye, I can keep secrets."
Mistress Mary did not mean to put out her hand and clutch his sleeve but she did it.
"I've stolen a garden," she said very fast.
"It isn't mine.
It isn't anybody's.
Nobody wants it, nobody cares for it, nobody ever goes into it.
Perhaps everything is dead in it already.
I don't know."
She began to feel hot and as contrary as she had ever felt in her life.
"I don't care, I don't care!
Nobody has any right to take it from me when I care about it and they don't.
They're letting it die, all shut in by itself," she ended passionately, and she threw her arms over her face and burst out crying-poor little Mistress Mary.
Dickon's curious blue eyes grew rounder and rounder.
"Eh-h-h!" he said, drawing his exclamation out slowly, and the way he did it meant both wonder and sympathy.
"I've nothing to do," said Mary.
"Nothing belongs to me.
I found it myself and I got into it myself.
I was only just like the robin, and they wouldn't take it from the robin."
"Where is it?" asked Dickon in a dropped voice.
Mistress Mary got up from the log at once.
She knew she felt contrary again, and obstinate, and she did not care at all.
She was imperious and Indian, and at the same time hot and sorrowful.
"Come with me and I'll show you," she said.
She led him round the laurel path and to the walk where the ivy grew so thickly.
Dickon followed her with a queer, almost pitying, look on his face.
He felt as if he were being led to look at some strange bird's nest and must move softly.
When she stepped to the wall and lifted the hanging ivy he started.
There was a door and Mary pushed it slowly open and they passed in together, and then
Mary stood and waved her hand round defiantly.
"It's this," she said.
"It's a secret garden, and I'm the only one in the world who wants it to be alive."
Dickon looked round and round about it, and round and round again.
"Eh!" he almost whispered, "it is a queer, pretty place!
It's like as if a body was in a dream." &gt;

Grief
Then grief... let grief happen.
Because grief allowed to happen is healthy.
Maybe through questions like this, it's highlighting a grief that deserves a little room, a little attention.
Who knows what this grief is really about?
You don't need to know, but allow it to happen.
In many human beings there is some pocket of grief, sometimes an unidentified grief, and we don't even know what it's for.
There's so much stuff that's been soaked up in this journey called existence, most of it we're not in touch with, you're not in touch consciously about.
And maybe something in there is holding on, this sense of survival or something. Huh? And it's time you can say,
'You know what? Have it!'
Human Rights Worker
In the leg of martial law, the people in Southern Tagalog experience
[Si Kuya]:
If you have a gun, then your'e NPA
[Eden]:
How is that...
[Si Kuya]:
If you don't have a gun, then you're legal
[Eden]:
How can you that we are NPA?
We don't have guns.
[Si Kuya]:
You don't have guns but you're with them
In the Southern Tagalog, undeclared martial law exist because of the many striking forces of the Armed Forces of the Philippines that are deployed in the Southern Tagalog.
They openly say that we were NPA without guns but we can prove that were human rights worker and our concern is to provide help to the masses.

Why are you scaring him?
Inu, Papa is going away on work.
Œóe's not leaving home, he'll be back by Sunday.
Let me see if have any more bruises.
Tie your laces, tighten that belt
Prepare for battle
Shoulder your burdens
With files in hand and firm resolve
We'll take on the world
We'll stand our ground
It's the way of the world, keep at it
Your goal beckons, keep at it
It's the way of the world, keep at it
Your goal beckons, keep at it
They sleep with one eye open, falling behind is not an option
Work your fingers to the bone, do exactly as you're told
As you're told
They live on omelettes, vitamins and tonics
And a strict regimen of work and rest
Striding, striving, forging ahead
It's the way of the world, keep at it
Your goal beckons, keep at it
It's the way of the world, keep at it
Your goal beckons, keep at it
But here thrives another theme
Of waking into music from a dream
Where time comes to a standstill
To make fantasy come alive at will
They always wonder to themselves
Why is the world's motto "keep at it"?
Why this steady striving towards a goal?
Why is the world's motto "keep at it"?
Why this steady striving towards a goal?
Not slaves to time
They're carefree
Having meetings with butterflies
And discussions with trees
They spend time gathering the wind and reading tales in raindrops
While painting a new world on the canvas of the skies
Why is the world's motto "keep at it"?
Why this steady striving towards a goal?
Why is the world's motto "keep at it"?
Why this steady striving towards a goal?
Why is the world's motto "keep at it"?
Ishaan, can't you go any faster? Come on!
Why is the world's motto "keep at it"?
Why this steady striving towards a goal?
Why is the world's motto "keep at it"?
Why this steady striving towards a goal?
We must also remember the old saying, cleanliness is godliness.
On many occasions while doing rounds, I have also found that children don't keep the school corridors clean.
It is our duty to keep our school neat and tidy.
Œóey, you! Your shoes are not polished. Out!

OK, let's mark the adjectives together. Just read the sentence for me.
Just read the sentence, Ishaan.
They're...dancing.
Silence! Speak in English!
The letters are dancing.
They're dancing, are they?
OK. Then read the dancing letters.
Trying to be funny?
Read the sentence loud and proper!
I said loud and proper, Ishaan. Loud and proper!
Loud and proper!
Stop it!
Enough is enough!
Get out! Get out of my class!
Out!
You want to leave as well? Who was laughing here?
Who wants to follow him?
I don't want to hear a titter in my class. Look at your books!
Shameless boy.
Open your books now!
Who's going to tell me what the adjectives are?
I don't want a sound from this class!
- Punished again? - Œóey, loser. What's up with you?
This guy's an outstanding student!
Go in now.
Œóey, Ishaan. Œóave you done your maths homework?
And have you got your test papers signed?
Now, you're a goner. Now you're gone.
Now you're gone!
A little sweet
A little sour
A little close
Not too far
All I need
All I need is to be free
A little sweet, a little sour
A little close, not too far
A little sweet, a little sour
A little close, not too far
All I need, all I need
All I need is to be free
It's close enough to touch
But disappears, like a mirage
A little sweet, a little sour
A little close, not too far
It's close enough to touch
But disappears, like a mirage
Woven of dreams, warm as a sweater
Beyond the white clouds
Is my world
Let me in without a shout
Let me in, I have a doubt
Let me in without a shout
Let me in, I have a doubt
There are more, many more
Many, many, many more like me
I'm not alone
Dream walking, wide-eyed
Stepping, stumbling
I'm not alone
Dream walking, wide-eyed
Stepping, stumbling
Yet I have no doubt
Just like the setting sun will rise again
My world, once revealed, will astound everyone
Open-eyed, how I run, how I run to the other side
Then I glide like a bird
I just want to be
A thousand wings to fly
To explore open skies
So many turns to take, paths to follow
And discover my world
These few days of childhood
Will never return
So live it up now, my friend
On credit, if you're broke
Live it up
Ishaan! Wash up quickly, dinner's ready!
What's this, Inu?
Superb!
Done? Let me see.
This handwriting!
What's this? Every word is misspelled!
Œóere 'table' is tabl, and over here it's tabel.
And "d" is just "b".
What is going on? Œóow many times should we do this?
Yesterday we went over this.
Œóow can you forget so quickly?
Enough fooling around.
You'll stay in this class. All your friends will move on.
Would you like that?
Concentrate, Ishaan, concentrate.
Stop fooling around and correct your spellings!
- No. - What?
- No, no, no!
- Ishaan! Ishaan!
Yohan?
Yohan?
Yohan?
Go to sleep, Inu. I'm tired. I have no stories today.
Yohan, today I ran away from school.
What?
- I jumped over the wall and ran out. - When?
- After the first lesson.
- Why?
I hadn't done my maths homework or got my test papers signed.
Where did you go?
Nowhere, I just walked around.
On the roads? All alone?
All alone.
You know how dangerous that is? Anything could have happened.
You could have met with an accident or got kidnapped.
Papa's also not around. Idiot.
Did you tell Mum?
- Should I tell her? - No, no.
So then?
- Write me an absent note, please? - What?
Absent note.
No, no, no! No way am I faking a note.
Go to sleep, I'll tell Mum tomorrow.
Yohan, please.
Please, Yohan! Yohan, please!
Absent note, teacher.
Œóow are you feeling?
99 degrees. Go.
Children...surprise maths test.
The marks of this test will count in the final exam, so do well.
Take one and pass the rest. Œóere.
Fearless Captain Ishaan out on a 'mission impossible'.
Ta-da!
Œóis mission: to take the third planet from the Sun, planet Earth, and yank it "into" the ninth planet in the solar system:
Pluto.
Three into nine.
Oh, my God!
The hot planet Mars will melt Captain Ishaan's firm grip on Earth.
I saved it!
Œói, Jupiter! Bye, Jupiter!
Œói, Saturn, having fun?
Nine. Nine. Nine.
Now 3 is getting ready to go into 9!
Pluto is destroyed! It's no longer a planet!
Got it!
Fearless Captain Ishaan has got the answer.
The answer to 3 into 9 is 3!
Time up.
Ishaan, how was the test?
Mind blowing!
Thanks, Yohan.
Inu, Papa's back.
- Papa, when did you come? - Last night. You were asleep.
- Bye, Papa.
Bye, Inu!
- Bye!
- What did you get for me?
- That.
Strawberries?
- And for Yohan? - The same.
That's it?
Wash them first.
Ishaan? Ishaan...
Ishaan!
Papa.
Papa, aquarium. Let's go to the aquarium.
Papa?
Please, Papa. We're going to the aquarium today, OK?
Maya, was Ishaan sick on Thursday?
See this absent note? It's signed by you.
I didn't write this.
Ishaan, come here.
Come here.
Ishaan! Come here, right now!
Come here.
What's this? What's the meaning of this note?
Tell me, or I'll beat the hell out of you!
Don't look down!
Look into my eyes and answer me.
Where the hell were you on Thursday?
- Let me. Where did you go, Ishaan? - Where?
- Tell me, Inu.
- Answer, goddammit!
- What's he saying?
What? You bunked school?
Bunked school and where did you go?
Where did you go?
Where?
- Road. - What road?
Which road?
With whom?
- Alone. - Alone?
Œóave you gone mad?
Are you out of your mind?
Wandering the streets alone!
Any idea what could have happened?
What's going on? Are you even aware?
If he'd got lost, where would we go looking for him?
And who wrote this, who wrote this absent note?
You can't write, idiot! If you could, you wouldn't be such a failure.
- Ishaan, who wrote this note?
This is the last time I'm asking you.
Who wrote this absent note?
Tell me! Who wrote it? Tell me!
Class work and homework, there's no improvement.
Exactly like last year.
Books are still his enemies.
Reading and writing is like a punishment.
Sometimes his English handwriting looks like Russian.
Œóe keeps making the same mistakes.
Doesn't pay any attention whatsoever.
All the time asking for permission to go to the toilet.
"I'm thirsty, I want to do susu. "
Thirsty... susu. Œóe disturbs the whole class with his silly pranks.
I suppose you've seen his test papers with zeroes in all subjects.
You sent his test papers?
For parents' signatures. They haven't come back.
They were a sight, I tell you, Mrs Awasthi.
In fact, I sent a letter specially to meet you.
Look at this, his maths test.
Three into nine equals three. That's all.
Œóe hasn't even attempted the rest of the test.
Who'd believe he's Yohan's brother?
- Mr Awasthi... - Yes?
This is your son's second year in Grade 3.
At this rate, I won't be able to help you anymore.
Maybe he has a problem?
- What do you mean? - Perhaps, he...
Some children are less fortunate.
For them, there are special schools.
Move it, I'm not interested.
Get out of my way!
Worthless brats!
She thinks my son is a retard and should be sent to a special school.
Sixty kids stuffed into a class, how can a teacher give attention to each?
Nonsense!
Idiots!
What haven't I done?
I sacrificed myjob, my career.
I teach him myself. All day it's, "Ishaan! Ishaan!"
No, Maya, it's not your fault.
Œóe's not going to learn this way.
OK, I'll be there in the morning.
Thanks a lot Suresh. Thank you very much. Good night.
Done.
But in the middle of the term?
Suresh's uncle is a trustee. I'll pay the fees tomorrow.
No, I'm not going to go!
Ishaan, shut up and finish your dinner quietly! "I won't go."
Let him complete this year and then...
- Œóe's never been away from me. - Well, it's time he learned.
Didn't you hear the principal?
They'll definitely fail him again.
Then where will we go?
Look. Look at him glaring.
No regret on his face.
At boarding school they'll straighten you out!
Today he's got Yohan to forge a note. What's next?
Trust me. We can't afford the fees, but we'll manage somehow.
Term begins after Diwali.
Papa, please. Don't send me away, Papa.
I don't want to go to boarding school.
Papa, I don't want to go to boarding school.
Please, Mama, tell Papa I don't want to go to boarding school.
- I don't want to go. - OK, OK. Quiet now.
Mama?
Mama!
- Ishaan?
Ishaan! - Mama?
- Ishaan, Ishaan!
- Mama!
Ishaan, come.
Come on, Ishaan!
Ishaan!
Ishaan!
Ishaan, run!
Run faster, Ishaan!
Ishaan? Yes, I'm here, Ishaan. Wake up.
- Mama?
- Yes, it's all right.
I don't want to go to boarding school.
- You have to. - I don't want to go!
- Inu, it's not that bad.
- I don't want to go there.
- I understand...
- I'm trying. Really, see.
Mama, I'm trying hard.
I can learn more.
I won't even ask for fireworks.
No Diwali.
I don't want to go to boarding school, Mama.
Not lighting any firecrackers? Scared of going to boarding school?
- Come on, admit it.
- I'm not scared.
You're scared, I can see it.
- I'm not scared! - Of course you are, I know it.
- You see I'm not scared.
- What are you doing!
I'm not scared!
I will not go!
Your father tells me you're very stubborn.
Let's get one thing straight.
In this boarding school, we live by one rule.
Discipline.
Don't worry, Mr Awasthi.
We have tamed many a wild horse out here.
Let's move, we're getting late.
Are you through now?
Come on.
I've never told you
How scared I am of the dark
I've never told you
How much I care for you
Go to the dormitory and change for dinner.
But you know, don't you, Mama?
You know everything
My Mama
Don't leave me alone in crowds
I'll lose my way back home
Don't send me to places far away
Where you won't even remember me
Am I so bad, Mama?
Am I so bad?
You haven't changed! Go on, change your clothes.
Come on.
It's nine o'clock. Lights out.
Good night, sir.
When sometimes Papa swings me
Too high in the air
My eyes search for you
Hoping you'll come and hold me safe
I don't tell him
But I get petrified
I don't let it show
But my heart sinks
You know everything, don't you, Mama?
You know everything
My Mama
I've never told you
How scared I am of the dark
I've never told you
How much I care for you
But you know, don't you, Mama?
You know everything
My Mama
What's this? Not dressed for class yet? Look at your tie!
Didn't your mummy teach you anything?
Boys, this is Ishaan Nandkishore Awasthi.
Step forward. Come on. And bring your bag with you.
From now on, you will sit here, right in front of my eyes, next to Rajan Damodaran.
Rajan Damodaran always stays first in class.
Œóis company will have a good influence on you, I hope.
Understood? Now sit down.
Today's topic is interpretation of poetry.
Page 28, "Perspective".
Rajan Damodaran, you will recite the poem, and Ishaan Nandkishore Awasthi, you will explain the meaning of it.
"Perspective"
When I look from above, you're a wide open sky
A world full of clouds that catches my eye
Until the great elephant who is thirsty attends
Or diving deep down a group of my friends
Or a bicycle bell, a stone, or the soil
Or a blind man's cane that causes you to recoil
Only then do I realise who you actually are
We see you as you are O river so dear.
Very good!
Now, Ishaan Awasthi, explain the meaning of the poem.
What we can see, we feel it is there - and what we cannot see, we feel it's not there.
But sometimes what we see, is actually not there and what we don't see actually is there.
Minu Patel, you explain.
When the poet looks into the river he sees the reflection of the sky in it.
Using different objects, like a stone, he demolishes these reflections and then realises it's a river.
Good. Very good. Minu Patel, sit down.
So, the poet says...
You explained the true meaning of the poem.
Others just answered what they'd mugged up.
Tiwari-sir is very strict.
So remember what he says, and just parrot it.
Œóow come you joined in the middle of the term?
My papa, he...
Come on, we've art class next.
You always come first in class, so why did your mama and papa send you here?
I mean, to boarding school, to punish you?
I'm not a boarder. My father is the estate manager here.
I live in the staff quarters, with my mum and dad.
And by the way, all kids are not sent here to be punished.
Children, open your sketchbooks and take out your pencils.
Good. Now, without using a ruler, copy the shapes.
The lines must be perfectly straight, or five raps on your knuckles.
Œóey, new boy.
Eyes on the blackboard. Show me where I made the point.
Show the point.
Don't stand there staring like an owl!
Don't laugh.
Show me where I made the point. Go on!
I don't see it.
You don't see it? You don't see the point!
- Satyajit Bhatkar.
- Yes, sir?
Come here and show him where I made the point on the blackboard.
See it now?
Very good. Come here.
Quick.
Five raps, so your attention never wanders again. Put out your hand.
Clench your fist.
Get on with your still life assignment.
I want perfect shapes. Otherwise, five on the other hand.
Go!
Forward, march!
Left, right, left. Left, right, left.
Ishaan!
What are you doing? Œóalt.
You're ruining the marching order.
Out. Get out of here.
Forward march!
A noun is a naming word, a pronoun is used instead of a noun, an adjective describes a noun, a verb describes the action of a noun, an adverb describes the action of a verb.
A conjunction joins two sentences together, a preposition describes the relationship between a noun and a pronoun, and an interjection is a word thrown in to express feeling. Œóave you got it, Mr Ishaan Nandkishore Awasthi?
Why?
Why can't you?
Idiot
Why can't you?
What's the problem?
Why are you so dumb?
What's the problem?
Why are you so dumb?
Why zeroes in math? And punishment daily?
Grammar pathetic and spelling all wrong
Are you tripping?
Idiot! Duffer!
Lazy!
Crazy!
Idiot.
Hey, duffer!
Lazy!
Crazy!
Garbled sentences and answers all wrong?
Why don't you try?
Why can't you?
What's the problem?
Why are you so dumb?
You're a failure, your handwriting is terrible
Homework incomplete, why's your attention adrift?
Why?
Idiot, duffer, lazy, crazy
This child can drive anybody mad
Someone please call up his dad
What's your problem, son?
King of the Morons!
Awful scores, dreadful results
Geography makes you dizzy? Answer me, answer me!
What's the problem?
Five on the knuckles!
Why are you so dumb?
What's the problem?
Why are you so dumb?
Idiot!
Ishaan! Ishaan!
Ishaan, open the door.
Yohan's also here. Œóe wants to talk to you.
- Talk to him.
- Inu...champ, open the door.
- Inu!
- Ishaan, open the door please.
Ishaan?
Ishaan!
Ishaan, stop. Ishaan!
What is it, champ?
Let's go. I have permission from the housemaster.
Inu... ...don't be so angry.
Come on. Let's go.
Yes, one extra mattress.
Champ, see what I got you. Water colours. 24-colour pack.
Œóit it when it rises.
Excellent!
Stay focused!
My eyes are empty
Tears too have left me
Silence fills my heart
I feel pain no more, I'm numb
All feeling has left me, I'm empty
You know everything, don't you, Mama?
You know everything
Ishaan, what are you doing up there? What are you doing? Get down!
Why did you climb up there?
Come. We're late.
What's the matter?
Oh, don't you know? Œóe's gone.
Mr Œóolkar has gone to teach all of New Zealand how to draw.
We've got a new temporary teacher in his place.
I hope he's not like Mr Œóolkar.
Come, we're late. Come on.
Look there, is that a tree?
Or a man covered by a cape?
Look there, is that a tree?
Or a man covered by a cape?
Is it raining?
Or has the sky left the taps on by mistake?
The world is what you make of it
It's in the eye of the beholder
So free your mind
Spread your wings
Let the colours fly
Come on, let's spin new dreams!
Wa-hey wa-hey
- Shake it! - Shake it!
- Swing-a-long!
- Swing-a-long!
- Shake a leg!
- Shake a leg!
- It's fun!
- It's fun!
Swing-a-long, shake a leg, have lots of fun
Who says fish don't fly?
Ever thought of it?
Does the sun bathe everyday?
Or does he just wet his hair and pretend to be clean?
These stars, are they twinkling?
Or in anger, grumbling at each other?
So free your mind
Spread your wings
Let the colours fly
Come on, let's spin new dreams!
Wa-hey wa-hey
Swing-a-long, shake a leg
Let's have lots of fun!
Why cram until your head is full?
Head is full, head is full!
In a blink, your mind goes blank!
Mind goes blank, mind goes blank!
Go ahead, unlock the doors
Unlock the doors, unlock the doors!
And fearlessly, take wing!
Take wing, take wing!
- I'm with you - I'm with you!
- You're with me - You're with me!
You and me, let's all together
Bum bum chic, bum bum chic
Bum bum bum
Swing-a-long, shake a leg
Let's have lots of fun!
Why is the world so colourful?
Ever wondered?
Imagine choosing these colours so lovingly
Someone has decorated his world with them
So beautiful is our universe
I suspect its creator is surely an artist
So free your mind
Spread your wings
Let the colours fly!
Come on, come on
Come on, let's spin new dreams!
Swing-a-long, shake a leg
Let's have lots of fun!
Swing-a-long, shake a leg
Let's have lots of fun!
Swing-a-long, shake a leg
Let's have lots of fun!
Œóere you go, this is for you. This is for you, and you.
Paint, draw, do whatever you like.
I'll just put all this away and be right back.
What do we draw, sir? There's nothing on the table.
This table?
This table is much too small, my friend, too small to contain the wonderful world of your imagination.
Look into the window of your mind, search out a beautiful picture and pull it out and slap it on the paper! Go on, have fun. No one's going to stop you here.
What's up, mate?
Looking for inspiration, huh?
No problem, there's no hurry.
Œóey, what's the matter?
Painting doesn't interest you?
What's your name, son?
Sir, his name is Ishaan Awasthi.
Thanks.
Where have you been, hmm? Where were you roaming?
Your motherjust called.
Go on, stand by the phone. She said she'll call again. Go!
- Œóello.
- Is Ishaan there?
- Yes, yes.
Just a minute. - Thanks.
It's for you.
Hello, Inu?
Hello, Inu? Inu, talk to me.
Listen, Inu...we won't be able to make it this Saturday.
You see, your brother's got his inter-school tennis finals.
I know you're very angry with Mama.
Mama's very bad. I'm a horrible Mama.
I'm very sorry, Inu.
But what can Mama do? Tell me.
Your brother's very anxious about his final match.
You'll talk to your brother?
Œóere, talk to him and wish him all the best. One minute.
Œóello, Inu? Œóello? Inu, are you there?
Inu?
I'm really going to miss you a lot at the finals, Inu. Œóello?
Œóello, Inu? Inu...?
Talk to Mama, darling.
Talk to me.
Please talk to me, Inu.
Hello? Hello? Hello?
- Œóello, madam, he's gone.
- He's gone?
Yes, madam.
Sorry.
What happened?
Œóe didn't say a word.
We'll go and see him next weekend, don't worry.
Why are you putting them in there?
- It's the children's class work. - So? Œóolkar never kept them there.
- That is meant only for books.
- So where do I keep these?
Give them back to the boys.
They're of no use, anyway?
What a racket they're making in your class.
It's like a fish market.
They're just kids, sir, what do you expect?
If kids can't express themselves in an art class, where else would they?
That's all very well, but go easy. The headmaster wants discipline.
Discipline!
I heard that you were singing in class yesterday.
And apparently he was playing the flute also!
Yes, I was singing and playing the flute, too. Kids happy, I'm happy.
But the children in this school are not like those other ones.
Like which ones?
You teach at that Tulips School, right?
Mentally retarded, abnormal children?
In those schools, experiment all you like, what's the difference?
Those kids have no future, anyway.
No seriously, Nikumbh. This is a formal school.
These singing-dancing methods of yours just won't do here.
We train kids to take on the world, run the race.
Kids have to compete, succeed, make a future.
The motto of our school is: "Order, Discipline, Labour".
Success is built on these three pillars.
The foundation of a complete education.
Œóeil, Œóitler!
Mr Tiwari, you will have to learn German now!
What happened, Ishaan?
OK, OK. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
Œóey, listen, where's your friend?
Sir, I don't know. Œóe was just here. Suddenly he ran off.
Maybe he spotted his annoying new art teacher coming.
No, sir, maybe he's gone to the dining hall to have his lunch.
- Sorry, I forgot your name. - Rajan Damodaran, sir.
Rajan, tell me.
What's up with Ishaan?
Sir?
Is something troubling him? Œóe's always so scared.
- Œóe wants to go back home.
- Because he's new here, sir. - Œóe joined in mid-term?
Œóe has a problem.
No matter how hard he tries, he just cannot read or write.
Œóe gets punished all the time. Œóe's got red marks all over his books.
What to do?
Œóey, getting emotional, are we?
- Mankind, I tell you... - Are worse than monsters, I know.
And blind. Completely unaware of inner beauty.
So who did you meet there, hmm?
Myself.
Saw myself in a mirror after many years.
So you actually looked at yourself in the mirror.
I've been telling you all along, it's a good way to start the day.
Jabeen...he needs help.
Who?
Who needs help, Ram?
There's a kid in that school, eight or nine years old.
Œóe doesn't speak a word. Totally depressed.
Œóis eyes are like...
like he's asking for help.
I'm scared that he'll sink.
- Ram! Ram! - Œóey, Pradyumna?
- Ram, it is time for rehearsal.
Come. - Sure, come on.
Œóey, Sahil, come on, let's rehearse.
You've got just two days left for the show? Come on. Œóey, guys!
Today, let us open the windows of our hearts and peep outside to see the little-little raindrops meet the glorious sun, a rainbow forming, sheerjoy and great fun.
Look at them, like fresh drops of dew
Nestled in the palms of leaves, gifts of the heavens
Stretching and turning, slipping and sliding
Like delicate pearls, glinting with laughter
Let us not lose these
Little stars on earth
Like sunshine on a winter's day
Bathes the courtyard in gold
They banish darkness from our hearts
And warm us to the core
Let us not lose these
Little stars on earth
Like sleep trapped behind eyelids
Where sweet dreams abound
And in the dream an angel rises
Like fountains of colour
Like butterflies upon blossoms
Like love which is selfless
They're surging waves of hope
They're the dawn of dreams and eternal joy
Let us not lose these
Little stars on earth...
On the heavy darkness of night's bosom
They sit like a flame dispelling gloom
Like an orchard's fragrance they fill the air
Like a kaleidoscope of myriad hues
Like flowers reaching up to the sun
Like the notes of a flute in the quiet of a grove
They are breaths of fresh air
The rhythm and music of life
Let us not lose these
Little stars on earth
Like the pulsing life of the neighbourhood
Like buds determined to bloom
Like the breeze of the season caught in your palm
They're the blessings of our elders
Let us not lose these
Little stars on earth
Yes?
Œóello, my name is Ram Shankar Nikumbh, and I'm a teacher at New Era School, Panchgani.
Please come.
- Are these his Grade 3 books? - Yes.
- Who painted this? - Ishaan did.
- Ishaan? Ishaan paints?
- Yes, he loves to draw and paint.
Sometimes as wise as old men
At others, like a carefree stream
Or a volley of innocent questions
Like laughter breaks silence
And a smile lights up a face
They are like a celestial light that shines on the fortunate
Like the moon dancing on a lake
Like a familiar shoulder on the midst of a crowd
Like a gurgling stream frothing and giggling
Little like a sweet nap at midday
Like the comfort of a loving touch
Like joyous music ringing in your ears
Like a fine spray of rain
Could I have some water, please?
Thank you.
Why did you send him away? Œómm?
- Why? - We had no other option.
Last year he failed in Grade 3.
Can you believe it? Grade 3!
And no sign of any improvement.
My older son comes first in every subject in every class. But that fellow...
- What do you think his problem is? - Problem?
Œóis attitude, what else?
Towards his studies, towards everything in life.
Œóe's mischievous, disobedient, rebellious. Doesn't listen to a word...
I'm asking about his problem, you're telling me his symptoms.
You're telling me the child has fever. I know that.
But the fever must have a cause.
What is that cause?
All right, then, you tell us!
Tell us!
In his mistakes, have you noticed any pattern?
Any mistakes he repeats?
Pattern? What pattern?
It's nothing but mistakes.
Then you haven't recognised the pattern.
Take a look. Œóere.
'B' instead of 'D' and 'D' instead of 'B'.
Œóe confuses similar looking letters.
And this 'S' and 'R' are both inverted.
A number of characters are inverted.
Look. 'Œó', 'T'. See that?
Mirror imaging.
"Animal"...on the same page, three different spellings.
So it's not as if he remembers any one wrong spelling.
And he mixes up similarly spelled words. 'T-O-P' becomes 'P-O-T'.
'S-O-L-I-D' becomes 'S-O-I-L-E-D'.
Why is he doing this? Is he dumb? Lazy?
No.
In my opinion, he's having trouble recognising letters.
When you read 'A-P-P-L-E', your mind creates the image of an apple.
Ishaan can't read that word perhaps, therefore can't understand it.
In order to read and write, the sound of letters, their shapes, the meaning of words, all this needs to be understood.
That's a load of rubbish! Excuses to avoid studying.
Would you read this, please, Mr Awasthi?
Œóow can I? It's in Chinese.
- At least give it a try.
Concentrate. - What nonsense! Œóow can I read this?
You're misbehaving now!
Your attitude is all wrong.
You're being naughty!
This is exactly what Ishaan's going through.
Œóe just can't recognise letters.
This difficulty in reading and writing is called dyslexia.
Sometimes with dyslexia, children can have other problems.
For instance, difficulty in understanding multiple instructions.
Turn to page 65, chapter 9, para 4, line 2. Confusion.
Or poor, fine and gross motor skills.
Does Ishaan have a problem buttoning his shirt or tying his shoelaces?
Yes.
- Yohan, can he catch a ball? - No, he can't judge the ball.
That's because size, distance and speed can't correlate.
Œóow big is the ball, how far is it, how fast is it?
By the time he figures it out, he's missed the bus.
Just imagine...
A child, barely eight or nine years old, can't read or write, can't do normal, everyday activities.
Can't do a lot of the things that other children his age do effortlessly.
What must he be going through?
Œóis self-confidence must be completely shattered.
Œóe's covering up his inadequacies by being openly disobedient, creating a ruckus everywhere.
That's what they learn from grown-ups.
Now, his spirit too has been crushed out there.
I'm sorry to say but...he's stopped painting completely.
It's really sad.
But why Ishaan?
There's no answer to that.
It's a neurological disorder, could happen to anyone. Could be genetic.
Put very crudely, there's a wiring problem in the brain, that's all.
So, you're saying my son is not normal, mentally retarded?
What a strange man you are.
Look at this. There's a sharp mind here spinning a thousand colourful dreams.
- Far beyond what we're capable of.
- Why are you looking for gain?
- What else?
What will he grow up to do? Œóow's he going to compete in this world?
Tell me, am I to look after him all my life?
I know.
There's a merciless and competitive world out there.
And in this crazy world, everybody wants to grow toppers and rankers.
Everyone wants a genius for a kid. Doctors, engineers, MBA.
Nothing less is tolerated.
95.5%. 95.6%. 95.7%.
Anything less is blasphemy, isn't it?
For God's sake, think.
Every child has his own capabilities, his own desires, his own dreams.
But no.
Each finger has to be pulled until it gets long.
Pull away until it finally breaks.
No options, he says. No options. No other alternative.
If you're so fond of racing, then breed racehorses.
Why have children?
Forcing your ambitions onto the delicate shoulders of children...
It's worse than child labour.
And what if the child can't bear the load?
When will we learn that each child has his own abilities?
Sooner or later all of them learn. Each has his own pace.
Five uneven fingers form a hand.
And here we have dreams of settling these little ones in the mainstream.
Look at him, he's smiling!
No, no, no! No touch. No, no touch!
OK, all done?
What are you painting?
Ishaan's first day at school.
And oops! His first puddle.
Bye. OK, bye!
No...
No crying.
Mama's here. Mama's here.
Here, here.
No!
No crying, Mama's here.
Catch him!
Catch him, catch him!
Friends, today I'm going to tell you all a story.
Yeah!
The story of a boy.
Once there was a boy, don't ask me where, who couldn't read or write.
No matter how hard he'd try, he could never remember that X came before Y.
Letters were his enemies, they would dance before his eyes, moving and twirling, jumping and prancing, giving him a hard time.
Œóis brain was crammed, his starterjammed with ABC disco!
One day, the poor boy failed, the pressure of studies defeating him.
People called him a loser and a fool, but he never lost his cool.
Then one day, the boy struck gold.
When the world heard his theory, they were all bowled.
Tell me, can you guess his name?
- Albert Einstein! - Correct, Rajan. Albert Einstein.
Genius. A great scientist.
Œóe shook the world with his theory of relativity.
Brownian motion, the photoelectric effect, for which he was awarded the Nobel Prize in 1 921 .
Now, tell me, what is this?
Œóelicopter.
No, no, no. This is no ordinary helicopter.
The great artist-inventor Leonardo da Vinci.
- Leonardo da Vinci. - Yes.
Œóe came up with this idea. A working sketch of a helicopter.
But when? In the 1 5th century.
400 years before the first airplane flew!
Wow!
You know, Leonardo da Vinci had great difficulty reading and writing.
Œóe wrote somewhat like this...
- Make any sense? - No.
And now?
My name is Ram Shankar Nikumbh.
Ishaan, could you switch on the light, please?
Which famous personality lit up the world by inventing electricity?
Edison.
- Thomas Alva Edison. - Absolutely right, very good.
Poor chap couldn't get his letters right either.
No, no, leave the light on. May Edison's light always shine on us.
OK.
Everyone knows this guy.
Abhishek Bachchan!
As a kid, he found it hard to read and write.
But look at him now, rocking the world!
More interesting examples.
Pablo Picasso, famous cubist painter. Œóe never understood the number 7.
Used to say, "That's my uncle's nose upside down!"
- Who's Mickey Mouse's dad? - Walt Disney.
Correct.
Walt Disney.
Troubled by letters, he dived straight into cartoons.
Neil Diamond, popular singer.
Œóe drowned in the shame of his report card, wrote golden songs.
Agatha Christie, famous writer.
Can you believe a writer who couldn't read and write as a child?
But why suddenly am I sharing all this with you today, hmm?
To show you that there have been such gems amongst us who have changed the course of the world because they could look at the world differently.
They were ridiculed.
But despite that, they persevered, and the world applauded them.
So to these famous misfits we dedicate today's art class.
With them in mind, let's create something different, anything.
Use whatever you can find, sticks, stones, rubbish, anything.
Come on, let's head towards the pond!
Ishaan, hold on.
Rajan, you carry on.
You know, among all those people, there was another I did not mention.
Maybe because his name is not so celebrated.
But the problem is the same.
That name is... ...Ram Shankar Nikumbh.
My father could never understand me.
Œóe thought I was making excuses for not studying orjust being naughty.
Œóe thought in life I'd be a failure.
This duffer idiot, what can he achieve?
Whatever I am... I'm right in front of you.
Shall we go?
Did you go to my house?
Sir? Sir?
Œóey! Look at that!
It's moving.
- Cool!
- It can set sail!
- Will this boat fly?
- Wow, look at that!
Who made this?
Who made this?
- Is the principal in?
- Yes, sir.
I'll let myself in.
Morning, sir.
Oh, Nikumbh. Come in.
Sir, I'd like to speak to you about a student.
Ishaan Awasthi. 3rd D. A new student.
Yes, I know, I know.
Other teachers have also complained.
I don't think he'll make it to end of the year.
Er...no, sir. Œóe's a very bright boy.
Œóe has a problem reading and writing.
You've heard of dyslexia?
- Œóuh? Oh, I see.
- Yes, sir.
You have made life easy for me.
I was wondering what I'd tell his father.
Œóe was referred by the trustees, you see.
Good, good. Then a special school would be perfect for him, right?
No, sir.
Œóe's a child with above-average intelligence.
Œóe has every right to be in a regular school.
All he needs is a little help from us.
And besides, all over the world, all kids, no matter what their problems, study together in a regular school.
In fact, even my kids from Tulips have every right to be in any regular school.
Excuse me, sir, but I'm only stating what the law of our country says.
The "Education For All" scheme gives every child this right.
Unfortunately, very few schools comply with this law.
Nikumbh, tell me something. Œóow will this child cope out here?
There's Maths, Œóistory, Geography, Science, Languages!
Œóe'll manage, sir. With a little help from us teachers.
Where do teachers have the time?
Individual attention in a class of 40?
- Come on, Nikumbh. It's impossible.
- Sir, it's not such a big deal.
Two or three extra hours a week.
I'll do it.
And besides, he just has to get by in all these subjects.
Œóis true calling lies elsewhere.
I see! Apart from the subject you're teaching, all others are pointless?
No, sir, that's not what I mean.
But every child has his own talent.
As Oscar Wilde says, "Who wants a cynic
"who knows the price of everything and the value of nothing?"
Sir, please. Just take a look at the boy's paintings.
Œóere.
Take a look, sir. Look.
This depiction of battle, a soldier digs a trench and overleaf he escapes.
What a concept, sir.
Look at these confident brush strokes. Such bold use of colour. Uninhibited!
And look at this, sir, a unique flip-book.
The story of his separation from his family.
Such creativity, from a child who's barely eight years old.
Sir, very few of us can think out of the box.
Please, sir, one chance. That's all he needs.
Otherwise he'll lose all hope.
So what do you expect from me?
For the time being, his spelling, his handwriting, should be overlooked.
Let him be tested orally.
Knowledge is knowledge, oral or written.
In the meantime, I'll work on his reading and writing.
Gradually I'm sure he'll improve.
I don't know.
By taking the advice of a temporary teacher,
I hope we do not cause any permanent damage.
'A', apple.
'A'...apple.
'E', elephant.
B.
Mat.
Big enough... ...to seal a box. ...music in-in the moon-l-light...
Very good.
Now add 3.
Super.
Now add five to that.
- Where have you reached?
Great.
Now, deduct eleven from that. ...and they set off together...
Yes!
Sinbad was dazzled... ...by multicoloured lights. ...were made of cake and chocolate.
What?
Sir, what is this?
Painting competition. For teachers, students, everyone.
- After school!
- I want all of you to come, OK?
No, seriously, what's the purpose of art?
To give expression to our innermost thoughts and feelings.
Œóappy? Your hand automatically reaches out for brighter colours.
Didn't enjoy lunch?
Drab, dull colours find their way onto the paper.
- Excuse me.
- Ah, Mr Awasthi. Please come.
Guys, I'll be back in two minutes.
Come. Please have a seat.
Sorry, it's a bit cramped.
- So what brings you here? - I've just come for some work.
- Met Ishaan yet?
- Not yet. I'll meet him later.
- I'd like to talk to you first.
My wife has been surfing the internet of late and has been reading quite a lot about dyslexia.
- Just wanted to let you know. - Why tell me?
Well, I didn't want you to think that we are parents who don't really bother or care about their kids.
It has the power to heal.
Like a balm that soothes pain.
The child feels reassured that someone cares for him.
An occasional hug, a loving kiss. Just to show that I really care.
"My child, I love you.
"If you have any troubles, come to me.
"So what if you slipped, messed up? I'm there for you."
That assurance.
Caring.
Isn't that how one would describe caring, Mr Awasthi?
It's nice to hear that you think that you care.
Well, then, I'd better be going.
Mr Awasthi?
Did your wife read anything about the Solomon Islands on the internet?
I don't know. I'm not sure.
On the Solomon Islands, when the tribes need to clear the jungle to make way for fields, they don't cut down the trees.
They simply gather and collect around it, and hurl abuses at the tree, they curse it. Slowly but surely, after some days, the tree begins to wither.
It dies on its own.
Come one...come all.
Teachers and...students... ...at am-phi-the-a-tre.
Come...
There have been such gems amongst us who have changed the course of the world, because they could look at the world differently.
They were ridiculed.
But despite that, they persevered and emerged such winners that the world applauded them.
- Welcome, sir.
- See, I made it.
You have finally convinced me to become a Sunday painter.
- Welcome, ma'am. Come, please. - Thank you.
Are you OK?
Where's your Ishaan? I've been dying to meet him.
I don't know. I haven't seen him.
Rajan, where's Ishaan?
I don't know, sir.
Œóe left the hostel before anyone woke up.
Really?
Nikumbh, did you have to include the teachers in this?
- George, sir, you'll love it. Try it. - I can't handle drawing and painting.
Nikumbh!
I have decided to make a wordy painting.
I'm going to fill it with alphabets!
You seem to be limited by your language, Mr Sen.
I've come to make an appearance in front of the principal. Just 1 0 minutes.
- I'm not ruining my Sunday. - You made it, that's good enough.
Where do we sit?
You'll be shown your place by the kids.
Kids! Œóey, guys, come here.
Show these teachers their places.
- Careful. Careful! - Don't push.
Oh, you can leave my hands.
I'm coming with you, OK?
Jolly good, I'd say.
- It's a pleasure. - I'm glad you could come.
Sir, our chief guest for the day, Mrs Lalitha Lajmi.
Teacher, painter, my guru.
Namaskar. Thank you for coming.
Œóey, guys.
Seen Ishaan anywhere?
- No, sir.
- I think he must be with Rajan.
- Rajan, where is he?
- I really don't know, sir.
As I told you, he left the hostel before anyone could wake up.
Where were you, huh? Come on, sit.
You got colours?
Open the doors, draw the curtains
The wind is all tied up, let's set it free
Bring your kites, bring your colours
Let's decorate the canopy of the sky
Why are you so worried?
You're here a guest, at nature's behest
The world was made just for you
Discover yourself, know who you are
You are the sun, radiate light
You are the river, don't you know?
Flow on, fly high
You'll find your purpose where you find your happiness
Why are you so worried?
You're here a guest, at nature's behest...
Tiwari, you're still here? You said you'd be leaving in five minutes.
- What's this you're drawing?
- This is a frog, a duck and a banana.
That's a frog?
Staleness is sadness, freshness brings joy
Life is like candyfloss, spun of hopes and dreams
Savour it and hoard it in the palm of your hand
If there is thirst in you
You'll find a rain cloud round the corner
Don't let anyone come in your way
Your potential is endless like the sky
You are the sun, radiate light
You are the river, don't you know?
Flow on, fly high
You'll find your purpose where you find your happiness
Why are you so worried?
You're here a guest, at nature's behest...
Kids, what do you think of my painting? See? Tell me.
- Awesome, sir! - First prize, sir!
- Really?
First place? - Yes, sir!
Open the doors, draw the curtains
Bring your kites, bring your colours
Let's decorate the canopy of the sky
Look, the path to the skies is revealed
And the little lost star has been found again
The world is awash in starlight
The universe is aglitter
You are free
To soar unfettered
You are the sun, radiate light
You are the river, don't you know?
Flow on, fly high
You'll find your purpose where you find your happiness
What a morning this has been!
Traversing the colourful mosaic of time,
I have revisited my childhood.
Amazing. I have also visited the childhood of others.
I have made George-sir promise that he'll take lessons from Nikumbh-sir.
- Isn't that right? - Yes, sir!
But not just only me.
Sen and Tiwari, too.
Actually, both their paintings are even more terrible than mine, sir!
All right, all right.
Speaking of Nikumbh, I have got some good news.
We shall not need to look for a new art teacher, because alongside Tulips,
Nikumbh will be staying on to teach at our school as well.
And now, the moment you all have been waiting for.
Without any further ado, let me come to the result of this Art Competition.
Our chief guest, Mrs Lalitha Lajmi, was in a real fix.
Competition was very stiff. There were two paintings that caught her eye.
It was a tie.
In fact, she was of the opinion both paintings should win the award for best painting of the competition.
But that's not possible, simply because whichever painting wins, we thought that should go on the front cover of our school's yearbook.
What do we do? What do we do?
Mrs Lajmi was in a big dilemma.
After much contemplation, she has finally come to a decision.
She has completely bypassed the teacher and chosen the student!
That's right, my dear children.
Your dear beloved teacher Nikumbh has lost.
And the student he has lost to is... ...our very own nine-year-old
Ishaan Nandkishore Awasthi of Grade 3D.
Ishaan, where are you?
Ishaan! Ishaan, my boy! Get up!
Ishaan, where are you?
Sir, sir, sir! Ishaan Awasthi!
A big hand, please!
Come on, Rajan. Say bye to your friends.
It's time to go.
- Bye. - Bye, Rajan. I'll miss you.
Œóere is your son Ishaan.
And here is his painting.
Just look at it, what a masterpiece!
Œóe's a very talented boy and I'm really happy to have him in my school.
- Œóave you met the teachers? - No...no, sir.
Go and meet them.
They will give you the progress report.
Thank you so much, Mr and Mrs Dave.
Enjoy your summer holidays.
Œóello.
Œóello, come in.
Mr and Mrs Awasthi, Ishaan's parents.
- Oh! - Please, sit, sit, sit.
Your lad, eh?
Mighty spirited boy, I must say.
- What do you say, Tiwari?
- At first we thought he had a problem.
But then he showed tremendous improvement.
Very good! And what perspective.
Remarkable!
Œóere's his progress report. Take a look.
Now, that's progress. Maths, grammar and what a painter!
- A real discovery.
- Œóe is excellent. A very talented kid.
I just cannot believe this!
Thank you.
- Thank you so much. - No, don't thank us.
Thank Nikumbh.
That Pied Piper!
Œóe really turned the boy around.
Lovely boys.
Œóey...what happened?
I really don't know what to say. Œóow can I thank you?
Come on.
Œóe's a lovely boy. Just look after him.
Ishaan, Yohan! Come on.
Mama and Papa are waiting.
Œóey, champ.
I'm going to miss you.
Come back fast, eh? After the holidays.
Off you go.
- Bye, Yohan. - Bye, sir.
You are the sun, radiate light
You are the river, don't you know?
Flow on, fly high
You'll find your purpose where you find your happiness
Tonight we give you something entirely new and different.
Hi, my name's Kim Edwards and you're watching Angelocracy.
Stay right where you are...
Dont' move...
Stay there, now. Steady...
Now, sit up!
Sit up!
Sit up, you!
Up, you fool!
Up!
Sit up, I said.
Sit up!
Really, Mr. Livington!Oh, I'm sorry.
Please, let me help you.
Boss!
Oh, boss!
What's the matter?
Boss!
Take it easy, what's the matter?
Look!
Wait a minute, wait a minute...
Take it away.
Not here!
Wait a min... take it easy, Stanley!
This is harmless little kitten.
Boss, I'm scared to death.
What did he...?
Oooh, a wild look in his face!
Aw...
I can't understand why you have this terrible fear of animals in you.
What is it?
When I was a little baby I was scared by my piggy bank.
Oh, that's nonsense!
You wanna hear something worse?
What?
I was 15 years old before I ate my first animal cracker.
Come on, the store is about to open up.
Fix up your [something].
Ok, no worry.
And now... Yes, sir... That's the truth.
How are you doing?
May I help you?
Do you happen to have a copy of [name of a book] by [name of an author]?
I'll find out.
Hey, Bob!
How do you do, gentlemen?
We'd like to speak to the salesman, pal.
Well, I'm the salesman.
Stanley Livington.
I'm the clerk in charge of all jungle books.
And at eleven o'clock, I'm giving a lecture.
Yeah, yeah, yeah... You got a book by the name of...?
"Dark Safari", by [name of an author].
"Dark Safari", by [name of the author]?
We did have it.
We got rid of it sometime ago.
I wanna tell you gentlemen: I read that book, I had nightmares for nine months.
How well do you remember that book?
Why?
Remember a map in it?
A map in that book?
Of course I remember it!
Could I draw it?
Ha, ha!
For a thousand dollars I could draw that map on oil.
Draw that map in that book for a thousand dollars?
For a thousand dollars?
Okay, then meet us in the alley tonight at 7:30.
And we'll take you to somebody who'll give you a thousand dollars the minute you lay down the pencil.
It it a deal?
Shake!
Okay, pal!
See you in the alley tonight at 7:30.
And be there, chum!
Get me?
A thousand dollars... To draw that map...
I'm sorry but that book is out of print.
In fact we sold the last one sometime ago.
Oh, dear, I was afraid of that.
I've been to every bookstore in the city.
There's a map in that book that I'd give twenty five hundred dollars for.
Would you give me that again, please?
I said there was a map in that book that I'd give twenty five hundred dollars for.
Twenty five hundred dollars?
Uh... Excuse me, I'll be right back.
What are you doing?
Hey, boss... [Something I couldn't get].
There were two guys in here...
I understand.
Look, Stanley... How well do you remember that book you read about... "Dark Safari"?
That's what I'm trying to tell you.
There were two guys in here...
Now, look... You remember there was a map in it?
You too?
No, go away!
Go away!
What are you doing there?
I'm drawing that map now.
No, no, you don't!
Wait a minute!
No, you can't...
Boss!
Don't tear that up!
I got a chance to make m...
Shhh!
Wait!
Quiet!
Quiet!
Come on, follow me...
Take it easy! Take it easy!
Madam... You are the luckiest person in New York this morning.
Allow me to introduce Stanley Livington, one of the world's greatest wild game hunters.
Oh, no!
How exciting!
Wild game hunters are my weakness.
This is really a thrill, Mr. Livington.
So nice meeting you too, but I'm really not...
Wonderful!
Then you must be very familiar with the map that there's in that book.
The map?
Yes.
Oh, sure!
That's one map I could draw in a dark room being without a pencil.
You see, your troubles are all over.
I could make arrangements to bring it over to your home this evening.
Nah... Nah...
Oh, marvelous!
I think it's a wonderful idea!
Nah!
My name is [woman's name].
How do you do, Ms. [woman's last name]?
No, I got a date in the alley...
She'll have to wait!
She'll have to wait...?
Oh...!
Here's my address.
See you tonight, then.
Goodbye!
Goodbye...
That's the kind of girl I dream about.
But you should see the ones I get. I tell you boss, the guy said he knew the map backwards. So we make a day to meet him, bring him and have him draw it.
Come on! than women thing ming letting me know and although it'snot and let me no blur

[Mooji] What do you want it to do?
Why are you employing the inquiry?
That's the first thing. Why?
[Questioner]
To get through the blockade.
[M.]
To go through the blockade?
[Q.]
Yes.
[Mooji]
OK. And the blockade is comprised of what?
[Q.]
I think my mind, my ego.
[Mooji]
You can be free today!
[Mooji]
The first thing is, all of this is so incredibly simple.
We learnt that whatever happens in our mind, that somehow it blocks you from going somewhere.
I am saying that awareness, the goal of all inquiry, cannot be on the other side of working through any process. Because awareness is that within which, even the attempt, to work through to get to something, arises and is perceived.
[Friend]
Could you repeat?
[Mooji]
I want to repeat it.
Usually, I'm not good at repeating things.
I'm not good at repeating things, but this I'll repeat for you.
We have the feeling, that to get to Truth, you must work through something, some method, some process, untangle some knots, climb some mountain, sit in some cave.
And then, Truth is the prize at the end of your striving.
But awareness, which is synonymous with Truth, is that already, within which the very striving and the attempt and the practice arise and are perceived.
This is an atomic discovery!
And this is what's called the power of maya.
You think you have to go somewhere to find Truth, because you think Truth is other than you.
It's somewhere else, it's a location.
You can give it any image.
Maybe, you call it the Buddha Land or heaven, or the Buddha mind or Christ consciousness.
But in a subtle way, mind phenomenalises something like it does with enlightenment and awakening.
It's a space I'll reach where I'll be able to turn water into wine. And whatever it is that you feel, because of the stories we hear.
And these stories, I take them to be true also, that these things happen.
But they are not a condition that needs to happen to get to somewhere.
And this somewhere is right here.
You are That.
But you have not been educated to even recognize that you could be perfect from the beginning.
You think you'll be perfect at the end.
[Q.] Yes.
[Mooji]
Therefore, a journey comes into play.
The birth of all religions come out of this.
[Q.]
So do we need the journey?
[Mooji]
For a while, it seems that it's unavoidable.
That we must taste the tax for having a life.
To go through this and to taste all the inter-related opposites.
Not all, but many.
And then to come out.
It seems as though all of the sentient beings were poured into the forest of existence.
We are to make our way through it and come out into open terrain.
And every now and again, a Buddha comes out and walks on.
And a Jesus comes out and walks on.
Occasionally, one of us pops out, looks, and runs back in again. [laughter]
Some are building tree houses.
[Q.]
Yes.
[Mooji]
It's like this.
So, it's very much a part of our human mythology, that we must go through this long journey, and eventually, if you're good enough, if you are strong enough, if you try hard enough, if you focus enough, if you're detached enough, if you're lucky enough.
Then after, meaning after this, then you may get in.
[Q.]
Or may not.
[M.]
Or may not.
And we purchase it.
I'm pointing you to something: what you are, before you became. And what you timelessly are even in your play of becoming. And what you timelessly are even after the endings of your becomings.
That you are the witness of this, and you are That now.
I am prepared that there will be fierce resistance to this idea.
After all, it's too simple.
Maybe it's just another modern trick. Because we're all very lazy, which we are.
In the old days, you would spend at least 12 years with a master.
[Q.]
Yes, I spent 18.
[Mooji]
Yes.
Now we don't want to spend 12 minutes.
We want it over-the-counter.
[Q.]
Does one need to give up the journey then?
[Mooji]
To give up the journey?
If there is within you, the routine of something which you enjoy, and see that it's consciousness, if you see that consciousness is what's playing all of this, then the poison is removed from the serpent.
If you see, that it's not the individual who has to do something, but even the sense of individuality is the consciousness in expression as individuality, something beautiful happens to you.
It's not personal, it's like the play of existence.
If you follow what I'm pointing, you will be free today!
What I'm pointing at, then you will recognize your eternal freedom today.
[music] You are That!

Episode 8 &lt;i&gt;The shining era of high school has passed, and I have become a 20-year-old. &lt;i&gt;The reason that that time in high school was shining... &lt;i&gt;because of Baek Seung Jo.ÿß &lt;i&gt;I am going to have fun.
I am going to live happily. &lt;i&gt;Oh Ha Ni? &lt;i&gt;I'm asking you if you're Oh Ha Ni. &lt;i&gt;To put it simply, I hate stupid girls. &lt;i&gt; You, you!
Why did you come out from there? &lt;i&gt;Because it's my house. &lt;i&gt; I can't believe it!
To be having breakfast with Baek Seung Jo. &lt;i&gt;What to do? &lt;i&gt;Logx = log (2^30 * 10^-7), &lt;i&gt;logx = 30log2 - 7log10 logx=30*0.3-7 &lt;i&gt;For this problem we use f=ma. &lt;i&gt; Good luck. &lt;i&gt; This one. &lt;i&gt;Thank you. &lt;i&gt;What is this? &lt;i&gt;Oh Ha Ni! &lt;i&gt;Hey!
Hey! &lt;i&gt;Hey! &lt;i&gt; What I said about you being a pain, &lt;i&gt; Weren't just empty words.
Ever since I met you, I did not have one quiet day. &lt;i&gt; I told you to stop this.
How far do you intend to take this? &lt;i&gt;Please just knock it off! &lt;i&gt;Even though he's cold, I cannot stop my feelings towards him. &lt;i&gt;That's because I'm a persevering snail heading towards Seung Jo. &lt;i&gt; You're amazing, Oh Ha Ni. &lt;i&gt; You want to drink some water? &lt;i&gt;Come here. &lt;i&gt;Your girlfriend? &lt;i&gt;There's no way. &lt;i&gt; What does he mean "There is no way"? &lt;i&gt; You and Oh Ha Ni are very well suited. &lt;i&gt; Now, it's time I let go of my feelings. &lt;i&gt;Let's move out Ha Ni. &lt;i&gt;Good bye... &lt;i&gt;Baek Seung Jo.
What were you looking at?
The street down there.
People walking by and the alley... it's fun.
It's refreshing.
We'll stay here, and then we'll find a new house.
Even though it's uncomfortable, just bear with it for a little while.
I'm alright.
It's fine, and I really like this neighborhood.
Since it's an old neighborhood,and it's a little emotional.
That's right. it definitely seems homey.
Yup there is definitely
Let's go eat.
Yes.
Ha Ni, you came down?
Yeah...
Just wait a bit, I'll make it right away.
Here.
I knew you would come back!
I didn't know that we would be together this soon though.
You rascal, what do you mean by being together, huh?
Hey, give me a plate.
Ha Ni this is called yeongbap.
Come on and try it.
Father, we eat and breathe together both upstairs and downstairs.
If it's not being together then what is it?
If you're going to keep drinking Kim Chi soup and make things chaotic then just leave!
Father, how could you say something so sad.
I...
Eat.
Should I open it for you?
Have a meal.
But I don't have any appetite.
Don't just stay at home, go outside, take some photos.
And meet your friends.
Because you keep staying at home.
I don't even have anything I want to do.
Are you okay?
Isn't there anything wrong with you?
I'm great, very peaceful.
Peace?
What's the peace that you're talking about?
Not having anything you don't expect?
Being everything by yourself?
Isn't that why you were so quiet and suffocating in your own bubble?
Not going to DaeSun University and going to Parang University, didn't you do that because you hated the peace?
Please try this.
Our Ha Ni is so out of it right now that...
I'm a bit worried.
Don't you think I should cheer her up by giving her a call?
This late?
This rascal.
Ha Ni is the prettiest when she's smiling.
I'm just saying this because she's always sad now.
I'll make her return to a smiling face at once...
Couldn't you allow us to go on a night date?
You can make her return to a smiling face?
Ah, of course.
Will you allow it?
Then well...
Yes.
Ha Ni... &lt;i&gt;Not available to answer the call.
After the beep....
Ah, why?
She didn't answer.
Really?
Aigoo...
For the time being, dad said to split up some of the house chores.
Really?
Hyung, you have the cleaning, dishwashing, and the cooking.
What?!
I'm doing it all?
Should a young kid like me have to do it?
Dad has to go to work... &lt;i&gt;You're going to take the test tomorrow, right? &lt;i&gt;You can do everything. &lt;i&gt;You have to use your brains to benefit people. &lt;i&gt;I think people who has a lot should share what he has.
Good luck on your test!
FlGHTlNG!!
I thought that you would always live in that house.
You're losing your advantage little by little.
It's fine, I don't need it now.
I really gave up Baek Seung Jo.
What?
Really?
You, the one that was so stubborn?
I'm a different person now than I was before. Because I realized that there's nothing more I can do.
I won't go chasing after Baek Seung Jo again.
Ha Ni.
I've talked about it with dad, and closed my heart against him.
Now, I will look for a really cool boyfriend.
Really? &lt;i&gt;Good-bye, Baek Seung Jo.
Hey! Let's go have lunch.
I came out without the dean knowing. I have to quickly eat and go back.
Right.
I'm hungry.
I don't feel like it.
You guys go ahead.
Oh Ha Ni.
Because you're being like this, you don't seem like the Oh Ha Ni I know.
Is it because you're afraid that if you go to the cafeteria you might meet Baek Seung Jo?
If I see Seung Jo, my heart might waver again.
I really can't hold you back. I wonder if you won't be able to meet another guy because you're like this.
Even so...
I'll eat later!
Hey Oh Ha Ni.
Do you think you won't run into him when you go to the same school?
That's right!
Dok Go Min Ah said something right. It's actually good to meet him first.
Let's go.
I'm hungry!
Let's go quickly!
Let's go!
Let's go!
What do you want to have?
Huh?
Omo!
[Oh Ha Ni grew tired of Baek Seung Jo and broke up!] It's now time for a lovely mood with Bong Joon Goo.
Did you see above?
Please spread the word.
Even if you see someone you don't know, tell them about it.
Next order!
- Gogi dub bap please &lt;Br&gt; - Gogi dup bap right here
Hey Bong Joon Gu, what are you doing?!
Ha Ni, you came.
What do you want to eat today?
The Gogi Dup Bap (meat on top of rice) is really good today. Eat that.
Hey Bong Joon Gu!
I'm not in the mood to play around.
Hey Bong Joon Gu, you're causing an incident.
Hey Bong Joon Gu, what are you thinking?
If Baek Seung Jo sees this, what will Ha Ni become?
Baek Seung Jo?
He already saw it.
He's over there.
What?!
This is completely cheesy.
I'd probably get sick of it too.
You must get really tired, Baek Seung Jo.
Is this possibly a struggle to change Baek Seung Jo's interests?
Hey girl!
What did you just say?
No.
I forgot Seung Jo.
Baek Seung Jo has nothing to do with me anymore.
We don't live in one house anymore...
Just... We're strangers now.
Our Ha Ni is speaking well!
Hey Baek Seung Jo, you heard right?
You heard correctly right?
Ha Ni ah!
You're not going to eat Gogi Dup Bap?
Hey Oh Ha Ni!
Why are you being so sluggish?
Hurry up and bring the balls.
I'm really tired.
Just a little...
What did you do that you're so tired?
Stop talking and bring the balls.
Hurry!
Sunbaenim.
That racket... Could you put it down when you talk?
What?
It's nothing.
I heard you're still just picking up the balls.
Why... did you come?
Why would I have come?
I'm part of the staff here too.
No...
That's that. &lt;i&gt;I'm trying so hard to suppress my feelings.
I'm not even attending classes. &lt;i&gt;But if you just come like this, what am I supposed to do?
Ha Ni ah.
Ha Ni ah.
Seung Jo.
You're here, I have something to say to you.
Next Friday and Saturday, our Top Spin Club is going on an MT for two nights and three days. Let's go together.
I don't want to.
Why?
I came on the condition where I could come only if I wanted to.
Seung Jo ah.
Since we're players, should we make a bet with a match?
If you win, you don't have to go.
And if I win, you go.
Let's go outside and have a game.
What do you think about that ?
I don't care...
But will you really be okay?
Ah brat.
I know that you play well.
Let's just try it for fun.
Let's do a dual match.
That sounds fun.
You and Ha Ni on one team.
-Pardon?
-Pardon?
Then I... uh...
Should I play with Yoon Hae Ra?
Is your brother upstairs?
No.
He's not there.
Where did he go?
He said he didn't have class today, so he was going to stay home and read.
Earlier, he was holding a tennis bag and left.
Ahh, he went to the Tennis Club.
Have you been well?
Yeah I'm Seung Jo's mom.
I've gotten curious about something.
Do you know what club Ha Ni signed up for?
Oh my!
Really?!
Oh excuse me.
Where can I find the Tennis Club?
I came to meet a student named Oh Ha Ni.
You probably don't know Oh Ha Ni.
The club's name is Top Spin.
Ah Oh Ha Ni?
Oh my!
You know Oh Ha Ni?
Something about her breaking up with Baek Seung Jo... there was some commotion at the cafeteria.
Oh my, what?!
What kind of rumor is that?
That is all a lie!
Baek Seung Jo and Oh Ha Ni will never break up.
Those two people are doing fine!
You students tell the others too!
But then, who are you ma'am??
Who's that lady?
Excuse me.
Where should I go to find the Tennis Club?
Ah wait a min...
Possibly, Seung Jo's mother?
Ah I was right!
Hello.
Oh Joo Ri, Min Ah!
Nice to see you!
What's going on? Wearing those kinds of clothes...
Oh, I was trying to disguise.
Does it show??
It's very obvious.
Did you come to watch Ha Ni play tennis?
When you watch the Wimbledon matches, Sharapova wears those white tennis uniforms.
And she does the swishing!
Imagining Ha Ni do that, could I just sit at home?
Where are they playing?
Let's hurry up and go watch.
I think the practice is over now.
It's over?
Later tonight, Ha Ni and Seung Jo will be playing tennis on one team.
What's up with being on the same side as Seung Jo?
Yeah.
Ha Ni is desperately trying to forget Seung Jo.
Oh my.
What are you talking about?
Actually, I thought everything was going to be okay between Ha Ni and Seung Jo.
I thought that way too.
Think about it.
After graduation, they...
They even kissed.
What?!
KlSS!!!
That was on the night of graduation.
And, Baek Seung Jo did it first!
Awesome!
Seung Jo, really!
After doing that... why?!
I've made my decision.
I'm going to have Ha Ni back at our house.
Even if Seung Jo says something, it doesn't matter.
They even kissed. &lt;i&gt;Brought to you by the PKer team @ www.viikii.net
We're going to lose anyways.
So just tell them you're going to the MT.
You're saying to give up now?
Listen carefully.
You just run the opposite way from the ball.
Don't get in my way.
Understood?
Just pretend that I'm not here Don't serve me any balls, okay?
I want to go with Seung Jo to the MT.
So I don't intend to go easy on you.
Show me what you've got.
PLAY.
I told you to not get in my way!
Sorry.
0 - 15
Ah, come on!
Hey! Don't come, don't come.
Advantage.
Wang Kyung Su and Yoon Hae Ra.
This time, if we don't get the point.
It will be the game set.
Keep your mind on the game Oh Ha Ni. Got it?
Then, this is the last one.
Game set. Wang Kyung Soo and Yoon Hae Ra's win.
Yes! We won, we won!
That punk!
Thanks to you, ever since the day I was born, this is the first time I ever lost.
Feels very refreshing.
I'm sorry.
That's why, from the start...
Aigoo, Mr. Baek Seung Jo
Oh, your pride must have been hurt a lot.
Is this the first time you've lost?
I'd like to pay you back sometime.
Really?
I'm cool, whenever you want.
However, we'll stay teamed the same way we are now.
How about having it when we go on the MT?
Huh?
But the MT is next week.
Right, no matter how much of a genius you might be, 1 week is pushing it.... right?
Fine. Let's try it out.
On the last day of the MT.
Call!
We have only one week.
After one week, we'll win, for sure.
Do you understand?
Does that make any sense? When did you ever know what makes sense or not? When you asked me to raise you to the top 50 students,
Where'd that attitude go?
Now, spread your legs shoulder width apart. A little more, Yeah. Now lower your stance.
Follow me.
1 2
Put your foot forward.
3
Your right foot too.
3 You should hold the racquet
Like this...
And keep your hand like this.
3! Like so, to the right side.
Again.
Try it again.
Like this.
1 2, 3 1, 2, 3
In every sport the fundamentals are important.
Every step should be at the same pace. Keeping it steady.
Come on. Hurry, hurry.
Hey!
Here.
Now harder.
Good.
Good.
She's really trying her best.
I mean Oh Ha Ni.
Even so, what can you do with only one week?!
Well, it's fun. Oh Ha Ni has the joy of raising /teaching.
Joy of raising/ teaching?
She's amazing. It's like if she puts her mind into something and works hard, she can achieve it. Certainly,
That's because you're good at everything without having to make an effort, and having to work to death to accomplish something, you don't know anything about it.
You're right.
Follow the ball until the end.
To the right, to the right.
Keep your eyes on it until the end.
No matter how hard I try I keep closing my eyes, so I can't see. What can I do?!
I said No! How many times do I need to tell you that.
Father,
Please think about it.
If they stay for 3 nights and 2 days, something's bound to happen, right?
If you let me have a break... I can plan everything out.
Hey!
How long are you just going to chase her?
Don't just chase her.
Can't you make Ha Ni come to you?
You need to have respect.
Because you follow her around so crazily,
That's why she's not acknowledging you! Hurry up and go finish what needs to be done in the kitchen.
HEY!
Change that hairstyle of yours!
That-little- thing- That's not Ha Ni's style!
What am I really?
Even though my resolution was firm... just thinking about spending 3 days and 2 nights with Baek Seung Jo... my heart is fluttering.
What to do?
This isn't right.
Ha Ni!
Ah, Joon Gu. You came early.
Here, take this with you.
What is it?
It's a lunch box.
Joon Gu.
You have to remember,
I am your home.
Home?
Right.
A home that will always be there for you no matter what.
It's still there after you've partied so much, and even after you've sobbed because things are so tough and then you come home.
The thing that always stays the same, your home.
Hurry up and go. Be sure to come back safely. Don't hurt yourself.
Thank you. I'll eat it well.
Right.
Joon Gu!
Thank you.
Aish! This really isn't my style.
It's really tough to earn respect.
Respect....
Ah, Sunbaenim! You rascals... look at the way you're dressed. The MT of our tennis club... is for us to reside on campus... and undergo special training.
Sunbaenim! That's ridiculous!
Be quiet.
Starting now, I'll give you 5 minutes
Go back and drop your stuff at the clubroom.
And then meet here again.
Some people are not here yet,
Once everyone is here,
We'll do it.
What?
Who hasn't showed up yet?
Baek Seung Jo,Yoon Hae Ra and Oh Ha Ni. Fine. Baek Seung Jo and Yoon Hae Ra
Are special members so that's okay, But Oh Ha Nl?
What's with that punk?
Omo! Hello.
Yes.
It's a little idle right now.
Before the customers start coming for dinner...
Please take a seat.
Ah but...
People like Ha Ni always ride these.
It was so cute to me.
So I bought one, but it doesn't fit in my car.
I just brought it here.
Tell Ha Ni to ride it.
I'm not sure if it's okay to keep receiving things.
If you don't take it, then it's not okay.
And... Your mail...
Ah thank you.
I haven't been able to change the address yet.
I'm sorry.
Do you like it? Just the two of you living together?
What?
Ah well.
I got a disease... depression.
It's pretty serious.
I heard from Soo Chang.
Before Ha Ni came, at our house, the person who talked and made mistakes...
I was the only one.
Seung Jo and Eun Jo... they don't have that type of personality.
And my husband is busy.
If I don't laugh, our house turns into a depressing hole.
But when Ha Ni came, I liked it so much.
It felt like I was living.
I was happy.
Would it be okay to live together again?
You haven't changed your address yet.
I thought about it a lot.
Maybe I'm being too selfish.
That I'll be the only one that's happy.
She seemed like the perfect match for Seung Jo.
Maybe I'm being too greedy.
But... I feel like Ha Ni will be sad alone too.
Actually I was waiting for that too.
But now they're all in college, and if Seung Jo gets a new girlfriend... Rather than having a hard time moving after getting close to everyone...
I thought it might be better to hurt a little bit right now.
To Ha Ni...
We'll start tomorrow at 6:00AM.
In the morning we'll swing. In the afternoon we'll learn how to top spin.
To the people who think we're going on the MT to have fun, it's a good idea to reset that mindset.
Here here here. It's time to rest. We'll all rest and after an hour, let's meet at the front court.
Good work.
Yah Han Ni ah.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Come here.
You don't need to come to the evening training.
Why?
You're in charge of the dinner now.
By myself?
You were tardy this morning.
Think of it as a punishment and go make dinner. It's better off this way. You don't have to train.
Wait a second.
Then what about the match on the last day?
Oh that?
Of course we have to do that, since I promised.
How can you put her in charge of the food?
She needs to train more than the others.
That's your problem. She was tardy though.
Are you not letting her practice because you think you might lose?
Sunbae (Senior)
You have that low of confidence?
Ah.. that...
Hurry up with the food.
So we can train with the time leftover. I told you...
The match after tomorrow, we have to win.
It'll probably be tiring... by yourself.
You're not saying that you'll help me.
I don't really like cooking.
I have something to say.
You might have already noticed, but I'm interested in Seung Jo.
So I'm going to tell Seung Jo this time.
It should be okay, right?
Why are you asking me?
I'm not sure.
I keep feeling like I'm taking candy from a baby.
What?
Ah, it's not that.
I'm fine.
Really?
I feel better then.
Then work hard.
There's no end to this peeling.
Ah hot.
Yah Oh Ha Ni
Do you still have a lot left?
If you keep going slow like that, there won't be any time to practice.
Seung Jo ah.
Baek Seung Jo.
Help me.
I need to hurry up and finish so I can practice.
Sesame oil.
Yes!
Yah Yah Yah!&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Stop.
Ground red pepper.
Yes.
Put in a little bit.
I said just put in just a little.
Woah.
It looks so good.
Who made this?
It looks so good!
Please sit down.
Ha Ni, did you do this?
You're really great.
You can get married now.
What is all this?
It looks so delicious Ha Ni.
Woah it's really good, it's really good!
Try it, try it!
What is this?
This is quite good.
It's shrimp!
So good!
Try this.
It's really good.
Yah Baek Seung Jo.
What are you?
Give her some compliments.
Seung Jo, he's very picky.
Oh Ha Ni.
Let's go practice.
I wonder if the kids are doing okay.
It would be nice if they got closer so that she can come back.
We spent all that time together.
How can Seung Jo be so cold?
I didn't notice it when they were here.
But since Ha Ni is gone, the house seems empty and no fun.
You think that way too, don't you? Honey,
Can we ask Ki Dong shi to come live with us again?
Should I meet Ki Dong once then?
Honey, thank you so much.
Even if we live together again,
I'm not going to give up my room.
Definitely not.
1, 2 3 1, 2
How many do you have left?
Keep your hips straight.
Keep your back straight
Keep your back straight
Keeps your hips straight.
And your butt too.
Ah I can't do this.
Yah&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Get up.
Get up.
Yah!
Get up.
Quickly.
I'm tired.
Mmh.
Tired is playing tennis.
Get up.
Swing.
To the outside. Back hand.
One more time. &lt;i&gt;Brought to you by the PKer team @ www.viikii.net&lt;/i&gt;
What are you doing?
Let's do it again. &lt;i&gt;Brought to you by the PKer team @ www.viikii.net
Baek Seung Jo!
You missed the afternoon training yesterday.
Without catching up first, don't do anything else.
Will it be okay?
You'll probably regret.
What?
Then maybe I should go buy some ramen.
Ha Ni ah.
What happened with this?
Even though it looks like that, the taste should be okay.
Really?
Jong Suk.
You eat one.
Yes?
Try one.
Where did the Dae Jang Geum from yesterday go?
I'm sorry.
-Actually, I didn't make it yesterday.
-Then who made it?
You were the only one who missed the evening training.
Ah!
Baek Seung Jo.
Huh?
Seung Jo?
Good job!
Doing a good job!
Ah, you came? &lt;i&gt;What are you doing Oh Ha Ni... &lt;i&gt;What are you going to do by following them? &lt;i&gt;No, I'm not following them.
What? Is there something you wanted to tell me?
I don't know what to say..this isn't my usual style. I was second when I entered the school
I also applied to lower school than the ones that I could go.
There were some circumstances.
Is that so?
I like you.
And you?
How do you feel?
Hey.
What are you doing?
What are you doing?
Watching them.
Possibly, do you like Hae Ra?
Sh!
From the looks of it, this seems fun.
However, I'm sorry but...
I'm going to borrow her since we have a match tomorrow.
Huh?
Oh okay take her.
You're doing good.
In a position that can't even serve.
That's not it.
Come!
We're going to practice until you get it right.
Should I change my hairstyle?
It's the coolest style in my neighborhood though.
Oh Ha Ni is really working hard.
Right?
You're alright?
Yes, I'm alright.
Good Job.
You succeeded.
The speed of your serve was pretty fast too.
It works if I do it like this?
Yeah... You did well. &lt;i&gt;He smiled. &lt;i&gt;Baek Seung Jo looked at me and smiled. &lt;i&gt;To see that smiling face. &lt;i&gt;"Good Job." &lt;i&gt;To hear him say that...
Did you get hurt?
Huh?
No.
You are hurt.
Well, it isn't Oh Ha Ni to just fall (and not cause trouble).
What is it?
We'll forfeit the doubles we were going to do later.
Huh?
Injury.
No, we have to do it.
How can you do it like this?
You can't even get up.
But still.
You said we have to win...
I practiced really hard.
With your feet?
It's fine.
There's nothing we can do about it.
I'm sorry...
-Because of me...
-I wasn't even counting on winning anyways.
Get on.
Hey!
Baek Seung Jo!
You have to play the match you promised.
How can you just go?
Do we have to do the game now?
Let's set up another one soon.
Today, as you can see...
Omo! You look so cool!
Huh?
Woah.
Ah.
Who are you?
It's a little awkward.
You look like a different person.
Yeah totally!
You should have done it sooner.
What happened to your hair?
I cut it. ohh
Who is that?
Is it Seung Jo?
What's going on?
What's going on? She got hurt?
Ha Ni!
Where?
Where did you get hurt?
It seems she hurt her leg.
Sit down, sit down!
While training, she twisted her ankle.
It also seems to be weaker because of the accident from before.
Looks like you're going to have to put it in a cast again.
Try using an ankle brace
It'll be a good idea to keep it on for 6 weeks.
A half cast? Alright.
You look different.
What are you talking about, environment?
Can you say something like that right now?
Bringing someone who was healthy home like this
That's not it.
It was my fault that I got hurt. So don't say that.
That's right.
I guess If you say so.
I get it.
I'll keep my mouth shut.
Ha Ni really didn't say anything about you changing your style?
That's because she was with Baek Seung Jo.
You're so pitiful!
Though, your hair looks great!
I think so too!
You look like a totally different person. You should have done this sooner!
Hey, do you know?
Ha Ni really likes this style.
He said she didn't notice.
Ha Ni. Here eat!
Eat this too.
It's a boiled egg.
What about the other people?
It's okay.
Thank you Joon Gu.
I'll eat well.
Okay.
Ha Ni, I'm really doing my best.
Do you know? or from the movie Personal Taste you can sense... the first quote goes, "All things are not studio but location." We take it from a realistic perspective. So, location, sound, and art.
Without even knowing, I ended up coming here.
Since I already came,
How about I catch a little look of his face?
Seung Jo.
How about we go see a movie today?
There is a movie I really want to see.
What do you think?
Popcorn and two sodas.
It's 7000 won.
Let me pay. &lt;i&gt;I dreamed about going on a date together since freshman year of high school. &lt;i&gt;I would even have a fashion show the night before to pick out clothes to wear. &lt;i&gt;Watch a movie, and when it ends go window shopping together. &lt;i&gt;Then sit together at a coffee shop and chat. &lt;i&gt; All of that he's doing with Yoon Hae Ra.
I'm sorry.
Ha Ni! What are you doing here?
Sunbae!
You...
You!
Sunbae you too.
Ha Ni.
You like Seung Jo, right? I know.
And that's right, I like Hae Ra.
But Hae Ra likes Seung Jo.
Don't you think that's wrong too?
That's why, you and I should collaborate.
Collaborate?
First, since we don't really have anything planned... we'll follow them...
When we get a chance, or if it gets dangerous we can leave.
That's a little...
What's a little?
Then did we come out just to watch them have fun together?
Anyways, does Seung Jo... does he have fast hands?
Huh?
What are you talking about?
Ah touching. Skinship. This kind of stuff.
I'm not sure.
I don't think it's like that. He doesn't like doing those... Not interested...?
I don't think it'll be easy for Seung Jo to hold it in with someone as sexy as Hae Ra. &lt;i&gt;I love you. &lt;i&gt;I love you. &lt;i&gt;This is me saying this. &lt;i&gt;So... &lt;i&gt;Like I said, these are my feelings. &lt;i&gt;It's not a dream or anything, but... &lt;i&gt;Please don't let anything happen in this dark place.
I heard those two were engaged in real life.
Aigoo.
Aigoo.
I'm so sorry.
You did well!
I'm sorry.
That brat... where is he puttng that hand?
Thanks.
-Ah really. -Thanks. &lt;i&gt;What am I doing? &lt;i&gt;Sneaking around on someone else's date, planning to intrude. &lt;i&gt;I just got to see them get along in the end.
Ha Ni, they're going that way.
Let's go quickly.
What is it?
I'm thinking about stopping.
What are you talking about?
I can't watch anymore.
It's too difficult.
Ah, what's wrong all of a sudden?
We have to go, what if they make a move?
If they like each other, there's nothing we can do.
I've realized that now.
Then, are you saying that you're going to acknowledge them doing that?
I don't wan't to be made a fool of anymore.
Aish!
I'm so sorry!
How am I supposed to get rid of it?
I have to go meet my girlfriend right now!
Do you know how much this is?
I'll give you the money for dry cleaning.
Yes, the money for dry cleaning.
Dry cleaning money?
Yes.
How much...?
Ah, she's my hoobae.
I'll give it to you.
Right here.
10,000 won.($10)
Are you playing around right now?
Huh?
100,000 won ($100)?
Oh. Why are you being like this?
You're playing around with me right now, aren't you?
Huh?
This is worth 2,000,000 won ($2000)!
Then you should at least pay half.
1,000,000 won ($1000)?
Sir!
I'm only 21.
Where do I have that kind of money?
Please forgive us.
Do you want to get beat up or do you want to quietly figure it out here?
Ah please let this go and talk.
Why are you being like this?
Ha Ni!
Are you okay?
Boss.
What's going on here?
Seung Jo.
Do you have 1,000,000 won?
You're from a rich family.
Sunbae! Yes?
I will, you know...
Ah!
One, two, three.
-Hurry!
-Get them!
Get them!! &lt;i&gt;Brought to you by the PKer team @ www.viikii.net
Let's move, Ha Ni.
Bye, Baek Seung Jo.
I forgot Seung Jo.
Baek Seung Jo has nothing to do with me anymore.
What is it that you wanted to tell me?
I like you.
You?
I can't believe it.
He's really dead.
Come here.
Where are you going?
To call 911.
Are you insane! if word gets out that we have a dead guy in this house no ones ever going to come over and have sex with us ever again
Not from Scruff, from Growlr or craigslist.
Craigslist really?
You still use that?
That's your big worry right now?
We've got a dead guy in our bathtub and your worried about getting laid on gay hook up sites?
My friend Chip bought Sharon Tate's house in 1972 hasn't been laid since!
What kind of person dies at somebody's birthday party?
I mean, that's really kind of rude, right?
This is surreal.
I can't believe he's actually dead in there.
Come here baby. I am so, so sorry.
Would you please stop doing that!
So his name was Jacob?
No, it was Jim.
But you called him Jacob.
What?
No, not Jacob like the name
J Cub like J Lo
So he was gay!
Way to crack the case Sherlock Homo!
Well, did he come with you?
I didn't even know he was here.
I don't remember him at all.
You just can't get over the fact that I ended up with the looks and the talent and the non-contractual recurring role on Joey &amp; Melissa.
Excuse me, but I'm a huge fan!
You know me from TV?
No, I just think you are really hot!
That's cool.
Who the hell was that guy!
If he was here, I sure didn't see him.
What about you Reggie?
So I figured if it works for Jennifer Hudson why wouldn't the program work for me.
It's amazing.
Today I had coconut curry soup for lunch because I saved up so many points from yesterday.
You know, I've been standing here the last 20 minutes listening to you not understanding one word you're saying because you are just so damn cute.
Ooh, but so is he and I bet he talks normal.
Well I certainly don't remember him.
Can I make out with you?
There's this really creepy guy that's been following me around all night and I want him to think I have a boyfriend and there he is...is it cool?
Nope, never saw him.
I'm calling the Police!
The longer we wait the more suspicious it looks.
Alright, this is really starting to freak me out
I don't think I can handle this any more.
Come here.
I'll talk to you later.
I got to get out of here.
I have stuff I need to do today.You guys can handle it from here.
But, but, but
I should probably get going anyway and let you guys clean this whole fucking mess up.
Nelson, you have a hot ass by the way.
I'll talk to you later.
Pumpkin, they might want to question you!
Call me!!
God he's Hot!
Hot! Hot!
It's decided he's hot right? He's Hot!
Well, that's kind of weird.
Why wouldn't he want to talk to the Police?
Because he's very busy!
He's a bartender at the Eagle.
He's got huge responsibilities!
He has to slice limes and order beer and stuff!
-CHAPTER I THE STRANGE MAN'S ARRlVAL
The stranger came early in February, one wintry day, through a biting wind and a driving snow, the last snowfall of the year, over the down, walking from
Bramblehurst railway station, and carrying a little black portmanteau in his thickly gloved hand.
He was wrapped up from head to foot, and the brim of his soft felt hat hid every inch of his face but the shiny tip of his nose; the snow had piled itself against his shoulders and chest, and added a white crest to the burden he carried.
He staggered into the "Coach and Horses" more dead than alive, and flung his portmanteau down.
"A fire," he cried, "in the name of human charity!
A room and a fire!"
He stamped and shook the snow from off himself in the bar, and followed Mrs. Hall into her guest parlour to strike his bargain.
And with that much introduction, that and a couple of sovereigns flung upon the table, he took up his quarters in the inn.
Mrs. Hall lit the fire and left him there while she went to prepare him a meal with her own hands.
A guest to stop at Iping in the wintertime was an unheard-of piece of luck, let alone a guest who was no "haggler," and she was resolved to show herself worthy of her good fortune.
As soon as the bacon was well under way, and Millie, her lymphatic aid, had been brisked up a bit by a few deftly chosen expressions of contempt, she carried the cloth, plates, and glasses into the parlour and began to lay them with the utmost eclat.
Although the fire was burning up briskly, she was surprised to see that her visitor still wore his hat and coat, standing with his back to her and staring out of the window at the falling snow in the yard.
His gloved hands were clasped behind him, and he seemed to be lost in thought.
She noticed that the melting snow that still sprinkled his shoulders dripped upon her carpet.
"Can I take your hat and coat, sir?" she said, "and give them a good dry in the kitchen?" "No," he said without turning.
She was not sure she had heard him, and was about to repeat her question.
He turned his head and looked at her over his shoulder.
"I prefer to keep them on," he said with emphasis, and she noticed that he wore big blue spectacles with sidelights, and had a bush side-whisker over his coat-collar that completely hid his cheeks and face.
"Very well, sir," she said.
"As you like.
In a bit the room will be warmer."
He made no answer, and had turned his face away from her again, and Mrs. Hall, feeling that her conversational advances were ill- timed, laid the rest of the table things in a quick staccato and whisked out of the room.
When she returned he was still standing there, like a man of stone, his back hunched, his collar turned up, his dripping hat-brim turned down, hiding his face and ears completely.
She put down the eggs and bacon with considerable emphasis, and called rather than said to him, "Your lunch is served, sir."
"Thank you," he said at the same time, and did not stir until she was closing the door.
Then he swung round and approached the table with a certain eager quickness.
As she went behind the bar to the kitchen she heard a sound repeated at regular intervals.
Chirk, chirk, chirk, it went, the sound of a spoon being rapidly whisked round a basin.
"That girl!" she said.
"There!
I clean forgot it.
It's her being so long!"
And while she herself finished mixing the mustard, she gave Millie a few verbal stabs for her excessive slowness.
She had cooked the ham and eggs, laid the table, and done everything, while Millie (help indeed!) had only succeeded in delaying the mustard.
And him a new guest and wanting to stay!
Then she filled the mustard pot, and, putting it with a certain stateliness upon a gold and black tea-tray, carried it into the parlour.
She rapped and entered promptly.
As she did so her visitor moved quickly, so that she got but a glimpse of a white object disappearing behind the table.
It would seem he was picking something from the floor.
She rapped down the mustard pot on the table, and then she noticed the overcoat and hat had been taken off and put over a chair in front of the fire, and a pair of wet boots threatened rust to her steel fender.
She went to these things resolutely.
"I suppose I may have them to dry now," she said in a voice that brooked no denial.
"Leave the hat," said her visitor, in a muffled voice, and turning she saw he had raised his head and was sitting and looking at her.
For a moment she stood gaping at him, too surprised to speak.
He held a white cloth--it was a serviette he had brought with him--over the lower part of his face, so that his mouth and jaws were completely hidden, and that was the reason of his muffled voice.
But it was not that which startled Mrs. Hall.
It was the fact that all his forehead above his blue glasses was covered by a white bandage, and that another covered his ears, leaving not a scrap of his face exposed excepting only his pink, peaked nose.
It was bright, pink, and shiny just as it had been at first.
He wore a dark-brown velvet jacket with a high, black, linen-lined collar turned up about his neck.
The thick black hair, escaping as it could below and between the cross bandages, projected in curious tails and horns, giving him the strangest appearance conceivable.
This muffled and bandaged head was so unlike what she had anticipated, that for a moment she was rigid.
He did not remove the serviette, but remained holding it, as she saw now, with a brown gloved hand, and regarding her with his inscrutable blue glasses.
"Leave the hat," he said, speaking very distinctly through the white cloth.
Her nerves began to recover from the shock they had received.
She placed the hat on the chair again by the fire.
"I didn't know, sir," she began, "that--" and she stopped embarrassed.
"Thank you," he said drily, glancing from her to the door and then at her again.
"I'll have them nicely dried, sir, at once," she said, and carried his clothes out of the room.
She glanced at his white-swathed head and blue goggles again as she was going out of the door; but his napkin was still in front of his face.
She shivered a little as she closed the door behind her, and her face was eloquent of her surprise and perplexity.
"I never," she whispered.
"There!"
She went quite softly to the kitchen, and was too preoccupied to ask Millie what she was messing about with now, when she got there.
The visitor sat and listened to her retreating feet.
He glanced inquiringly at the window before he removed his serviette, and resumed his meal.
He took a mouthful, glanced suspiciously at the window, took another mouthful, then rose and, taking the serviette in his hand, walked across the room and pulled the blind down to the top of the white muslin that obscured the lower panes.
This left the room in a twilight.
This done, he returned with an easier air to the table and his meal.
"The poor soul's had an accident or an op'ration or somethin'," said Mrs. Hall.
"What a turn them bandages did give me, to be sure!"
She put on some more coal, unfolded the clothes-horse, and extended the traveller's coat upon this.
"And they goggles!
Why, he looked more like a divin' helmet than a human man!"
She hung his muffler on a corner of the horse.
"And holding that handkerchief over his mouth all the time.
Talkin' through it! ...
Perhaps his mouth was hurt too--maybe."
She turned round, as one who suddenly remembers.
When Mrs. Hall went to clear away the stranger's lunch, her idea that his mouth must also have been cut or disfigured in the accident she supposed him to have suffered, was confirmed, for he was smoking a pipe, and all the time that she was in the room he never loosened the silk muffler he had wrapped round the lower part of his face to put the mouthpiece to his lips.
Yet it was not forgetfulness, for she saw he glanced at it as it smouldered out.
He sat in the corner with his back to the window-blind and spoke now, having eaten and drunk and being comfortably warmed through, with less aggressive brevity than before.
The reflection of the fire lent a kind of red animation to his big spectacles they had lacked hitherto.
"I have some luggage," he said, "at Bramblehurst station," and he asked her how he could have it sent.
He bowed his bandaged head quite politely in acknowledgment of her explanation.
"To-morrow?" he said.
"There is no speedier delivery?" and seemed quite disappointed when she answered, "No." Was she quite sure?
No man with a trap who would go over?
Mrs. Hall, nothing loath, answered his questions and developed a conversation.
"It's a steep road by the down, sir," she said in answer to the question about a trap; and then, snatching at an opening, said, "It was there a carriage was upsettled, a year ago and more.
A gentleman killed, besides his coachman.
Accidents, sir, happen in a moment, don't they?" But the visitor was not to be drawn so easily.
"They do," he said through his muffler, eyeing her quietly through his impenetrable glasses.
"But they take long enough to get well, don't they? ...
There was my sister's son, Tom, jest cut his arm with a scythe, tumbled on it in the 'ayfield, and, bless me! he was three months tied up sir.
You'd hardly believe it. It's regular given me a dread of a scythe, sir." "I can quite understand that," said the visitor.
"He was afraid, one time, that he'd have to have an op'ration--he was that bad, sir."
The visitor laughed abruptly, a bark of a laugh that he seemed to bite and kill in his mouth.
"Was he?" he said.
"He was, sir.
And no laughing matter to them as had the doing for him, as I had--my sister being took up with her little ones so much.
There was bandages to do, sir, and bandages to undo.
So that if I may make so bold as to say it, sir--"
"Will you get me some matches?" said the visitor, quite abruptly.
"My pipe is out." Mrs. Hall was pulled up suddenly.
It was certainly rude of him, after telling him all she had done.
She gasped at him for a moment, and remembered the two sovereigns.
She went for the matches.
"Thanks," he said concisely, as she put them down, and turned his shoulder upon her and stared out of the window again.
It was altogether too discouraging.
Evidently he was sensitive on the topic of operations and bandages.
She did not "make so bold as to say," however, after all.
But his snubbing way had irritated her, and Millie had a hot time of it that afternoon.
The visitor remained in the parlour until four o'clock, without giving the ghost of an excuse for an intrusion.
For the most part he was quite still during that time; it would seem he sat in the growing darkness smoking in the firelight-- perhaps dozing.
Once or twice a curious listener might have heard him at the coals, and for the space of five minutes he was audible pacing the room.
He seemed to be talking to himself.
Then the armchair creaked as he sat down again.
CHAPTER II MR. TEDDY HENFREY'S FlRST IMPRESSlONS
At four o'clock, when it was fairly dark and Mrs. Hall was screwing up her courage to go in and ask her visitor if he would take some tea, Teddy Henfrey, the clock- jobber, came into the bar.
Mrs. Hall," said he, "but this is terrible weather for thin boots!" The snow outside was falling faster.
Mrs. Hall agreed, and then noticed he had his bag with him.
"Now you're here, Mr. Teddy," said she, "I'd be glad if you'd give th' old clock in the parlour a bit of a look.
'Tis going, and it strikes well and hearty; but the hour-hand won't do nuthin' but point at six." And leading the way, she went across to the parlour door and rapped and entered.
Her visitor, she saw as she opened the door, was seated in the armchair before the fire, dozing it would seem, with his bandaged head drooping on one side.
The only light in the room was the red glow from the fire--which lit his eyes like adverse railway signals, but left his downcast face in darkness--and the scanty vestiges of the day that came in through the open door.
Everything was ruddy, shadowy, and indistinct to her, the more so since she had just been lighting the bar lamp, and her eyes were dazzled.
But for a second it seemed to her that the man she looked at had an enormous mouth wide open--a vast and incredible mouth that swallowed the whole of the lower portion of his face.
It was the sensation of a moment: the white-bound head, the monstrous goggle eyes, and this huge yawn below it.
Then he stirred, started up in his chair, put up his hand.
She opened the door wide, so that the room was lighter, and she saw him more clearly, with the muffler held up to his face just as she had seen him hold the serviette before.
The shadows, she fancied, had tricked her.
"Would you mind, sir, this man a-coming to look at the clock, sir?" she said, recovering from the momentary shock.
"Look at the clock?" he said, staring round in a drowsy manner, and speaking over his hand, and then, getting more fully awake, "certainly."
Mrs. Hall went away to get a lamp, and he rose and stretched himself.
Then came the light, and Mr. Teddy Henfrey, entering, was confronted by this bandaged person.
He was, he says, "taken aback." "Good afternoon," said the stranger, regarding him--as Mr. Henfrey says, with a vivid sense of the dark spectacles--"like a lobster."
"I hope," said Mr. Henfrey, "that it's no intrusion."
"None whatever," said the stranger.
"Though, I understand," he said turning to Mrs. Hall, "that this room is really to be mine for my own private use." "I thought, sir," said Mrs. Hall, "you'd prefer the clock--"
"Certainly," said the stranger, "certainly- -but, as a rule, I like to be alone and undisturbed.
"But I'm really glad to have the clock seen to," he said, seeing a certain hesitation in Mr. Henfrey's manner.
"Very glad."
Mr. Henfrey had intended to apologise and withdraw, but this anticipation reassured him.
The stranger turned round with his back to the fireplace and put his hands behind his back.
"And presently," he said, "when the clock- mending is over, I think I should like to have some tea.
But not till the clock-mending is over."
Mrs. Hall was about to leave the room--she made no conversational advances this time, because she did not want to be snubbed in front of Mr. Henfrey--when her visitor asked her if she had made any arrangements about his boxes at Bramblehurst.
She told him she had mentioned the matter to the postman, and that the carrier could bring them over on the morrow.
"You are certain that is the earliest?" he said.
She was certain, with a marked coldness.
"I should explain," he added, "what I was really too cold and fatigued to do before, that I am an experimental investigator." "Indeed, sir," said Mrs. Hall, much impressed.
"And my baggage contains apparatus and appliances."
"Very useful things indeed they are, sir," said Mrs. Hall.
"And I'm very naturally anxious to get on with my inquiries."
"Of course, sir."
"My reason for coming to Iping," he proceeded, with a certain deliberation of manner, "was ... a desire for solitude.
I do not wish to be disturbed in my work.
In addition to my work, an accident--"
"I thought as much," said Mrs. Hall to herself. "--necessitates a certain retirement.
My eyes--are sometimes so weak and painful that I have to shut myself up in the dark for hours together.
Lock myself up.
Sometimes--now and then.
Not at present, certainly.
At such times the slightest disturbance, the entry of a stranger into the room, is a source of excruciating annoyance to me--it is well these things should be understood."
"Certainly, sir," said Mrs. Hall.
"And if I might make so bold as to ask--"
"That I think, is all," said the stranger, with that quietly irresistible air of finality he could assume at will.
Mrs. Hall reserved her question and sympathy for a better occasion.
After Mrs. Hall had left the room, he remained standing in front of the fire, glaring, so Mr. Henfrey puts it, at the clock-mending.
Mr. Henfrey not only took off the hands of the clock, and the face, but extracted the works; and he tried to work in as slow and quiet and unassuming a manner as possible.
He worked with the lamp close to him, and the green shade threw a brilliant light upon his hands, and upon the frame and wheels, and left the rest of the room shadowy.
When he looked up, coloured patches swam in his eyes.
Being constitutionally of a curious nature, he had removed the works--a quite unnecessary proceeding--with the idea of delaying his departure and perhaps falling into conversation with the stranger.
But the stranger stood there, perfectly silent and still.
So still, it got on Henfrey's nerves.
He felt alone in the room and looked up, and there, grey and dim, was the bandaged head and huge blue lenses staring fixedly, with a mist of green spots drifting in front of them.
It was so uncanny to Henfrey that for a minute they remained staring blankly at one another.
Then Henfrey looked down again.
Very uncomfortable position!
One would like to say something.
Should he remark that the weather was very cold for the time of year?
He looked up as if to take aim with that introductory shot.
"The weather--" he began.
"Why don't you finish and go?" said the rigid figure, evidently in a state of painfully suppressed rage.
"All you've got to do is to fix the hour- hand on its axle.
You're simply humbugging--" "Certainly, sir--one minute more.
I overlooked--" and Mr. Henfrey finished and went.
But he went feeling excessively annoyed.
"Damn it!" said Mr. Henfrey to himself, trudging down the village through the thawing snow; "a man must do a clock at times, sure-ly."
And again "Can't a man look at you?--Ugly!"
And yet again, "Seemingly not.
If the police was wanting you you couldn't be more wropped and bandaged."
At Gleeson's corner he saw Hall, who had recently married the stranger's hostess at the "Coach and Horses," and who now drove the Iping conveyance, when occasional people required it, to Sidderbridge
Junction, coming towards him on his return from that place.
Hall had evidently been "stopping a bit" at Sidderbridge, to judge by his driving. "'Ow do, Teddy?" he said, passing.
"You got a rum un up home!" said Teddy.
Hall very sociably pulled up.
"What's that?" he asked.
"Rum-looking customer stopping at the
'Coach and Horses,'" said Teddy.
"My sakes!" And he proceeded to give Hall a vivid description of his grotesque guest.
"Looks a bit like a disguise, don't it?
I'd like to see a man's face if I had him stopping in my place," said Henfrey.
"But women are that trustful--where strangers are concerned.
He's took your rooms and he ain't even given a name, Hall."
"You don't say so!" said Hall, who was a man of sluggish apprehension.
"Yes," said Teddy.
"By the week.
Whatever he is, you can't get rid of him under the week.
And he's got a lot of luggage coming to- morrow, so he says.
Let's hope it won't be stones in boxes, Hall."
He told Hall how his aunt at Hastings had been swindled by a stranger with empty portmanteaux.
Altogether he left Hall vaguely suspicious.
"Get up, old girl," said Hall.
"I s'pose I must see 'bout this." Teddy trudged on his way with his mind considerably relieved.
Instead of "seeing 'bout it," however, Hall on his return was severely rated by his wife on the length of time he had spent in Sidderbridge, and his mild inquiries were answered snappishly and in a manner not to the point.
But the seed of suspicion Teddy had sown germinated in the mind of Mr. Hall in spite of these discouragements.
"You wim' don't know everything," said Mr. Hall, resolved to ascertain more about the personality of his guest at the earliest possible opportunity.
And after the stranger had gone to bed, which he did about half-past nine, Mr. Hall went very aggressively into the parlour and looked very hard at his wife's furniture, just to show that the stranger wasn't master there, and scrutinised closely and a little contemptuously a sheet of mathematical computations the stranger had left.
When retiring for the night he instructed Mrs. Hall to look very closely at the stranger's luggage when it came next day.
"You mind you own business, Hall," said
Mrs. Hall, "and I'll mind mine."
She was all the more inclined to snap at Hall because the stranger was undoubtedly an unusually strange sort of stranger, and she was by no means assured about him in her own mind.
In the middle of the night she woke up dreaming of huge white heads like turnips, that came trailing after her, at the end of interminable necks, and with vast black eyes.
But being a sensible woman, she subdued her terrors and turned over and went to sleep again. &gt;
-CHAPTER ill THE THOUSAND AND ONE BOTTLES
So it was that on the twenty-ninth day of February, at the beginning of the thaw, this singular person fell out of infinity into Iping village.
Next day his luggage arrived through the slush--and very remarkable luggage it was.
There were a couple of trunks indeed, such as a rational man might need, but in addition there were a box of books--big, fat books, of which some were just in an incomprehensible handwriting--and a dozen or more crates, boxes, and cases, containing objects packed in straw, as it seemed to Hall, tugging with a casual curiosity at the straw--glass bottles.
The stranger, muffled in hat, coat, gloves, and wrapper, came out impatiently to meet
Fearenside's cart, while Hall was having a word or so of gossip preparatory to helping being them in.
Out he came, not noticing Fearenside's dog, who was sniffing in a dilettante spirit at
Hall's legs.
"Come along with those boxes," he said.
"I've been waiting long enough."
And he came down the steps towards the tail of the cart as if to lay hands on the smaller crate.
No sooner had Fearenside's dog caught sight of him, however, than it began to bristle and growl savagely, and when he rushed down the steps it gave an undecided hop, and then sprang straight at his hand.
"Whup!" cried Hall, jumping back, for he was no hero with dogs, and Fearenside howled, "Lie down!" and snatched his whip.
They saw the dog's teeth had slipped the hand, heard a kick, saw the dog execute a flanking jump and get home on the stranger's leg, and heard the rip of his trousering.
Then the finer end of Fearenside's whip reached his property, and the dog, yelping with dismay, retreated under the wheels of the waggon.
It was all the business of a swift half- minute.
No one spoke, everyone shouted.
The stranger glanced swiftly at his torn glove and at his leg, made as if he would stoop to the latter, then turned and rushed swiftly up the steps into the inn.
They heard him go headlong across the passage and up the uncarpeted stairs to his bedroom.
"You brute, you!" said Fearenside, climbing off the waggon with his whip in his hand, while the dog watched him through the wheel.
"Come here," said Fearenside--"You'd better."
Hall had stood gaping.
"He wuz bit," said Hall.
"I'd better go and see to en," and he trotted after the stranger.
He met Mrs. Hall in the passage.
"Carrier's darg," he said "bit en."
He went straight upstairs, and the stranger's door being ajar, he pushed it open and was entering without any ceremony, being of a naturally sympathetic turn of mind.
The blind was down and the room dim.
He caught a glimpse of a most singular thing, what seemed a handless arm waving towards him, and a face of three huge indeterminate spots on white, very like the face of a pale pansy.
Then he was struck violently in the chest, hurled back, and the door slammed in his face and locked.
It was so rapid that it gave him no time to observe.
A waving of indecipherable shapes, a blow, and a concussion.
There he stood on the dark little landing, wondering what it might be that he had seen.
A couple of minutes after, he rejoined the little group that had formed outside the
"Coach and Horses."
There was Fearenside telling about it all over again for the second time; there was
Mrs. Hall saying his dog didn't have no business to bite her guests; there was
Huxter, the general dealer from over the road, interrogative; and Sandy Wadgers from the forge, judicial; besides women and children, all of them saying fatuities:
"Wouldn't let en bite me, I knows";
"'Tasn't right have such dargs"; "Whad 'e bite 'n for, than?" and so forth.
Mr. Hall, staring at them from the steps and listening, found it incredible that he had seen anything so very remarkable happen upstairs.
Besides, his vocabulary was altogether too limited to express his impressions.
"He don't want no help, he says," he said in answer to his wife's inquiry.
"We'd better be a-takin' of his luggage in."
"He ought to have it cauterised at once," said Mr. Huxter; "especially if it's at all inflamed."
"I'd shoot en, that's what I'd do," said a lady in the group.
Suddenly the dog began growling again.
"Come along," cried an angry voice in the doorway, and there stood the muffled stranger with his collar turned up, and his hat-brim bent down.
"The sooner you get those things in the better I'll be pleased."
It is stated by an anonymous bystander that his trousers and gloves had been changed.
"Was you hurt, sir?" said Fearenside.
"I'm rare sorry the darg--" "Not a bit," said the stranger.
"Never broke the skin.
Hurry up with those things."
He then swore to himself, so Mr. Hall asserts.
Directly the first crate was, in accordance with his directions, carried into the parlour, the stranger flung himself upon it with extraordinary eagerness, and began to unpack it, scattering the straw with an utter disregard of Mrs. Hall's carpet.
And from it he began to produce bottles-- little fat bottles containing powders, small and slender bottles containing coloured and white fluids, fluted blue bottles labeled Poison, bottles with round bodies and slender necks, large green-glass bottles, large white-glass bottles, bottles with glass stoppers and frosted labels, bottles with fine corks, bottles with bungs, bottles with wooden caps, wine bottles, salad-oil bottles--putting them in rows on the chiffonnier, on the mantel, on the table under the window, round the floor, on the bookshelf--everywhere.
The chemist's shop in Bramblehurst could not boast half so many.
Quite a sight it was.
Crate after crate yielded bottles, until all six were empty and the table high with straw; the only things that came out of these crates besides the bottles were a number of test-tubes and a carefully packed balance.
And directly the crates were unpacked, the stranger went to the window and set to work, not troubling in the least about the litter of straw, the fire which had gone out, the box of books outside, nor for the trunks and other luggage that had gone upstairs.
When Mrs. Hall took his dinner in to him, he was already so absorbed in his work, pouring little drops out of the bottles into test-tubes, that he did not hear her until she had swept away the bulk of the straw and put the tray on the table, with some little emphasis perhaps, seeing the state that the floor was in. Then he half turned his head and immediately turned it away again.
But she saw he had removed his glasses; they were beside him on the table, and it seemed to her that his eye sockets were extraordinarily hollow.
He put on his spectacles again, and then turned and faced her.
She was about to complain of the straw on the floor when he anticipated her.
"I wish you wouldn't come in without knocking," he said in the tone of abnormal exasperation that seemed so characteristic of him.
"I knocked, but seemingly--"
"Perhaps you did.
But in my investigations--my really very urgent and necessary investigations--the slightest disturbance, the jar of a door--I must ask you--"
You can turn the lock if you're like that, you know.
"A very good idea," said the stranger.
If the straw makes trouble put it down in the bill."
"Don't.
And he mumbled at her--words suspiciously like curses.
He was so odd, standing there, so aggressive and explosive, bottle in one hand and test-tube in the other, that Mrs. Hall was quite alarmed.
But she was a resolute woman.
"In which case, I should like to know, sir, what you consider--"
"A shilling--put down a shilling.
Surely a shilling's enough?"
"So be it," said Mrs. Hall, taking up the table-cloth and beginning to spread it over the table.
"If you're satisfied, of course--"
He turned and sat down, with his coat- collar toward her.
All the afternoon he worked with the door locked and, as Mrs. Hall testifies, for the most part in silence.
But once there was a concussion and a sound of bottles ringing together as though the table had been hit, and the smash of a bottle flung violently down, and then a rapid pacing athwart the room.
Fearing "something was the matter," she went to the door and listened, not caring to knock.
"I can't go on," he was raving.
"I can't go on.
Three hundred thousand, four hundred thousand!
The huge multitude!
Cheated!
All my life it may take me! ...
Patience!
Patience indeed! ...
Fool! fool!"
There was a noise of hobnails on the bricks in the bar, and Mrs. Hall had very reluctantly to leave the rest of his soliloquy.
When she returned the room was silent again, save for the faint crepitation of his chair and the occasional clink of a bottle.
It was all over; the stranger had resumed work.
When she took in his tea she saw broken glass in the corner of the room under the concave mirror, and a golden stain that had been carelessly wiped.
She called attention to it.
"Put it down in the bill," snapped her visitor.
"For God's sake don't worry me.
If there's damage done, put it down in the bill," and he went on ticking a list in the exercise book before him.
"I'll tell you something," said Fearenside, mysteriously.
It was late in the afternoon, and they were in the little beer-shop of Iping Hanger.
"This chap you're speaking of, what my dog bit.
Well--he's black.
Leastways, his legs are.
I seed through the tear of his trousers and the tear of his glove.
You'd have expected a sort of pinky to show, wouldn't you?
Well--there wasn't none.
Just blackness.
I tell you, he's as black as my hat."
"My sakes!" said Henfrey.
"It's a rummy case altogether.
Why, his nose is as pink as paint!" "That's true," said Fearenside.
"I knows that.
And it's the common way with horses, as any one can see."
And he's ashamed of it.
He's a kind of half-breed, and the colour's come off patchy instead of mixing.
I've heard of such things before.
CHAPTER IV MR. CUSS INTERVlEWS THE STRANGER
I have told the circumstances of the stranger's arrival in Iping with a certain fulness of detail, in order that the curious impression he created may be understood by the reader.
But excepting two odd incidents, the circumstances of his stay until the extraordinary day of the club festival may be passed over very cursorily.
There were a number of skirmishes with Mrs. Hall on matters of domestic discipline, but in every case until late April, when the first signs of penury began, he over-rode her by the easy expedient of an extra payment.
Hall did not like him, and whenever he dared he talked of the advisability of getting rid of him; but he showed his dislike chiefly by concealing it ostentatiously, and avoiding his visitor as much as possible.
"Wait till the summer," said Mrs. Hall sagely, "when the artisks are beginning to come.
Then we'll see. He may be a bit overbearing, but bills settled punctual is bills settled punctual, whatever you'd like to say."
The stranger did not go to church, and indeed made no difference between Sunday and the irreligious days, even in costume.
He worked, as Mrs. Hall thought, very fitfully.
Some days he would come down early and be continuously busy.
On others he would rise late, pace his room, fretting audibly for hours together, smoke, sleep in the armchair by the fire.
Communication with the world beyond the village he had none.
His temper continued very uncertain; for the most part his manner was that of a man suffering under almost unendurable provocation, and once or twice things were snapped, torn, crushed, or broken in spasmodic gusts of violence.
He seemed under a chronic irritation of the greatest intensity.
His habit of talking to himself in a low voice grew steadily upon him, but though
Mrs. Hall listened conscientiously she could make neither head nor tail of what she heard.
He rarely went abroad by daylight, but at twilight he would go out muffled up invisibly, whether the weather were cold or not, and he chose the loneliest paths and those most overshadowed by trees and banks.
His goggling spectacles and ghastly bandaged face under the penthouse of his hat, came with a disagreeable suddenness out of the darkness upon one or two home- going labourers, and Teddy Henfrey, tumbling out of the "Scarlet Coat" one night, at half-past nine, was scared shamefully by the stranger's skull-like head (he was walking hat in hand) lit by the sudden light of the opened inn door.
Such children as saw him at nightfall dreamt of bogies, and it seemed doubtful whether he disliked boys more than they disliked him, or the reverse; but there was certainly a vivid enough dislike on either side.
It was inevitable that a person of so remarkable an appearance and bearing should form a frequent topic in such a village as Iping.
Opinion was greatly divided about his occupation.
Mrs. Hall was sensitive on the point.
When questioned, she explained very carefully that he was an "experimental investigator," going gingerly over the syilables as one who dreads pitfalls.
When asked what an experimental investigator was, she would say with a touch of superiority that most educated people knew such things as that, and would thus explain that he "discovered things."
Her visitor had had an accident, she said, which temporarily discoloured his face and hands, and being of a sensitive disposition, he was averse to any public notice of the fact.
Out of her hearing there was a view largely entertained that he was a criminal trying to escape from justice by wrapping himself up so as to conceal himself altogether from the eye of the police.
This idea sprang from the brain of Mr. Teddy Henfrey.
No crime of any magnitude dating from the middle or end of February was known to have occurred.
Elaborated in the imagination of Mr. Gould, the probationary assistant in the National
School, this theory took the form that the stranger was an Anarchist in disguise, preparing explosives, and he resolved to undertake such detective operations as his time permitted.
These consisted for the most part in looking very hard at the stranger whenever they met, or in asking people who had never seen the stranger, leading questions about him.
But he detected nothing.
Another school of opinion followed Mr. Fearenside, and either accepted the piebald view or some modification of it; as, for instance, Silas Durgan, who was heard to assert that "if he choses to show enself at fairs he'd make his fortune in no time," and being a bit of a theologian, compared the stranger to the man with the one talent.
Yet another view explained the entire matter by regarding the stranger as a harmless lunatic.
That had the advantage of accounting for everything straight away.
Between these main groups there were waverers and compromisers.
Sussex folk have few superstitions, and it was only after the events of early April that the thought of the supernatural was first whispered in the village.
Even then it was only credited among the women folk.
But whatever they thought of him, people in Iping, on the whole, agreed in disliking him.
His irritability, though it might have been comprehensible to an urban brain-worker, was an amazing thing to these quiet Sussex villagers.
The frantic gesticulations they surprised now and then, the headlong pace after nightfall that swept him upon them round quiet corners, the inhuman bludgeoning of all tentative advances of curiosity, the taste for twilight that led to the closing of doors, the pulling down of blinds, the extinction of candles and lamps--who could agree with such goings on?
They drew aside as he passed down the village, and when he had gone by, young humourists would up with coat-collars and down with hat-brims, and go pacing nervously after him in imitation of his occult bearing.
There was a song popular at that time called "The Bogey Man".
Miss Statchell sang it at the schoolroom concert (in aid of the church lamps), and thereafter whenever one or two of the villagers were gathered together and the stranger appeared, a bar or so of this tune, more or less sharp or flat, was whistled in the midst of them.
Also belated little children would call "Bogey Man!" after him, and make off tremulously elated.
Cuss, the general practitioner, was devoured by curiosity.
The bandages excited his professional interest, the report of the thousand and one bottles aroused his jealous regard.
All through April and May he coveted an opportunity of talking to the stranger, and at last, towards Whitsuntide, he could stand it no longer, but hit upon the subscription-list for a village nurse as an excuse.
He was surprised to find that Mr. Hall did not know his guest's name.
"He give a name," said Mrs. Hall--an assertion which was quite unfounded--"but I didn't rightly hear it." She thought it seemed so silly not to know the man's name.
Cuss rapped at the parlour door and entered.
There was a fairly audible imprecation from within.
"Pardon my intrusion," said Cuss, and then the door closed and cut Mrs. Hall off from the rest of the conversation.
She could hear the murmur of voices for the next ten minutes, then a cry of surprise, a stirring of feet, a chair flung aside, a bark of laughter, quick steps to the door, and Cuss appeared, his face white, his eyes staring over his shoulder.
He left the door open behind him, and without looking at her strode across the hall and went down the steps, and she heard his feet hurrying along the road.
He carried his hat in his hand.
She stood behind the door, looking at the open door of the parlour.
Then she heard the stranger laughing quietly, and then his footsteps came across the room.
She could not see his face where she stood.
Cuss went straight up the village to
Bunting the vicar.
"Am I mad?" Cuss began abruptly, as he entered the shabby little study.
"Do I look like an insane person?"
"What's happened?" said the vicar, putting the ammonite on the loose sheets of his forth-coming sermon.
"That chap at the inn--"
"Well?"
"Give me something to drink," said Cuss, and he sat down.
When his nerves had been steadied by a glass of cheap sherry--the only drink the good vicar had available--he told him of the interview he had just had.
"Went in," he gasped, "and began to demand a subscription for that Nurse Fund.
He'd stuck his hands in his pockets as I came in, and he sat down lumpily in his chair.
I told him I'd heard he took an interest in scientific things.
He said yes.
Sniffed again.
Kept on sniffing all the time; evidently recently caught an infernal cold.
No wonder, wrapped up like that!
I developed the nurse idea, and all the while kept my eyes open.
Bottles--chemicals--everywhere.
Balance, test-tubes in stands, and a smell of--evening primrose.
Would he subscribe?
Said he'd consider it.
Asked him, point-blank, was he researching.
Said he was.
A long research?
Got quite cross.
'A damnable long research,' said he, blowing the cork out, so to speak.
'Oh,' said I. And out came the grievance.
The man was just on the boil, and my question boiled him over.
He had been given a prescription, most valuable prescription--what for he wouldn't say.
Was it medical?
'Damn you!
What are you fishing after?' I apologised.
Dignified sniff and cough.
He resumed.
He'd read it.
Five ingredients.
Put it down; turned his head.
Draught of air from window lifted the paper.
Swish, rustle.
He was working in a room with an open fireplace, he said.
Rushed towards it just as it whisked up the chimney.
So!
Just at that point, to illustrate his story, out came his arm."
"Well?" "No hand--just an empty sleeve.
Lord!
I thought, that's a deformity! Got a cork arm, I suppose, and has taken it off. Then, I thought, there's something odd in that.
What the devil keeps that sleeve up and open, if there's nothing in it?
There was nothing in it, I tell you.
Nothing down it, right down to the joint.
I could see right down it to the elbow, and there was a glimmer of light shining through a tear of the cloth.
'Good God!'
I said.
Stared at me with those black goggles of his, and then at his sleeve." "Well?"
"That's all.
He never said a word; just glared, and put his sleeve back in his pocket quickly.
'I was saying,' said he, 'that there was the prescription burning, wasn't I?'
Interrogative cough.
'How the devil,' said I, 'can you move an empty sleeve like that?'
'Empty sleeve?' 'Yes,' said I, 'an empty sleeve.' "'It's an empty sleeve, is it?
You saw it was an empty sleeve?' He stood up right away.
I stood up too. He came towards me in three very slow steps, and stood quite close.
Sniffed venomously.
I didn't flinch, though I'm hanged if that bandaged knob of his, and those blinkers, aren't enough to unnerve any one, coming quietly up to you. "'You said it was an empty sleeve?' he said.
'Certainly,' I said.
At staring and saying nothing a barefaced man, unspectacled, starts scratch.
Then very quietly he pulled his sleeve out of his pocket again, and raised his arm towards me as though he would show it to me again.
He did it very, very slowly.
I looked at it.
Seemed an age.
'Well?' said I, clearing my throat, 'there's nothing in it.'
"Had to say something.
I was beginning to feel frightened.
I could see right down it.
He extended it straight towards me, slowly, slowly--just like that--until the cuff was six inches from my face.
Queer thing to see an empty sleeve come at you like that!
And then--" "Well?"
"Something--exactly like a finger and thumb it felt--nipped my nose."
Bunting began to laugh.
"There wasn't anything there!" said Cuss, his voice running up into a shriek at the
"there."
"It's all very well for you to laugh, but I tell you I was so startled, I hit his cuff hard, and turned around, and cut out of the room--I left him--"
Cuss stopped.
There was no mistaking the sincerity of his panic.
He turned round in a helpless way and took a second glass of the excellent vicar's very inferior sherry.
"When I hit his cuff," said Cuss, "I tell you, it felt exactly like hitting an arm.
And there wasn't an arm!
There wasn't the ghost of an arm!"
Mr. Bunting thought it over.
He looked suspiciously at Cuss.
"It's a most remarkable story," he said.
He looked very wise and grave indeed.
"It's really," said Mr. Bunting with judicial emphasis, "a most remarkable story." &gt;
-CHAPTER V THE BURGLARY AT THE VlCARAGE
The facts of the burglary at the vicarage came to us chiefly through the medium of the vicar and his wife.
It occurred in the small hours of Whit Monday, the day devoted in Iping to the
Club festivities.
Mrs. Bunting, it seems, woke up suddenly in the stillness that comes before the dawn, with the strong impression that the door of their bedroom had opened and closed.
She did not arouse her husband at first, but sat up in bed listening.
She then distinctly heard the pad, pad, pad of bare feet coming out of the adjoining dressing-room and walking along the passage towards the staircase.
As soon as she felt assured of this, she aroused the Rev. Mr. Bunting as quietly as possible.
He did not strike a light, but putting on his spectacles, her dressing-gown and his bath slippers, he went out on the landing to listen.
He heard quite distinctly a fumbling going on at his study desk down-stairs, and then a violent sneeze.
At that he returned to his bedroom, armed himself with the most obvious weapon, the poker, and descended the staircase as noiselessly as possible.
Mrs. Bunting came out on the landing.
The hour was about four, and the ultimate darkness of the night was past.
There was a faint shimmer of light in the hall, but the study doorway yawned impenetrably black.
Everything was still except the faint creaking of the stairs under Mr. Bunting's tread, and the slight movements in the study.
Then something snapped, the drawer was opened, and there was a rustle of papers.
Then came an imprecation, and a match was struck and the study was flooded with yellow light.
Mr. Bunting was now in the hall, and through the crack of the door he could see the desk and the open drawer and a candle burning on the desk.
But the robber he could not see.
He stood there in the hall undecided what to do, and Mrs. Bunting, her face white and intent, crept slowly downstairs after him.
One thing kept Mr. Bunting's courage; the persuasion that this burglar was a resident in the village.
They heard the chink of money, and realised that the robber had found the housekeeping reserve of gold--two pounds ten in half sovereigns altogether.
At that sound Mr. Bunting was nerved to abrupt action.
Gripping the poker firmly, he rushed into the room, closely followed by Mrs. Bunting.
"Surrender!" cried Mr. Bunting, fiercely, and then stooped amazed.
Apparently the room was perfectly empty.
Yet their conviction that they had, that very moment, heard somebody moving in the room had amounted to a certainty.
For half a minute, perhaps, they stood gaping, then Mrs. Bunting went across the room and looked behind the screen, while Mr. Bunting, by a kindred impulse, peered under the desk.
Then Mrs. Bunting turned back the window- curtains, and Mr. Bunting looked up the chimney and probed it with the poker.
Then Mrs. Bunting scrutinised the waste- paper basket and Mr. Bunting opened the lid of the coal-scuttle.
Then they came to a stop and stood with eyes interrogating each other.
"I could have sworn--" said Mr. Bunting.
"The candle!" said Mr. Bunting.
"Who lit the candle?" "The drawer!" said Mrs. Bunting.
"And the money's gone!"
She went hastily to the doorway.
"Of all the strange occurrences--"
There was a violent sneeze in the passage.
They rushed out, and as they did so the kitchen door slammed.
"Bring the candle," said Mr. Bunting, and led the way.
They both heard a sound of bolts being hastily shot back.
As he opened the kitchen door he saw through the scullery that the back door was just opening, and the faint light of early dawn displayed the dark masses of the garden beyond.
He is certain that nothing went out of the door.
It opened, stood open for a moment, and then closed with a slam.
As it did so, the candle Mrs. Bunting was carrying from the study flickered and flared.
It was a minute or more before they entered the kitchen.
The place was empty.
They refastened the back door, examined the kitchen, pantry, and scullery thoroughly, and at last went down into the cellar.
There was not a soul to be found in the house, search as they would.
Daylight found the vicar and his wife, a quaintly-costumed little couple, still marvelling about on their own ground floor by the unnecessary light of a guttering candle.
CHAPTER VI THE FURNlTURE THAT WENT MAD
Now it happened that in the early hours of Whit Monday, before Millie was hunted out for the day, Mr. Hall and Mrs. Hall both rose and went noiselessly down into the cellar.
Their business there was of a private nature, and had something to do with the specific gravity of their beer.
They had hardly entered the cellar when Mrs. Hall found she had forgotten to bring down a bottle of sarsaparilla from their joint-room.
As she was the expert and principal operator in this affair, Hall very properly went upstairs for it.
On the landing he was surprised to see that the stranger's door was ajar.
He went on into his own room and found the bottle as he had been directed.
But returning with the bottle, he noticed that the bolts of the front door had been shot back, that the door was in fact simply on the latch.
And with a flash of inspiration he connected this with the stranger's room upstairs and the suggestions of Mr. Teddy Henfrey.
He distinctly remembered holding the candle while Mrs. Hall shot these bolts overnight.
At the sight he stopped, gaping, then with the bottle still in his hand went upstairs again.
He rapped at the stranger's door.
There was no answer.
He rapped again; then pushed the door wide open and entered.
It was as he expected.
The bed, the room also, was empty.
And what was stranger, even to his heavy intelligence, on the bedroom chair and along the rail of the bed were scattered the garments, the only garments so far as he knew, and the bandages of their guest.
His big slouch hat even was cocked jauntily over the bed-post.
As Hall stood there he heard his wife's voice coming out of the depth of the cellar, with that rapid telescoping of the syilables and interrogative cocking up of the final words to a high note, by which the West Sussex villager is wont to indicate a brisk impatience.
"George!
You gart whad a wand?"
At that he turned and hurried down to her.
"Janny," he said, over the rail of the cellar steps, "'tas the truth what Henfrey sez.
'E's not in uz room, 'e en't.
And the front door's onbolted."
At first Mrs. Hall did not understand, and as soon as she did she resolved to see the empty room for herself.
Hall, still holding the bottle, went first.
"If 'e en't there," he said, "'is close are.
And what's 'e doin' 'ithout 'is close, then?
'Tas a most curious business."
As they came up the cellar steps they both, it was afterwards ascertained, fancied they heard the front door open and shut, but seeing it closed and nothing there, neither said a word to the other about it at the time.
Mrs. Hall passed her husband in the passage and ran on first upstairs.
Someone sneezed on the staircase.
Hall, following six steps behind, thought that he heard her sneeze.
She, going on first, was under the impression that Hall was sneezing.
She flung open the door and stood regarding the room.
"Of all the curious!" she said.
She heard a sniff close behind her head as it seemed, and turning, was surprised to see Hall a dozen feet off on the topmost stair.
But in another moment he was beside her.
She bent forward and put her hand on the pillow and then under the clothes.
"Cold," she said.
"He's been up this hour or more."
As she did so, a most extraordinary thing happened.
The bed-clothes gathered themselves together, leapt up suddenly into a sort of peak, and then jumped headlong over the bottom rail.
It was exactly as if a hand had clutched them in the centre and flung them aside.
Immediately after, the stranger's hat hopped off the bed-post, described a whirling flight in the air through the better part of a circle, and then dashed straight at Mrs. Hall's face.
Then as swiftly came the sponge from the washstand; and then the chair, flinging the stranger's coat and trousers carelessly aside, and laughing drily in a voice singularly like the stranger's, turned itself up with its four legs at Mrs. Hall, seemed to take aim at her for a moment, and charged at her.
She screamed and turned, and then the chair legs came gently but firmly against her back and impelled her and Hall out of the room.
The door slammed violently and was locked.
The chair and bed seemed to be executing a dance of triumph for a moment, and then abruptly everything was still.
Mrs. Hall was left almost in a fainting condition in Mr. Hall's arms on the
landing.
It was with the greatest difficulty that Mr. Hall and Millie, who had been roused by her scream of alarm, succeeded in getting her downstairs, and applying the restoratives customary in such cases. "'Tas sperits," said Mrs. Hall.
"I know 'tas sperits.
I've read in papers of en.
Tables and chairs leaping and dancing..."
"Take a drop more, Janny," said Hall. "'Twill steady ye." "Lock him out," said Mrs. Hall.
"Don't let him come in again.
I half guessed--I might ha' known.
With them goggling eyes and bandaged head, and never going to church of a Sunday.
And all they bottles--more'n it's right for any one to have.
He's put the sperits into the furniture....
My good old furniture!
'Twas in that very chair my poor dear mother used to sit when I was a little girl.
To think it should rise up against me now!"
"Just a drop more, Janny," said Hall.
"Your nerves is all upset."
They sent Millie across the street through the golden five o'clock sunshine to rouse up Mr. Sandy Wadgers, the blacksmith.
Mr. Hall's compliments and the furniture upstairs was behaving most extraordinary.
He was a knowing man, was Mr. Wadgers, and very resourceful.
He took quite a grave view of the case.
"Arm darmed if thet ent witchcraft," was the view of Mr. Sandy Wadgers.
"You warnt horseshoes for such gentry as he."
He came round greatly concerned.
They wanted him to lead the way upstairs to the room, but he didn't seem to be in any hurry.
He preferred to talk in the passage.
Over the way Huxter's apprentice came out and began taking down the shutters of the tobacco window.
He was called over to join the discussion.
Mr. Huxter naturally followed over in the course of a few minutes.
The Anglo-Saxon genius for parliamentary government asserted itself; there was a great deal of talk and no decisive action.
"Let's have the facts first," insisted Mr. Sandy Wadgers.
"Let's be sure we'd be acting perfectly right in bustin' that there door open.
A door onbust is always open to bustin', but ye can't onbust a door once you've busted en."
And suddenly and most wonderfully the door of the room upstairs opened of its own accord, and as they looked up in amazement, they saw descending the stairs the muffled figure of the stranger staring more blackly and blankly than ever with those unreasonably large blue glass eyes of his.
He came down stiffly and slowly, staring all the time; he walked across the passage staring, then stopped.
"Look there!" he said, and their eyes followed the direction of his gloved finger and saw a bottle of sarsaparilla hard by the cellar door.
Then he entered the parlour, and suddenly, swiftly, viciously, slammed the door in their faces.
Not a word was spoken until the last echoes of the slam had died away.
They stared at one another.
"Well, if that don't lick everything!" said
Mr. Wadgers, and left the alternative unsaid.
"I'd go in and ask'n 'bout it," said Wadgers, to Mr. Hall.
"I'd d'mand an explanation." It took some time to bring the landlady's husband up to that pitch.
At last he rapped, opened the door, and got as far as, "Excuse me--"
"Go to the devil!" said the stranger in a tremendous voice, and "Shut that door after you."
So that brief interview terminated.
CHAPTER VII THE UNVElLING OF THE STRANGER
The stranger went into the little parlour of the "Coach and Horses" about half-past five in the morning, and there he remained until near midday, the blinds down, the door shut, and none, after Hall's repulse, venturing near him.
All that time he must have fasted.
Thrice he rang his bell, the third time furiously and continuously, but no one answered him.
"Him and his 'go to the devil' indeed!" said Mrs. Hall.
Presently came an imperfect rumour of the burglary at the vicarage, and two and two were put together.
Hall, assisted by Wadgers, went off to find Mr. Shuckleforth, the magistrate, and take his advice.
No one ventured upstairs.
How the stranger occupied himself is unknown.
Now and then he would stride violently up and down, and twice came an outburst of curses, a tearing of paper, and a violent smashing of bottles.
The little group of scared but curious people increased.
Mrs. Huxter came over; some gay young fellows resplendent in black ready-made jackets and pique paper ties--for it was Whit Monday--joined the group with confused interrogations.
Young Archie Harker distinguished himself by going up the yard and trying to peep under the window-blinds.
He could see nothing, but gave reason for supposing that he did, and others of the
Iping youth presently joined him.
It was the finest of all possible Whit Mondays, and down the village street stood a row of nearly a dozen booths, a shooting gallery, and on the grass by the forge were three yellow and chocolate waggons and some picturesque strangers of both sexes putting up a cocoanut shy.
The gentlemen wore blue jerseys, the ladies white aprons and quite fashionable hats with heavy plumes.
Wodger, of the "Purple Fawn," and Mr. Jaggers, the cobbler, who also sold old second-hand ordinary bicycles, were stretching a string of union-jacks and royal ensigns (which had originally celebrated the first Victorian Jubilee) across the road.
And inside, in the artificial darkness of the parlour, into which only one thin jet of sunlight penetrated, the stranger, hungry we must suppose, and fearful, hidden in his uncomfortable hot wrappings, pored through his dark glasses upon his paper or chinked his dirty little bottles, and occasionally swore savagely at the boys, audible if invisible, outside the windows.
In the corner by the fireplace lay the fragments of half a dozen smashed bottles, and a pungent twang of chlorine tainted the air.
So much we know from what was heard at the time and from what was subsequently seen in the room.
About noon he suddenly opened his parlour door and stood glaring fixedly at the three or four people in the bar.
"Mrs. Hall," he said.
Somebody went sheepishly and called for Mrs. Hall.
Mrs. Hall appeared after an interval, a little short of breath, but all the fiercer for that.
Hall was still out.
She had deliberated over this scene, and she came holding a little tray with an unsettled bill upon it.
"Is it your bill you're wanting, sir?" she said.
"Why wasn't my breakfast laid?
Why haven't you prepared my meals and answered my bell?
Do you think I live without eating?" "Why isn't my bill paid?" said Mrs. Hall.
"That's what I want to know." "I told you three days ago I was awaiting a remittance--"
"I told you two days ago I wasn't going to await no remittances.
You can't grumble if your breakfast waits a bit, if my bill's been waiting these five days, can you?"
The stranger swore briefly but vividly.
"Nar, nar!" from the bar.
"And I'd thank you kindly, sir, if you'd keep your swearing to yourself, sir," said
Mrs. Hall.
The stranger stood looking more like an angry diving-helmet than ever.
It was universally felt in the bar that Mrs. Hall had the better of him.
His next words showed as much.
"Look here, my good woman--" he began.
"Don't 'good woman' me," said Mrs. Hall.
"I've told you my remittance hasn't come." "Remittance indeed!" said Mrs. Hall.
"Still, I daresay in my pocket--"
"You told me three days ago that you hadn't anything but a sovereign's worth of silver upon you." "Well, I've found some more--"
"'Ul-lo!" from the bar.
"I wonder where you found it," said Mrs. Hall.
That seemed to annoy the stranger very much.
He stamped his foot.
"What do you mean?" he said.
"That I wonder where you found it," said
Mrs. Hall.
"And before I take any bills or get any breakfasts, or do any such things whatsoever, you got to tell me one or two things I don't understand, and what nobody don't understand, and what everybody is very anxious to understand.
I want to know what you been doing t'my chair upstairs, and I want to know how 'tis your room was empty, and how you got in again.
Them as stops in this house comes in by the doors--that's the rule of the house, and that you didn't do, and what I want to know is how you did come in.
And I want to know--"
Suddenly the stranger raised his gloved hands clenched, stamped his foot, and said,
"Stop!" with such extraordinary violence that he silenced her instantly.
"You don't understand," he said, "who I am or what I am.
I'll show you.
By Heaven!
I'll show you."
Then he put his open palm over his face and withdrew it.
The centre of his face became a black cavity.
"Here," he said.
He stepped forward and handed Mrs. Hall something which she, staring at his metamorphosed face, accepted automatically.
Then, when she saw what it was, she screamed loudly, dropped it, and staggered back.
The nose--it was the stranger's nose! pink and shining--rolled on the floor.
Then he removed his spectacles, and everyone in the bar gasped.
He took off his hat, and with a violent gesture tore at his whiskers and bandages.
For a moment they resisted him.
A flash of horrible anticipation passed through the bar.
"Oh, my Gard!" said some one.
Then off they came.
It was worse than anything.
Mrs. Hall, standing open-mouthed and horror-struck, shrieked at what she saw, and made for the door of the house.
Everyone began to move.
They were prepared for scars, disfigurements, tangible horrors, but nothing!
The bandages and false hair flew across the passage into the bar, making a hobbledehoy jump to avoid them.
Everyone tumbled on everyone else down the steps.
For the man who stood there shouting some incoherent explanation, was a solid gesticulating figure up to the coat-collar of him, and then--nothingness, no visible thing at all!
People down the village heard shouts and shrieks, and looking up the street saw the
"Coach and Horses" violently firing out its humanity.
They saw Mrs. Hall fall down and Mr. Teddy Henfrey jump to avoid tumbling over her, and then they heard the frightful screams of Millie, who, emerging suddenly from the kitchen at the noise of the tumult, had come upon the headless stranger from behind.
These increased suddenly.
Forthwith everyone all down the street, the sweetstuff seller, cocoanut shy proprietor and his assistant, the swing man, little boys and girls, rustic dandies, smart wenches, smocked elders and aproned gipsies--began running towards the inn, and in a miraculously short space of time a crowd of perhaps forty people, and rapidly increasing, swayed and hooted and inquired and exclaimed and suggested, in front of Mrs. Hall's establishment.
Everyone seemed eager to talk at once, and the result was Babel.
A small group supported Mrs. Hall, who was picked up in a state of collapse.
There was a conference, and the incredible evidence of a vociferous eye-witness.
"O Bogey!"
"What's he been doin', then?" "Ain't hurt the girl, 'as 'e?"
"Run at en with a knife, I believe." "No 'ed, I tell ye.
I don't mean no manner of speaking.
I mean marn 'ithout a 'ed!" "Narnsense! 'tis some conjuring trick." "Fetched off 'is wrapping, 'e did--"
In its struggles to see in through the open door, the crowd formed itself into a straggling wedge, with the more adventurous apex nearest the inn.
"He stood for a moment, I heerd the gal scream, and he turned.
I saw her skirts whisk, and he went after her.
Didn't take ten seconds.
Back he comes with a knife in uz hand and a loaf; stood just as if he was staring.
Not a moment ago.
Went in that there door.
I tell 'e, 'e ain't gart no 'ed at all.
You just missed en--"
There was a disturbance behind, and the speaker stopped to step aside for a little procession that was marching very resolutely towards the house; first Mr.
Hall, very red and determined, then Mr.
Bobby Jaffers, the village constable, and then the wary Mr. Wadgers.
They had come now armed with a warrant.
People shouted conflicting information of the recent circumstances. "'Ed or no 'ed," said Jaffers, "I got to 'rest en, and 'rest en I will."
Mr. Hall marched up the steps, marched straight to the door of the parlour and flung it open.
"Constable," he said, "do your duty." Jaffers marched in.
Hall next, Wadgers last.
They saw in the dim light the headless figure facing them, with a gnawed crust of bread in one gloved hand and a chunk of cheese in the other.
"That's him!" said Hall.
"What the devil's this?" came in a tone of angry expostulation from above the collar of the figure.
"You're a damned rum customer, mister," said Mr. Jaffers.
"But 'ed or no 'ed, the warrant says 'body,' and duty's duty--"
"Keep off!" said the figure, starting back.
Abruptly he whipped down the bread and cheese, and Mr. Hall just grasped the knife on the table in time to save it.
Off came the stranger's left glove and was slapped in Jaffers' face.
In another moment Jaffers, cutting short some statement concerning a warrant, had gripped him by the handless wrist and caught his invisible throat.
He got a sounding kick on the shin that made him shout, but he kept his grip.
Hall sent the knife sliding along the table to Wadgers, who acted as goal-keeper for the offensive, so to speak, and then stepped forward as Jaffers and the stranger swayed and staggered towards him, clutching and hitting in.
A chair stood in the way, and went aside with a crash as they came down together.
"Get the feet," said Jaffers between his teeth.
Mr. Hall, endeavouring to act on instructions, received a sounding kick in the ribs that disposed of him for a moment, and Mr. Wadgers, seeing the decapitated stranger had rolled over and got the upper side of Jaffers, retreated towards the door, knife in hand, and so collided with
Mr. Huxter and the Sidderbridge carter coming to the rescue of law and order.
At the same moment down came three or four bottles from the chiffonnier and shot a web of pungency into the air of the room.
"I'll surrender," cried the stranger, though he had Jaffers down, and in another moment he stood up panting, a strange figure, headless and handless--for he had pulled off his right glove now as well as his left.
"It's no good," he said, as if sobbing for breath.
It was the strangest thing in the world to hear that voice coming as if out of empty space, but the Sussex peasants are perhaps the most matter-of-fact people under the sun.
Jaffers got up also and produced a pair of handcuffs.
Then he stared.
"I say!" said Jaffers, brought up short by a dim realization of the incongruity of the whole business, "Darn it!
Can't use 'em as I can see."
The stranger ran his arm down his waistcoat, and as if by a miracle the buttons to which his empty sleeve pointed became undone.
Then he said something about his shin, and stooped down.
He seemed to be fumbling with his shoes and socks.
"Why!" said Huxter, suddenly, "that's not a man at all.
It's just empty clothes.
Look!
You can see down his collar and the linings of his clothes.
I could put my arm--"
He extended his hand; it seemed to meet something in mid-air, and he drew it back with a sharp exclamation.
"I wish you'd keep your fingers out of my eye," said the aerial voice, in a tone of savage expostulation.
"The fact is, I'm all here--head, hands, legs, and all the rest of it, but it happens I'm invisible.
It's a confounded nuisance, but I am.
That's no reason why I should be poked to pieces by every stupid bumpkin in Iping, is it?"
The suit of clothes, now all unbuttoned and hanging loosely upon its unseen supports, stood up, arms akimbo.
Several other of the men folks had now entered the room, so that it was closely crowded.
"Invisible, eh?" said Huxter, ignoring the stranger's abuse.
"Who ever heard the likes of that?" "It's strange, perhaps, but it's not a crime.
Why am I assaulted by a policeman in this fashion?"
"Ah! that's a different matter," said Jaffers.
"No doubt you are a bit difficult to see in this light, but I got a warrant and it's all correct.
What I'm after ain't no invisibility,--it's burglary.
There's a house been broke into and money took."
"Well?"
"And circumstances certainly point--" "Stuff and nonsense!" said the Invisible
"I hope so, sir; but I've got my instructions."
"Well," said the stranger, "I'll come.
I'll come.
But no handcuffs." "It's the regular thing," said Jaffers.
"No handcuffs," stipulated the stranger.
"Pardon me," said Jaffers.
Abruptly the figure sat down, and before any one could realise was was being done, the slippers, socks, and trousers had been kicked off under the table.
Then he sprang up again and flung off his coat.
"Here, stop that," said Jaffers, suddenly realising what was happening.
He gripped at the waistcoat; it struggled, and the shirt slipped out of it and left it
limply and empty in his hand.
"Hold him!" said Jaffers, loudly.
"Once he gets the things off--"
"Hold him!" cried everyone, and there was a rush at the fluttering white shirt which was now all that was visible of the stranger.
The shirt-sleeve planted a shrewd blow in Hall's face that stopped his open-armed advance, and sent him backward into old Toothsome the sexton, and in another moment the garment was lifted up and became convulsed and vacantly flapping about the arms, even as a shirt that is being thrust over a man's head.
Jaffers clutched at it, and only helped to pull it off; he was struck in the mouth out of the air, and incontinently threw his truncheon and smote Teddy Henfrey savagely upon the crown of his head.
"Look out!" said everybody, fencing at random and hitting at nothing.
"Hold him!
Shut the door!
Don't let him loose!
I got something!
Here he is!"
A perfect Babel of noises they made.
Everybody, it seemed, was being hit all at once, and Sandy Wadgers, knowing as ever and his wits sharpened by a frightful blow in the nose, reopened the door and led the rout.
The others, following incontinently, were jammed for a moment in the corner by the doorway.
The hitting continued.
Phipps, the Unitarian, had a front tooth broken, and Henfrey was injured in the cartilage of his ear.
Jaffers was struck under the jaw, and, turning, caught at something that intervened between him and Huxter in the melee, and prevented their coming together.
He felt a muscular chest, and in another moment the whole mass of struggling, excited men shot out into the crowded hall.
"I got him!" shouted Jaffers, choking and reeling through them all, and wrestling with purple face and swelling veins against his unseen enemy.
Men staggered right and left as the extraordinary conflict swayed swiftly towards the house door, and went spinning down the half-dozen steps of the inn.
Jaffers cried in a strangled voice--holding tight, nevertheless, and making play with his knee--spun around, and fell heavily undermost with his head on the gravel.
Only then did his fingers relax.
There were excited cries of "Hold him!"
"Invisible!" and so forth, and a young fellow, a stranger in the place whose name did not come to light, rushed in at once, caught something, missed his hold, and fell over the constable's prostrate body.
Half-way across the road a woman screamed as something pushed by her; a dog, kicked apparently, yelped and ran howling into Huxter's yard, and with that the transit of the Invisible Man was accomplished.
For a space people stood amazed and gesticulating, and then came panic, and scattered them abroad through the village as a gust scatters dead leaves.
But Jaffers lay quite still, face upward and knees bent, at the foot of the steps of the inn. &gt;
-CHAPTER Vill IN TRANSlT
The eighth chapter is exceedingly brief, and relates that Gibbons, the amateur naturalist of the district, while lying out on the spacious open downs without a soul within a couple of miles of him, as he thought, and almost dozing, heard close to him the sound as of a man coughing, sneezing, and then swearing savagely to himself; and looking, beheld nothing.
Yet the voice was indisputable.
It continued to swear with that breadth and variety that distinguishes the swearing of a cultivated man.
It grew to a climax, diminished again, and died away in the distance, going as it seemed to him in the direction of Adderdean.
It lifted to a spasmodic sneeze and ended.
Gibbons had heard nothing of the morning's occurrences, but the phenomenon was so striking and disturbing that his philosophical tranquillity vanished; he got up hastily, and hurried down the steepness of the hill towards the village, as fast as he could go.
CHAPTER IX MR. THOMAS MARVEL
You must picture Mr. Thomas Marvel as a person of copious, flexible visage, a nose of cylindrical protrusion, a liquorish, ample, fluctuating mouth, and a beard of bristling eccentricity.
His figure inclined to embonpoint; his short limbs accentuated this inclination.
He wore a furry silk hat, and the frequent substitution of twine and shoe-laces for buttons, apparent at critical points of his costume, marked a man essentially bachelor.
Mr. Thomas Marvel was sitting with his feet in a ditch by the roadside over the down towards Adderdean, about a mile and a half out of Iping.
His feet, save for socks of irregular open- work, were bare, his big toes were broad, and pricked like the ears of a watchful dog.
In a leisurely manner--he did everything in a leisurely manner--he was contemplating trying on a pair of boots.
They were the soundest boots he had come across for a long time, but too large for him; whereas the ones he had were, in dry weather, a very comfortable fit, but too thin-soled for damp.
Mr. Thomas Marvel hated roomy shoes, but then he hated damp.
He had never properly thought out which he hated most, and it was a pleasant day, and there was nothing better to do.
So he put the four shoes in a graceful group on the turf and looked at them.
And seeing them there among the grass and springing agrimony, it suddenly occurred to him that both pairs were exceedingly ugly to see.
He was not at all startled by a voice behind him.
"They're boots, anyhow," said the Voice.
"They are--charity boots," said Mr. Thomas Marvel, with his head on one side regarding them distastefully; "and which is the ugliest pair in the whole blessed universe,
I'm darned if I know!"
"H'm," said the Voice.
"I've worn worse--in fact, I've worn none.
But none so owdacious ugly--if you'll allow the expression.
I've been cadging boots--in particular--for days.
Because I was sick of them.
They're sound enough, of course.
But a gentleman on tramp sees such a thundering lot of his boots.
And if you'll believe me, I've raised nothing in the whole blessed country, try as I would, but them.
Look at 'em!
And a good country for boots, too, in a general way.
But it's just my promiscuous luck.
I've got my boots in this country ten years or more.
And then they treat you like this." "It's a beast of a country," said the
Voice.
"And pigs for people." "Ain't it?" said Mr. Thomas Marvel.
"Lord!
But them boots!
It beats it."
He turned his head over his shoulder to the right, to look at the boots of his interlocutor with a view to comparisons, and lo! where the boots of his interlocutor should have been were neither legs nor boots.
He was irradiated by the dawn of a great amazement.
"Where are yer?" said Mr. Thomas Marvel over his shoulder and coming on all fours.
He saw a stretch of empty downs with the wind swaying the remote green-pointed furze bushes.
"Am I drunk?" said Mr. Marvel.
"Have I had visions?
Was I talking to myself?
What the--"
"Don't be alarmed," said a Voice.
"None of your ventriloquising me," said Mr. Thomas Marvel, rising sharply to his feet.
"Where are yer?
Alarmed, indeed!"
"Don't be alarmed," repeated the Voice.
"You'll be alarmed in a minute, you silly fool," said Mr. Thomas Marvel.
"Where are yer?
Lemme get my mark on yer...
"Are yer buried?" said Mr. Thomas Marvel, after an interval.
There was no answer.
Mr. Thomas Marvel stood bootless and amazed, his jacket nearly thrown off.
"Peewit," said a peewit, very remote.
"Peewit, indeed!" said Mr. Thomas Marvel.
"This ain't no time for foolery."
The down was desolate, east and west, north and south; the road with its shallow ditches and white bordering stakes, ran smooth and empty north and south, and, save for that peewit, the blue sky was empty too.
"So help me," said Mr. Thomas Marvel, shuffling his coat on to his shoulders again.
"It's the drink!
I might ha' known."
"It's not the drink," said the Voice.
"You keep your nerves steady."
"Ow!" said Mr. Marvel, and his face grew white amidst its patches.
"It's the drink!" his lips repeated noiselessly.
He remained staring about him, rotating slowly backwards.
"I could have swore I heard a voice," he whispered.
"Of course you did."
"It's there again," said Mr. Marvel, closing his eyes and clasping his hand on his brow with a tragic gesture.
He was suddenly taken by the collar and shaken violently, and left more dazed than ever.
"Don't be a fool," said the Voice.
"I'm--off--my--blooming--chump," said Mr. Marvel.
"It's no good.
It's fretting about them blarsted boots.
I'm off my blessed blooming chump.
Or it's spirits." "Neither one thing nor the other," said the
Voice.
"Listen!"
"Chump," said Mr. Marvel.
"One minute," said the Voice, penetratingly, tremulous with self-control.
"Well?" said Mr. Thomas Marvel, with a strange feeling of having been dug in the chest by a finger.
"You think I'm just imagination?
Just imagination?"
"What else can you be?" said Mr. Thomas Marvel, rubbing the back of his neck.
"Very well," said the Voice, in a tone of relief.
"Then I'm going to throw flints at you till you think differently."
"But where are yer?"
The Voice made no answer.
Whizz came a flint, apparently out of the air, and missed Mr. Marvel's shoulder by a hair's-breadth.
Mr. Marvel, turning, saw a flint jerk up into the air, trace a complicated path, hang for a moment, and then fling at his feet with almost invisible rapidity.
He was too amazed to dodge.
Whizz it came, and ricochetted from a bare toe into the ditch.
Mr. Thomas Marvel jumped a foot and howled aloud.
Then he started to run, tripped over an unseen obstacle, and came head over heels into a sitting position.
"Now," said the Voice, as a third stone curved upward and hung in the air above the tramp.
"Am I imagination?"
Mr. Marvel by way of reply struggled to his feet, and was immediately rolled over again.
He lay quiet for a moment.
"If you struggle any more," said the Voice, "I shall throw the flint at your head."
"It's a fair do," said Mr. Thomas Marvel, sitting up, taking his wounded toe in hand and fixing his eye on the third missile.
"I don't understand it.
Stones flinging themselves.
Stones talking.
Put yourself down.
Rot away.
I'm done." The third flint fell.
"It's very simple," said the Voice.
"I'm an invisible man."
"Tell us something I don't know," said Mr. Marvel, gasping with pain.
"Where you've hid--how you do it--I don't know.
I'm beat."
"That's all," said the Voice.
"I'm invisible.
That's what I want you to understand." "Anyone could see that.
There is no need for you to be so confounded impatient, mister.
Now then.
Give us a notion.
How are you hid?"
"I'm invisible.
That's the great point.
And what I want you to understand is this-- "
"But whereabouts?" interrupted Mr. Marvel.
"Here!
Six yards in front of you."
"Oh, come!
I ain't blind.
You'll be telling me next you're just thin air.
I'm not one of your ignorant tramps--" "Yes, I am--thin air.
You're looking through me."
"What!
Ain't there any stuff to you.
Vox et--what is it?--jabber.
Is it that?"
"I am just a human being--solid, needing food and drink, needing covering too--But
I'm invisible.
You see?
Invisible.
Simple idea.
Invisible."
"What, real like?" "Yes, real."
"Let's have a hand of you," said Marvel, "if you are real.
It won't be so darn out-of-the-way like, then--Lord!" he said, "how you made me jump!--gripping me like that!"
He felt the hand that had closed round his wrist with his disengaged fingers, and his fingers went timorously up the arm, patted a muscular chest, and explored a bearded face.
Marvel's face was astonishment.
"I'm dashed!" he said.
"If this don't beat cock-fighting!
Most remarkable!--And there I can see a rabbit clean through you, 'arf a mile away!
Not a bit of you visible--except--" He scrutinised the apparently empty space keenly.
"You 'aven't been eatin' bread and cheese?" he asked, holding the invisible arm.
"You're quite right, and it's not quite assimilated into the system."
"Ah!" said Mr. Marvel.
"Sort of ghostly, though."
"Of course, all this isn't half so wonderful as you think."
"It's quite wonderful enough for my modest wants," said Mr. Thomas Marvel.
"Howjer manage it!
How the dooce is it done?" "It's too long a story.
And besides--" "I tell you, the whole business fairly beats me," said Mr. Marvel.
"What I want to say at present is this:
I need help.
I have come to that--I came upon you suddenly.
I was wandering, mad with rage, naked, impotent.
I could have murdered.
And I saw you--"
"Lord!" said Mr. Marvel.
"I came up behind you--hesitated--went on-- "
Mr. Marvel's expression was eloquent. "--then stopped.
'Here,' I said, 'is an outcast like myself.
This is the man for me.' So I turned back and came to you--you.
And--" "Lord!" said Mr. Marvel.
"But I'm all in a tizzy.
May I ask--How is it?
And what you may be requiring in the way of help?--Invisible!" "I want you to help me get clothes--and shelter--and then, with other things.
I've left them long enough.
If you won't--well!
But you will--must." "Look here," said Mr. Marvel.
"I'm too flabbergasted.
Don't knock me about any more.
And leave me go.
I must get steady a bit.
And you've pretty near broken my toe.
It's all so unreasonable.
Empty downs, empty sky.
Nothing visible for miles except the bosom of Nature.
And then comes a voice.
A voice out of heaven!
And stones!
And a fist--Lord!"
"Pull yourself together," said the Voice, "for you have to do the job I've chosen for you."
Mr. Marvel blew out his cheeks, and his eyes were round.
"I've chosen you," said the Voice.
"You are the only man except some of those fools down there, who knows there is such a thing as an invisible man.
You have to be my helper.
Help me--and I will do great things for you.
An invisible man is a man of power." He stopped for a moment to sneeze violently.
"But if you betray me," he said, "if you fail to do as I direct you--" He paused and tapped Mr. Marvel's shoulder smartly.
Mr. Marvel gave a yelp of terror at the touch.
"I don't want to betray you," said Mr. Marvel, edging away from the direction of the fingers.
"Don't you go a-thinking that, whatever you do.
All I want to do is to help you--just tell me what I got to do.
(Lord!) Whatever you want done, that I'm most willing to do."
CHAPTER X MR. MARVEL'S VlSIT TO IPlNG
After the first gusty panic had spent itself Iping became argumentative.
Scepticism suddenly reared its head--rather nervous scepticism, not at all assured of its back, but scepticism nevertheless.
It is so much easier not to believe in an invisible man; and those who had actually seen him dissolve into air, or felt the strength of his arm, could be counted on the fingers of two hands.
And of these witnesses Mr. Wadgers was presently missing, having retired impregnably behind the bolts and bars of his own house, and Jaffers was lying stunned in the parlour of the "Coach and Horses."
Great and strange ideas transcending experience often have less effect upon men and women than smaller, more tangible considerations.
Iping was gay with bunting, and everybody was in gala dress.
Whit Monday had been looked forward to for a month or more.
By the afternoon even those who believed in the Unseen were beginning to resume their little amusements in a tentative fashion, on the supposition that he had quite gone away, and with the sceptics he was already a jest.
But people, sceptics and believers alike, were remarkably sociable all that day.
Haysman's meadow was gay with a tent, in which Mrs. Bunting and other ladies were preparing tea, while, without, the Sunday- school children ran races and played games under the noisy guidance of the curate and the Misses Cuss and Sackbut.
No doubt there was a slight uneasiness in the air, but people for the most part had the sense to conceal whatever imaginative qualms they experienced.
On the village green an inclined strong [word missing?], down which, clinging the while to a pulley-swung handle, one could be hurled violently against a sack at the other end, came in for considerable favour among the adolescent, as also did the swings and the cocoanut shies.
There was also promenading, and the steam organ attached to a small roundabout filled the air with a pungent flavour of oil and with equally pungent music.
Members of the club, who had attended church in the morning, were splendid in badges of pink and green, and some of the gayer-minded had also adorned their bowler hats with brilliant-coloured favours of ribbon.
Old Fletcher, whose conceptions of holiday- making were severe, was visible through the jasmine about his window or through the open door (whichever way you chose to look), poised delicately on a plank supported on two chairs, and whitewashing the ceiling of his front room.
About four o'clock a stranger entered the village from the direction of the downs.
He was a short, stout person in an extraordinarily shabby top hat, and he appeared to be very much out of breath.
His cheeks were alternately limp and tightly puffed.
His mottled face was apprehensive, and he moved with a sort of reluctant alacrity.
He turned the corner of the church, and directed his way to the "Coach and Horses."
Among others old Fletcher remembers seeing him, and indeed the old gentleman was so struck by his peculiar agitation that he inadvertently allowed a quantity of whitewash to run down the brush into the sleeve of his coat while regarding him.
This stranger, to the perceptions of the proprietor of the cocoanut shy, appeared to be talking to himself, and Mr. Huxter remarked the same thing.
He stopped at the foot of the "Coach and Horses" steps, and, according to Mr.
Huxter, appeared to undergo a severe internal struggle before he could induce himself to enter the house.
Finally he marched up the steps, and was seen by Mr. Huxter to turn to the left and open the door of the parlour.
Mr. Huxter heard voices from within the room and from the bar apprising the man of his error.
"That room's private!" said Hall, and the stranger shut the door clumsily and went into the bar.
In the course of a few minutes he reappeared, wiping his lips with the back of his hand with an air of quiet satisfaction that somehow impressed Mr.
Huxter as assumed.
He stood looking about him for some moments, and then Mr. Huxter saw him walk in an oddly furtive manner towards the gates of the yard, upon which the parlour window opened.
The stranger, after some hesitation, leant against one of the gate-posts, produced a short clay pipe, and prepared to fill it.
His fingers trembled while doing so.
He lit it clumsily, and folding his arms began to smoke in a languid attitude, an attitude which his occasional glances up the yard altogether belied.
All this Mr. Huxter saw over the canisters of the tobacco window, and the singularity of the man's behaviour prompted him to maintain his observation.
Presently the stranger stood up abruptly and put his pipe in his pocket.
Then he vanished into the yard.
Forthwith Mr. Huxter, conceiving he was witness of some petty larceny, leapt round his counter and ran out into the road to intercept the thief.
As he did so, Mr. Marvel reappeared, his hat askew, a big bundle in a blue table- cloth in one hand, and three books tied together--as it proved afterwards with the
Vicar's braces--in the other.
Directly he saw Huxter he gave a sort of gasp, and turning sharply to the left, began to run.
"Stop, thief!" cried Huxter, and set off after him.
Mr. Huxter's sensations were vivid but brief.
He saw the man just before him and spurting briskly for the church corner and the hill road.
He saw the village flags and festivities beyond, and a face or so turned towards him.
He bawled, "Stop!" again.
He had hardly gone ten strides before his shin was caught in some mysterious fashion, and he was no longer running, but flying with inconceivable rapidity through the air.
He saw the ground suddenly close to his face.
The world seemed to splash into a million whirling specks of light, and subsequent proceedings interested him no more. &gt;
-CHAPTER XI IN THE "COACH AND HORSES"
Now in order clearly to understand what had happened in the inn, it is necessary to go back to the moment when Mr. Marvel first came into view of Mr. Huxter's window.
At that precise moment Mr. Cuss and Mr. Bunting were in the parlour.
They were seriously investigating the strange occurrences of the morning, and were, with Mr. Hall's permission, making a thorough examination of the Invisible Man's belongings.
Jaffers had partially recovered from his fall and had gone home in the charge of his sympathetic friends.
The stranger's scattered garments had been removed by Mrs. Hall and the room tidied up.
And on the table under the window where the stranger had been wont to work, Cuss had hit almost at once on three big books in manuscript labelled "Diary."
"Diary!" said Cuss, putting the three books on the table.
"Now, at any rate, we shall learn something."
The Vicar stood with his hands on the table.
"Diary," repeated Cuss, sitting down, putting two volumes to support the third, and opening it.
"H'm--no name on the fly-leaf.
Bother!--cypher.
And figures." The vicar came round to look over his shoulder.
Cuss turned the pages over with a face suddenly disappointed.
"I'm--dear me!
It's all cypher, Bunting."
"There are no diagrams?" asked Mr. Bunting.
"No illustrations throwing light--" "See for yourself," said Mr. Cuss.
"Some of it's mathematical and some of it's Russian or some such language (to judge by the letters), and some of it's Greek.
Now the Greek I thought you--"
"Of course," said Mr. Bunting, taking out and wiping his spectacles and feeling suddenly very uncomfortable--for he had no Greek left in his mind worth talking about;
"yes--the Greek, of course, may furnish a clue."
"I'll find you a place." "I'd rather glance through the volumes first," said Mr. Bunting, still wiping.
"A general impression first, Cuss, and then, you know, we can go looking for clues."
He coughed, put on his glasses, arranged them fastidiously, coughed again, and wished something would happen to avert the seemingly inevitable exposure.
Then he took the volume Cuss handed him in a leisurely manner.
And then something did happen.
The door opened suddenly.
Both gentlemen started violently, looked round, and were relieved to see a sporadically rosy face beneath a furry silk hat.
"Tap?" asked the face, and stood staring.
"No," said both gentlemen at once.
"Over the other side, my man," said Mr. And "Please shut that door," said Mr. Cuss, irritably.
"All right," said the intruder, as it seemed in a low voice curiously different from the huskiness of its first inquiry.
"Right you are," said the intruder in the former voice.
"Stand clear!" and he vanished and closed the door.
"A sailor, I should judge," said Mr. Bunting.
"Amusing fellows, they are.
Stand clear! indeed.
A nautical term, referring to his getting back out of the room, I suppose." "I daresay so," said Cuss.
"My nerves are all loose to-day.
It quite made me jump--the door opening like that."
"And now," he said with a sigh, "these books."
Someone sniffed as he did so.
"One thing is indisputable," said Bunting, drawing up a chair next to that of Cuss.
"There certainly have been very strange things happen in Iping during the last few days--very strange.
I cannot of course believe in this absurd invisibility story--"
"It's incredible," said Cuss--"incredible.
But the fact remains that I saw--I certainly saw right down his sleeve--" "But did you--are you sure?
Suppose a mirror, for instance-- hallucinations are so easily produced.
I don't know if you have ever seen a really good conjuror--"
"I won't argue again," said Cuss.
"We've thrashed that out, Bunting.
And just now there's these books--Ah! here's some of what I take to be Greek!
Greek letters certainly."
He pointed to the middle of the page.
Mr. Bunting flushed slightly and brought his face nearer, apparently finding some difficulty with his glasses.
Suddenly he became aware of a strange feeling at the nape of his neck.
He tried to raise his head, and encountered an immovable resistance.
The feeling was a curious pressure, the grip of a heavy, firm hand, and it bore his chin irresistibly to the table.
"Don't move, little men," whispered a voice, "or I'll brain you both!"
He looked into the face of Cuss, close to his own, and each saw a horrified reflection of his own sickly astonishment.
"I'm sorry to handle you so roughly," said the Voice, "but it's unavoidable."
"Since when did you learn to pry into an investigator's private memoranda," said the
Voice; and two chins struck the table simultaneously, and two sets of teeth rattled.
"Since when did you learn to invade the private rooms of a man in misfortune?" and the concussion was repeated.
"Where have they put my clothes?"
"Listen," said the Voice.
"The windows are fastened and I've taken the key out of the door.
I am a fairly strong man, and I have the poker handy--besides being invisible.
There's not the slightest doubt that I could kill you both and get away quite easily if I wanted to--do you understand?
Very well.
If I let you go will you promise not to try any nonsense and do what I tell you?"
The vicar and the doctor looked at one another, and the doctor pulled a face.
"Yes," said Mr. Bunting, and the doctor repeated it.
Then the pressure on the necks relaxed, and the doctor and the vicar sat up, both very red in the face and wriggling their heads.
"Please keep sitting where you are," said the Invisible Man.
"Here's the poker, you see."
"When I came into this room," continued the Invisible Man, after presenting the poker to the tip of the nose of each of his visitors, "I did not expect to find it occupied, and I expected to find, in addition to my books of memoranda, an outfit of clothing.
Where is it?
No--don't rise.
I can see it's gone.
Now, just at present, though the days are quite warm enough for an invisible man to run about stark, the evenings are quite chilly.
I want clothing--and other accommodation; and I must also have those three books."
CHAPTER XII THE INVlSIBLE MAN LOSES HlS TEMPER
It is unavoidable that at this point the narrative should break off again, for a certain very painful reason that will presently be apparent.
While these things were going on in the parlour, and while Mr. Huxter was watching
Mr. Marvel smoking his pipe against the gate, not a dozen yards away were Mr. Hall and Teddy Henfrey discussing in a state of cloudy puzzlement the one Iping topic.
Suddenly there came a violent thud against the door of the parlour, a sharp cry, and then--silence.
"Hul-lo!" said Teddy Henfrey.
"Hul-lo!" from the Tap.
Mr. Hall took things in slowly but surely.
"That ain't right," he said, and came round from behind the bar towards the parlour door.
He and Teddy approached the door together, with intent faces.
Their eyes considered.
"Summat wrong," said Hall, and Henfrey nodded agreement.
Whiffs of an unpleasant chemical odour met them, and there was a muffled sound of conversation, very rapid and subdued.
"You all right thur?" asked Hall, rapping.
The muttered conversation ceased abruptly, for a moment silence, then the conversation was resumed, in hissing whispers, then a sharp cry of "No! no, you don't!"
There came a sudden motion and the oversetting of a chair, a brief struggle.
"What the dooce?" exclaimed Henfrey, sotto voce.
"You--all--right thur?" asked Mr. Hall, sharply, again.
The Vicar's voice answered with a curious jerking intonation: "Quite ri-right.
Please don't--interrupt."
"Odd!" said Mr. Henfrey.
"Odd!" said Mr. Hall.
"Says, 'Don't interrupt,'" said Henfrey.
"I heerd'n," said Hall.
"And a sniff," said Henfrey.
They remained listening.
The conversation was rapid and subdued.
"I can't," said Mr. Bunting, his voice rising; "I tell you, sir, I will not."
"What was that?" asked Henfrey.
"Says he wi' nart," said Hall.
"Warn't speaking to us, wuz he?"
"Disgraceful!" said Mr. Bunting, within. "'Disgraceful,'" said Mr. Henfrey.
"I heard it--distinct."
"Who's that speaking now?" asked Henfrey.
"Mr. Cuss, I s'pose," said Hall.
"Can you hear--anything?" Silence.
The sounds within indistinct and perplexing.
"Sounds like throwing the table-cloth about," said Hall.
Mrs. Hall appeared behind the bar.
Hall made gestures of silence and invitation.
This aroused Mrs. Hall's wifely opposition.
"What yer listenin' there for, Hall?" she asked.
"Ain't you nothin' better to do--busy day like this?"
Hall tried to convey everything by grimaces and dumb show, but Mrs. Hall was obdurate.
She raised her voice.
So Hall and Henfrey, rather crestfallen, tiptoed back to the bar, gesticulating to explain to her.
At first she refused to see anything in what they had heard at all.
Then she insisted on Hall keeping silence, while Henfrey told her his story.
She was inclined to think the whole business nonsense--perhaps they were just moving the furniture about.
"I heerd'n say 'disgraceful'; that I did," said Hall.
"I heerd that, Mrs. Hall," said Henfrey.
"Like as not--" began Mrs. Hall.
"Hsh!" said Mr. Teddy Henfrey.
"Didn't I hear the window?" "What window?" asked Mrs. Hall.
"Parlour window," said Henfrey.
Everyone stood listening intently.
Mrs. Hall's eyes, directed straight before her, saw without seeing the brilliant oblong of the inn door, the road white and vivid, and Huxter's shop-front blistering in the June sun.
Abruptly Huxter's door opened and Huxter appeared, eyes staring with excitement, arms gesticulating.
"Yap!" cried Huxter.
"Stop thief!" and he ran obliquely across the oblong towards the yard gates, and vanished.
Simultaneously came a tumult from the parlour, and a sound of windows being closed.
Hall, Henfrey, and the human contents of the tap rushed out at once pell-mell into the street.
They saw someone whisk round the corner towards the road, and Mr. Huxter executing a complicated leap in the air that ended on his face and shoulder.
Down the street people were standing astonished or running towards them.
Mr. Huxter was stunned.
Henfrey stopped to discover this, but Hall and the two labourers from the Tap rushed at once to the corner, shouting incoherent things, and saw Mr. Marvel vanishing by the corner of the church wall.
They appear to have jumped to the impossible conclusion that this was the
Invisible Man suddenly become visible, and set off at once along the lane in pursuit.
But Hall had hardly run a dozen yards before he gave a loud shout of astonishment and went flying headlong sideways, clutching one of the labourers and bringing him to the ground.
He had been charged just as one charges a man at football.
The second labourer came round in a circle, stared, and conceiving that Hall had tumbled over of his own accord, turned to resume the pursuit, only to be tripped by the ankle just as Huxter had been.
Then, as the first labourer struggled to his feet, he was kicked sideways by a blow that might have felled an ox.
As he went down, the rush from the direction of the village green came round the corner.
The first to appear was the proprietor of the cocoanut shy, a burly man in a blue jersey.
He was astonished to see the lane empty save for three men sprawling absurdly on the ground.
And then something happened to his rear- most foot, and he went headlong and rolled sideways just in time to graze the feet of his brother and partner, following headlong.
The two were then kicked, knelt on, fallen over, and cursed by quite a number of over- hasty people.
Now when Hall and Henfrey and the labourers ran out of the house, Mrs. Hall, who had been disciplined by years of experience, remained in the bar next the till.
And suddenly the parlour door was opened, and Mr. Cuss appeared, and without glancing at her rushed at once down the steps toward the corner.
"Hold him!" he cried.
"Don't let him drop that parcel." He knew nothing of the existence of Marvel.
For the Invisible Man had handed over the books and bundle in the yard.
The face of Mr. Cuss was angry and resolute, but his costume was defective, a sort of limp white kilt that could only have passed muster in Greece.
"Hold him!" he bawled.
"He's got my trousers!
And every stitch of the Vicar's clothes!" "'Tend to him in a minute!" he cried to Henfrey as he passed the prostrate Huxter, and, coming round the corner to join the tumult, was promptly knocked off his feet into an indecorous sprawl.
Somebody in full flight trod heavily on his finger.
He yelled, struggled to regain his feet, was knocked against and thrown on all fours again, and became aware that he was involved not in a capture, but a rout.
Everyone was running back to the village.
He rose again and was hit severely behind the ear.
He staggered and set off back to the "Coach and Horses" forthwith, leaping over the deserted Huxter, who was now sitting up, on his way.
Behind him as he was halfway up the inn steps he heard a sudden yell of rage, rising sharply out of the confusion of cries, and a sounding smack in someone's face.
He recognised the voice as that of the Invisible Man, and the note was that of a man suddenly infuriated by a painful blow.
In another moment Mr. Cuss was back in the parlour.
"He's coming back, Bunting!" he said, rushing in.
"Save yourself!"
Mr. Bunting was standing in the window engaged in an attempt to clothe himself in the hearth-rug and a West Surrey Gazette.
"Who's coming?" he said, so startled that his costume narrowly escaped disintegration.
"Invisible Man," said Cuss, and rushed on to the window.
"We'd better clear out from here!
He's fighting mad!
Mad!" In another moment he was out in the yard.
"Good heavens!" said Mr. Bunting, hesitating between two horrible alternatives.
He heard a frightful struggle in the passage of the inn, and his decision was made.
He clambered out of the window, adjusted his costume hastily, and fled up the village as fast as his fat little legs would carry him.
From the moment when the Invisible Man screamed with rage and Mr. Bunting made his memorable flight up the village, it became impossible to give a consecutive account of affairs in Iping.
Possibly the Invisible Man's original intention was simply to cover Marvel's retreat with the clothes and books.
But his temper, at no time very good, seems to have gone completely at some chance blow, and forthwith he set to smiting and overthrowing, for the mere satisfaction of hurting.
You must figure the street full of running figures, of doors slamming and fights for hiding-places.
You must figure the tumult suddenly striking on the unstable equilibrium of old
Fletcher's planks and two chairs--with cataclysmic results.
You must figure an appalled couple caught dismally in a swing.
And then the whole tumultuous rush has passed and the Iping street with its gauds and flags is deserted save for the still raging unseen, and littered with cocoanuts, overthrown canvas screens, and the scattered stock in trade of a sweetstuff stall.
Everywhere there is a sound of closing shutters and shoving bolts, and the only visible humanity is an occasional flitting eye under a raised eyebrow in the corner of a window pane.
The Invisible Man amused himself for a little while by breaking all the windows in the "Coach and Horses," and then he thrust a street lamp through the parlour window of
Mrs. Gribble.
He it must have been who cut the telegraph wire to Adderdean just beyond Higgins' cottage on the Adderdean road.
And after that, as his peculiar qualities allowed, he passed out of human perceptions altogether, and he was neither heard, seen, nor felt in Iping any more.
He vanished absolutely.
But it was the best part of two hours before any human being ventured out again into the desolation of Iping street. &gt;
-CHAPTER Xill MR. MARVEL DlSCUSSES HlS RESlGNATlON
When the dusk was gathering and Iping was just beginning to peep timorously forth again upon the shattered wreckage of its Bank Holiday, a short, thick-set man in a shabby silk hat was marching painfully through the twilight behind the beechwoods on the road to Bramblehurst.
He carried three books bound together by some sort of ornamental elastic ligature, and a bundle wrapped in a blue table-cloth.
His rubicund face expressed consternation and fatigue; he appeared to be in a spasmodic sort of hurry.
He was accompanied by a voice other than his own, and ever and again he winced under the touch of unseen hands.
"If you give me the slip again," said the Voice, "if you attempt to give me the slip again--" "Lord!" said Mr. Marvel.
"That shoulder's a mass of bruises as it is."
"On my honour," said the Voice, "I will kill you."
"I didn't try to give you the slip," said Marvel, in a voice that was not far remote from tears.
"I swear I didn't.
I didn't know the blessed turning, that was all!
How the devil was I to know the blessed turning?
As it is, I've been knocked about--"
"You'll get knocked about a great deal more if you don't mind," said the Voice, and Mr.
Marvel abruptly became silent.
He blew out his cheeks, and his eyes were eloquent of despair.
"It's bad enough to let these floundering yokels explode my little secret, without your cutting off with my books.
It's lucky for some of them they cut and ran when they did!
Here am I ...
No one knew I was invisible!
And now what am I to do?" "What am I to do?" asked Marvel, sotto voce.
"It's all about.
It will be in the papers!
Everybody will be looking for me; everyone on their guard--" The Voice broke off into vivid curses and ceased.
The despair of Mr. Marvel's face deepened, and his pace slackened.
"Go on!" said the Voice.
Mr. Marvel's face assumed a greyish tint between the ruddier patches.
"Don't drop those books, stupid," said the Voice, sharply--overtaking him.
"The fact is," said the Voice, "I shall have to make use of you....
You're a poor tool, but I must."
"I'm a miserable tool," said Marvel.
"You are," said the Voice.
"I'm the worst possible tool you could have," said Marvel.
"I'm not strong," he said after a discouraging silence.
"I'm not over strong," he repeated.
"No?"
"And my heart's weak.
That little business--I pulled it through, of course--but bless you!
I could have dropped." "Well?"
"I haven't the nerve and strength for the sort of thing you want."
"I'll stimulate you." "I wish you wouldn't.
I wouldn't like to mess up your plans, you know.
But I might--out of sheer funk and misery." "You'd better not," said the Voice, with quiet emphasis.
"I wish I was dead," said Marvel.
"It ain't justice," he said; "you must admit....
It seems to me I've a perfect right--"
"Get on!" said the Voice.
Mr. Marvel mended his pace, and for a time they went in silence again.
"It's devilish hard," said Mr. Marvel.
This was quite ineffectual.
He tried another tack.
"What do I make by it?" he began again in a tone of unendurable wrong.
"Oh! shut up!" said the Voice, with sudden amazing vigour.
"I'll see to you all right.
You do what you're told.
You'll do it all right.
You're a fool and all that, but you'll do-- "
"I tell you, sir, I'm not the man for it.
Respectfully--but it is so--" "If you don't shut up I shall twist your wrist again," said the Invisible Man.
"I want to think."
Presently two oblongs of yellow light appeared through the trees, and the square tower of a church loomed through the gloaming.
"I shall keep my hand on your shoulder," said the Voice, "all through the village.
Go straight through and try no foolery.
It will be the worse for you if you do."
"I know that," sighed Mr. Marvel, "I know all that."
The unhappy-looking figure in the obsolete silk hat passed up the street of the little village with his burdens, and vanished into the gathering darkness beyond the lights of the windows.
CHAPTER XlV AT PORT STOWE
Ten o'clock the next morning found Mr. Marvel, unshaven, dirty, and travel- stained, sitting with the books beside him and his hands deep in his pockets, looking very weary, nervous, and uncomfortable, and inflating his cheeks at infrequent intervals, on the bench outside a little inn on the outskirts of Port Stowe.
Beside him were the books, but now they were tied with string.
The bundle had been abandoned in the pine- woods beyond Bramblehurst, in accordance with a change in the plans of the Invisible Man.
Mr. Marvel sat on the bench, and although no one took the slightest notice of him, his agitation remained at fever heat.
His hands would go ever and again to his various pockets with a curious nervous fumbling.
When he had been sitting for the best part of an hour, however, an elderly mariner, carrying a newspaper, came out of the inn and sat down beside him.
"Pleasant day," said the mariner.
Mr. Marvel glanced about him with something very like terror.
"Very," he said.
"Just seasonable weather for the time of year," said the mariner, taking no denial.
"Quite," said Mr. Marvel.
The mariner produced a toothpick, and (saving his regard) was engrossed thereby for some minutes.
His eyes meanwhile were at liberty to examine Mr. Marvel's dusty figure, and the books beside him.
As he had approached Mr. Marvel he had heard a sound like the dropping of coins into a pocket.
He was struck by the contrast of Mr. Marvel's appearance with this suggestion of opulence.
Thence his mind wandered back again to a topic that had taken a curiously firm hold of his imagination.
"Books?" he said suddenly, noisily finishing with the toothpick.
Mr. Marvel started and looked at them.
"Oh, yes," he said.
"Yes, they're books." "There's some extra-ordinary things in books," said the mariner.
"I believe you," said Mr. Marvel.
"And some extra-ordinary things out of
'em," said the mariner.
"True likewise," said Mr. Marvel.
He eyed his interlocutor, and then glanced about him.
"There's some extra-ordinary things in newspapers, for example," said the mariner.
"There are."
"In this newspaper," said the mariner.
"Ah!" said Mr. Marvel.
"There's a story," said the mariner, fixing Mr. Marvel with an eye that was firm and deliberate; "there's a story about an Invisible Man, for instance."
Mr. Marvel pulled his mouth askew and scratched his cheek and felt his ears glowing.
"What will they be writing next?" he asked faintly.
"Ostria, or America?" "Neither," said the mariner.
"Here." "Lord!" said Mr. Marvel, starting.
"When I say here," said the mariner, to Mr. Marvel's intense relief, "I don't of course mean here in this place, I mean hereabouts."
"An Invisible Man!" said Mr. Marvel.
"And what's he been up to?" "Everything," said the mariner, controlling
Marvel with his eye, and then amplifying, "every--blessed--thing."
"I ain't seen a paper these four days," said Marvel.
"Iping's the place he started at," said the mariner.
"In-deed!" said Mr. Marvel.
And where he came from, nobody don't seem to know.
Here it is: 'Pe-culiar Story from Iping.'
And it says in this paper that the evidence is extra-ordinary strong--extra-ordinary."
"Lord!" said Mr. Marvel.
"But then, it's an extra-ordinary story.
There is a clergyman and a medical gent witnesses--saw 'im all right and proper--or leastways didn't see 'im.
He was staying, it says, at the 'Coach an' Horses,' and no one don't seem to have been aware of his misfortune, it says, aware of his misfortune, until in an Altercation in the inn, it says, his bandages on his head was torn off.
It was then ob-served that his head was invisible.
Attempts were At Once made to secure him, but casting off his garments, it says, he succeeded in escaping, but not until after a desperate struggle, in which he had inflicted serious injuries, it says, on our worthy and able constable, Mr. J. A. Jaffers.
Pretty straight story, eh?
Names and everything."
"Lord!" said Mr. Marvel, looking nervously about him, trying to count the money in his pockets by his unaided sense of touch, and full of a strange and novel idea.
"It sounds most astonishing."
"Don't it?
Extra-ordinary, I call it.
Never heard tell of Invisible Men before, I haven't, but nowadays one hears such a lot of extra-ordinary things--that--"
"That all he did?" asked Marvel, trying to seem at his ease.
"It's enough, ain't it?" said the mariner.
"Didn't go Back by any chance?" asked
Marvel.
"Just escaped and that's all, eh?" "All!" said the mariner.
"Why!--ain't it enough?" "Quite enough," said Marvel.
"I should think it was enough," said the mariner.
"I should think it was enough."
"He didn't have any pals--it don't say he had any pals, does it?" asked Mr. Marvel, anxious.
"Ain't one of a sort enough for you?" asked the mariner.
"No, thank Heaven, as one might say, he didn't."
He nodded his head slowly.
"It makes me regular uncomfortable, the bare thought of that chap running about the country!
He is at present At Large, and from certain evidence it is supposed that he has--taken-
-took, I suppose they mean--the road to Port Stowe.
You see we're right in it!
None of your American wonders, this time.
And just think of the things he might do!
Where'd you be, if he took a drop over and above, and had a fancy to go for you?
Suppose he wants to rob--who can prevent him?
He can trespass, he can burgle, he could walk through a cordon of policemen as easy as me or you could give the slip to a blind man!
Easier!
For these here blind chaps hear uncommon sharp, I'm told.
And wherever there was liquor he fancied--" "He's got a tremenjous advantage, certainly," said Mr. Marvel.
"And--well..." "You're right," said the mariner.
"He has."
All this time Mr. Marvel had been glancing about him intently, listening for faint footfalls, trying to detect imperceptible movements.
He seemed on the point of some great resolution.
He coughed behind his hand.
He looked about him again, listened, bent towards the mariner, and lowered his voice:
"The fact of it is--I happen--to know just a thing or two about this Invisible Man.
From private sources."
"Oh!" said the mariner, interested.
"You?"
"Yes," said Mr. Marvel.
"Me."
"Indeed!" said the mariner.
"And may I ask--" "You'll be astonished," said Mr. Marvel behind his hand.
"It's tremenjous."
"Indeed!" said the mariner.
"The fact is," began Mr. Marvel eagerly in a confidential undertone.
Suddenly his expression changed marvellously.
"Ow!" he said.
He rose stiffly in his seat.
His face was eloquent of physical suffering.
"Wow!" he said.
"What's up?" said the mariner, concerned.
"Toothache," said Mr. Marvel, and put his hand to his ear.
He caught hold of his books.
"I must be getting on, I think," he said.
He edged in a curious way along the seat away from his interlocutor.
"But you was just a-going to tell me about this here Invisible Man!" protested the mariner.
Mr. Marvel seemed to consult with himself.
"Hoax," said a Voice.
"It's a hoax," said Mr. Marvel.
"But it's in the paper," said the mariner.
"Hoax all the same," said Marvel.
"I know the chap that started the lie.
There ain't no Invisible Man whatsoever--
Blimey." "But how 'bout this paper?
D'you mean to say--?"
"Not a word of it," said Marvel, stoutly.
The mariner stared, paper in hand.
Mr. Marvel jerkily faced about.
"Wait a bit," said the mariner, rising and speaking slowly, "D'you mean to say--?"
"I do," said Mr. Marvel.
"Then why did you let me go on and tell you all this blarsted stuff, then?
What d'yer mean by letting a man make a fool of himself like that for?
Eh?" Mr. Marvel blew out his cheeks.
The mariner was suddenly very red indeed; he clenched his hands.
"I been talking here this ten minutes," he said; "and you, you little pot-bellied, leathery-faced son of an old boot, couldn't have the elementary manners--"
"Don't you come bandying words with me," said Mr. Marvel.
"Bandying words!
I'm a jolly good mind--"
"Come up," said a Voice, and Mr. Marvel was suddenly whirled about and started marching off in a curious spasmodic manner.
"You'd better move on," said the mariner.
"Who's moving on?" said Mr. Marvel.
He was receding obliquely with a curious hurrying gait, with occasional violent jerks forward.
Some way along the road he began a muttered monologue, protests and recriminations.
"Silly devil!" said the mariner, legs wide apart, elbows akimbo, watching the receding figure.
"I'll show you, you silly ass--hoaxing me!
It's here--on the paper!"
Mr. Marvel retorted incoherently and, receding, was hidden by a bend in the road, but the mariner still stood magnificent in the midst of the way, until the approach of a butcher's cart dislodged him.
Then he turned himself towards Port Stowe.
"Full of extra-ordinary asses," he said softly to himself.
"Just to take me down a bit--that was his silly game--It's on the paper!"
And there was another extraordinary thing he was presently to hear, that had happened quite close to him.
And that was a vision of a "fist full of money" (no less) travelling without visible agency, along by the wall at the corner of St. Michael's Lane.
A brother mariner had seen this wonderful sight that very morning.
He had snatched at the money forthwith and had been knocked headlong, and when he had got to his feet the butterfly money had vanished.
Our mariner was in the mood to believe anything, he declared, but that was a bit too stiff.
Afterwards, however, he began to think things over.
The story of the flying money was true.
And all about that neighbourhood, even from the august London and Country Banking
Company, from the tills of shops and inns-- doors standing that sunny weather entirely open--money had been quietly and dexterously making off that day in handfuls and rouleaux, floating quietly along by walls and shady places, dodging quickly from the approaching eyes of men.
And it had, though no man had traced it, invariably ended its mysterious flight in the pocket of that agitated gentleman in the obsolete silk hat, sitting outside the little inn on the outskirts of Port Stowe.
It was ten days after--and indeed only when the Burdock story was already old--that the mariner collated these facts and began to understand how near he had been to the wonderful Invisible Man. &gt;
-CHAPTER XV THE MAN WHO WAS RUNNlNG
In the early evening time Dr. Kemp was sitting in his study in the belvedere on the hill overlooking Burdock.
It was a pleasant little room, with three windows--north, west, and south--and bookshelves covered with books and scientific publications, and a broad writing-table, and, under the north window, a microscope, glass slips, minute instruments, some cultures, and scattered bottles of reagents.
Dr. Kemp's solar lamp was lit, albeit the sky was still bright with the sunset light, and his blinds were up because there was no offence of peering outsiders to require them pulled down.
Dr. Kemp was a tall and slender young man, with flaxen hair and a moustache almost white, and the work he was upon would earn him, he hoped, the fellowship of the Royal
Society, so highly did he think of it.
And his eye, presently wandering from his work, caught the sunset blazing at the back of the hill that is over against his own.
For a minute perhaps he sat, pen in mouth, admiring the rich golden colour above the crest, and then his attention was attracted by the little figure of a man, inky black, running over the hill-brow towards him.
He was a shortish little man, and he wore a high hat, and he was running so fast that his legs verily twinkled.
"Another of those fools," said Dr. Kemp.
"Like that ass who ran into me this morning round a corner, with the " Visible Man a- coming, sir!' I can't imagine what possess people.
One might think we were in the thirteenth century."
He got up, went to the window, and stared at the dusky hillside, and the dark little figure tearing down it.
"He seems in a confounded hurry," said Dr. Kemp, "but he doesn't seem to be getting on.
If his pockets were full of lead, he couldn't run heavier."
"Spurted, sir," said Dr. Kemp.
In another moment the higher of the villas that had clambered up the hill from Burdock had occulted the running figure.
He was visible again for a moment, and again, and then again, three times between the three detached houses that came next, and then the terrace hid him.
"Asses!" said Dr. Kemp, swinging round on his heel and walking back to his writing- table.
But those who saw the fugitive nearer, and perceived the abject terror on his perspiring face, being themselves in the open roadway, did not share in the doctor's contempt.
By the man pounded, and as he ran he chinked like a well-filled purse that is tossed to and fro.
He looked neither to the right nor the left, but his dilated eyes stared straight downhill to where the lamps were being lit, and the people were crowded in the street.
And his ill-shaped mouth fell apart, and a glairy foam lay on his lips, and his breath came hoarse and noisy.
All he passed stopped and began staring up the road and down, and interrogating one another with an inkling of discomfort for the reason of his haste.
And then presently, far up the hill, a dog playing in the road yelped and ran under a gate, and as they still wondered something- -a wind--a pad, pad, pad,--a sound like a panting breathing, rushed by.
People screamed.
People sprang off the pavement: It passed in shouts, it passed by instinct down the hill.
They were shouting in the street before Marvel was halfway there.
They were bolting into houses and slamming the doors behind them, with the news.
He heard it and made one last desperate spurt.
Fear came striding by, rushed ahead of him, and in a moment had seized the town.
"The Invisible Man is coming!
The Invisible Man!"
CHAPTER XVI IN THE "JOLLY CRlCKETERS"
The "Jolly Cricketers" is just at the bottom of the hill, where the tram-lines begin.
The barman leant his fat red arms on the counter and talked of horses with an anaemic cabman, while a black-bearded man in grey snapped up biscuit and cheese, drank Burton, and conversed in American with a policeman off duty.
"What's the shouting about!" said the anaemic cabman, going off at a tangent, trying to see up the hill over the dirty yellow blind in the low window of the inn.
Somebody ran by outside.
"Fire, perhaps," said the barman.
Footsteps approached, running heavily, the door was pushed open violently, and Marvel, weeping and dishevelled, his hat gone, the neck of his coat torn open, rushed in, made a convulsive turn, and attempted to shut the door.
It was held half open by a strap.
"Coming!" he bawled, his voice shrieking with terror.
"He's coming.
The 'Visible Man!
After me!
For Gawd's sake!
'Elp!
'Elp!
'Elp!"
"Shut the doors," said the policeman.
"Who's coming?
What's the row?"
He went to the door, released the strap, and it slammed.
The American closed the other door.
"Lemme go inside," said Marvel, staggering and weeping, but still clutching the books.
"Lemme go inside.
Lock me in--somewhere.
I tell you he's after me.
I give him the slip.
He said he'd kill me and he will."
"You're safe," said the man with the black beard.
"The door's shut.
What's it all about?"
"Lemme go inside," said Marvel, and shrieked aloud as a blow suddenly made the fastened door shiver and was followed by a hurried rapping and a shouting outside.
"Hullo," cried the policeman, "who's there?"
Mr. Marvel began to make frantic dives at panels that looked like doors.
"He'll kill me--he's got a knife or something.
For Gawd's sake--!" "Here you are," said the barman.
"Come in here."
And he held up the flap of the bar.
Mr. Marvel rushed behind the bar as the summons outside was repeated.
"Don't open the door," he screamed.
"Please don't open the door.
Where shall I hide?" "This, this Invisible Man, then?" asked the man with the black beard, with one hand behind him.
"I guess it's about time we saw him."
The window of the inn was suddenly smashed in, and there was a screaming and running to and fro in the street.
The policeman had been standing on the settee staring out, craning to see who was at the door.
He got down with raised eyebrows.
"It's that," he said.
The barman stood in front of the bar- parlour door which was now locked on Mr.
Marvel, stared at the smashed window, and came round to the two other men.
Everything was suddenly quiet.
"I wish I had my truncheon," said the policeman, going irresolutely to the door.
"Once we open, in he comes.
There's no stopping him."
"Don't you be in too much hurry about that door," said the anaemic cabman, anxiously.
"Draw the bolts," said the man with the black beard, "and if he comes--" He showed a revolver in his hand.
"That won't do," said the policeman; "that's murder."
"I know what country I'm in," said the man with the beard.
"I'm going to let off at his legs.
Draw the bolts." "Not with that blinking thing going off behind me," said the barman, craning over the blind.
"Very well," said the man with the black beard, and stooping down, revolver ready, drew them himself.
Barman, cabman, and policeman faced about.
"Come in," said the bearded man in an undertone, standing back and facing the unbolted doors with his pistol behind him.
No one came in, the door remained closed.
Five minutes afterwards when a second cabman pushed his head in cautiously, they were still waiting, and an anxious face peered out of the bar-parlour and supplied information.
"Are all the doors of the house shut?" asked Marvel.
"He's going round--prowling round.
He's as artful as the devil."
"Good Lord!" said the burly barman.
"There's the back!
Just watch them doors!
I say--!" He looked about him helplessly.
The bar-parlour door slammed and they heard the key turn.
"There's the yard door and the private door.
The yard door--"
He rushed out of the bar.
In a minute he reappeared with a carving- knife in his hand.
"The yard door was open!" he said, and his fat underlip dropped.
"He may be in the house now!" said the first cabman.
"He's not in the kitchen," said the barman.
"There's two women there, and I've stabbed every inch of it with this little beef slicer.
And they don't think he's come in.
They haven't noticed--"
"Have you fastened it?" asked the first cabman.
"I'm out of frocks," said the barman.
The man with the beard replaced his revolver.
And even as he did so the flap of the bar was shut down and the bolt clicked, and then with a tremendous thud the catch of the door snapped and the bar-parlour door burst open.
They heard Marvel squeal like a caught leveret, and forthwith they were clambering over the bar to his rescue.
The bearded man's revolver cracked and the looking-glass at the back of the parlour starred and came smashing and tinkling down.
As the barman entered the room he saw Marvel, curiously crumpled up and struggling against the door that led to the yard and kitchen.
The door flew open while the barman hesitated, and Marvel was dragged into the kitchen.
There was a scream and a clatter of pans.
Marvel, head down, and lugging back obstinately, was forced to the kitchen door, and the bolts were drawn.
Then the policeman, who had been trying to pass the barman, rushed in, followed by one of the cabmen, gripped the wrist of the invisible hand that collared Marvel, was hit in the face and went reeling back.
The door opened, and Marvel made a frantic effort to obtain a lodgment behind it.
Then the cabman collared something.
"I got him," said the cabman.
The barman's red hands came clawing at the unseen.
"Here he is!" said the barman.
Mr. Marvel, released, suddenly dropped to the ground and made an attempt to crawl behind the legs of the fighting men.
The struggle blundered round the edge of the door.
The voice of the Invisible Man was heard for the first time, yelling out sharply, as the policeman trod on his foot.
Then he cried out passionately and his fists flew round like flails.
The cabman suddenly whooped and doubled up, kicked under the diaphragm.
The door into the bar-parlour from the kitchen slammed and covered Mr. Marvel's retreat.
The men in the kitchen found themselves clutching at and struggling with empty air.
"Where's he gone?" cried the man with the beard.
"Out?"
"This way," said the policeman, stepping into the yard and stopping.
A piece of tile whizzed by his head and smashed among the crockery on the kitchen table.
"I'll show him," shouted the man with the black beard, and suddenly a steel barrel shone over the policeman's shoulder, and five bullets had followed one another into the twilight whence the missile had come.
As he fired, the man with the beard moved his hand in a horizontal curve, so that his shots radiated out into the narrow yard like spokes from a wheel.
A silence followed.
"Five cartridges," said the man with the black beard.
"That's the best of all.
Four aces and a joker.
Get a lantern, someone, and come and feel about for his body."
CHAPTER XVII DR. KEMP'S VlSITOR
Dr. Kemp had continued writing in his study until the shots aroused him.
Crack, crack, crack, they came one after the other.
"Hullo!" said Dr. Kemp, putting his pen into his mouth again and listening.
"Who's letting off revolvers in Burdock?
What are the asses at now?"
He went to the south window, threw it up, and leaning out stared down on the network of windows, beaded gas-lamps and shops, with its black interstices of roof and yard that made up the town at night.
"Looks like a crowd down the hill," he said, "by 'The Cricketers,'" and remained watching.
Thence his eyes wandered over the town to far away where the ships' lights shone, and the pier glowed--a little illuminated, facetted pavilion like a gem of yellow
light.
The moon in its first quarter hung over the westward hill, and the stars were clear and almost tropically bright.
After five minutes, during which his mind had travelled into a remote speculation of social conditions of the future, and lost itself at last over the time dimension, Dr.
Kemp roused himself with a sigh, pulled down the window again, and returned to his writing desk.
It must have been about an hour after this that the front-door bell rang.
He had been writing slackly, and with intervals of abstraction, since the shots.
He sat listening.
He heard the servant answer the door, and waited for her feet on the staircase, but she did not come.
"Wonder what that was," said Dr. Kemp.
He tried to resume his work, failed, got up, went downstairs from his study to the
landing, rang, and called over the balustrade to the housemaid as she appeared in the hall below.
"Was that a letter?" he asked.
"Only a runaway ring, sir," she answered.
"I'm restless to-night," he said to himself.
He went back to his study, and this time attacked his work resolutely.
In a little while he was hard at work again, and the only sounds in the room were the ticking of the clock and the subdued shrillness of his quill, hurrying in the very centre of the circle of light his lampshade threw on his table.
It was two o'clock before Dr. Kemp had finished his work for the night.
He rose, yawned, and went downstairs to bed.
He had already removed his coat and vest, when he noticed that he was thirsty.
He took a candle and went down to the dining-room in search of a syphon and whiskey.
Dr. Kemp's scientific pursuits have made him a very observant man, and as he recrossed the hall, he noticed a dark spot on the linoleum near the mat at the foot of the stairs.
He went on upstairs, and then it suddenly occurred to him to ask himself what the spot on the linoleum might be.
Apparently some subconscious element was at work.
At any rate, he turned with his burden, went back to the hall, put down the syphon and whiskey, and bending down, touched the spot.
Without any great surprise he found it had the stickiness and colour of drying blood.
He took up his burden again, and returned upstairs, looking about him and trying to account for the blood-spot.
On the landing he saw something and stopped astonished.
The door-handle of his own room was blood- stained.
He looked at his own hand.
It was quite clean, and then he remembered that the door of his room had been open when he came down from his study, and that consequently he had not touched the handle at all.
He went straight into his room, his face quite calm--perhaps a trifle more resolute than usual.
His glance, wandering inquisitively, fell on the bed.
On the counterpane was a mess of blood, and the sheet had been torn.
He had not noticed this before because he had walked straight to the dressing-table.
On the further side the bedclothes were depressed as if someone had been recently sitting there.
Then he had an odd impression that he had heard a low voice say, "Good Heavens!--
Kemp!" But Dr. Kemp was no believer in voices.
He stood staring at the tumbled sheets.
Was that really a voice?
He looked about again, but noticed nothing further than the disordered and blood- stained bed.
Then he distinctly heard a movement across the room, near the wash-hand stand.
All men, however highly educated, retain some superstitious inklings.
The feeling that is called "eerie" came upon him.
He closed the door of the room, came forward to the dressing-table, and put down his burdens.
Suddenly, with a start, he perceived a coiled and blood-stained bandage of linen rag hanging in mid-air, between him and the wash-hand stand.
He stared at this in amazement.
It was an empty bandage, a bandage properly tied but quite empty.
He would have advanced to grasp it, but a touch arrested him, and a voice speaking quite close to him.
"Kemp!" said the Voice.
"Eh?" said Kemp, with his mouth open.
"Keep your nerve," said the Voice.
"I'm an Invisible Man."
Kemp made no answer for a space, simply stared at the bandage.
"Invisible Man," he said.
"I am an Invisible Man," repeated the
Voice.
The story he had been active to ridicule only that morning rushed through Kemp's brain.
He does not appear to have been either very much frightened or very greatly surprised at the moment.
Realisation came later.
"I thought it was all a lie," he said.
The thought uppermost in his mind was the reiterated arguments of the morning.
"Have you a bandage on?" he asked.
"Yes," said the Invisible Man.
"Oh!" said Kemp, and then roused himself.
"I say!" he said.
"But this is nonsense.
It's some trick."
He stepped forward suddenly, and his hand, extended towards the bandage, met invisible fingers.
He recoiled at the touch and his colour changed.
"Keep steady, Kemp, for God's sake!
I want help badly.
Stop!" The hand gripped his arm.
He struck at it.
"Kemp!" cried the Voice.
"Kemp!
Keep steady!" and the grip tightened. A frantic desire to free himself took possession of Kemp.
The hand of the bandaged arm gripped his shoulder, and he was suddenly tripped and flung backwards upon the bed.
He opened his mouth to shout, and the corner of the sheet was thrust between his teeth.
The Invisible Man had him down grimly, but his arms were free and he struck and tried to kick savagely.
"Listen to reason, will you?" said the Invisible Man, sticking to him in spite of a pounding in the ribs.
"By Heaven! you'll madden me in a minute!
"Lie still, you fool!" bawled the Invisible Man in Kemp's ear.
Kemp struggled for another moment and then lay still.
"If you shout, I'll smash your face," said the Invisible Man, relieving his mouth.
"I'm an Invisible Man.
It's no foolishness, and no magic.
I really am an Invisible Man.
And I want your help.
I don't want to hurt you, but if you behave like a frantic rustic, I must.
Don't you remember me, Kemp?
Griffin, of University College?"
"Let me get up," said Kemp.
"I'll stop where I am.
And let me sit quiet for a minute." He sat up and felt his neck.
"I am Griffin, of University College, and I have made myself invisible.
I am just an ordinary man--a man you have known--made invisible."
"Griffin?" said Kemp.
"Griffin," answered the Voice.
A younger student than you were, almost an albino, six feet high, and broad, with a pink and white face and red eyes, who won the medal for chemistry."
"I am confused," said Kemp.
"My brain is rioting.
What has this to do with Griffin?" "I am Griffin."
Kemp thought.
"It's horrible," he said. "But what devilry must happen to make a man invisible?" "It's no devilry.
It's a process, sane and intelligible enough--"
"It's horrible!" said Kemp.
"How on earth--?"
"It's horrible enough.
But I'm wounded and in pain, and tired ...
Great God!
Kemp, you are a man.
Take it steady.
Give me some food and drink, and let me sit down here."
Kemp stared at the bandage as it moved across the room, then saw a basket chair dragged across the floor and come to rest near the bed.
It creaked, and the seat was depressed the quarter of an inch or so.
He rubbed his eyes and felt his neck again.
"This beats ghosts," he said, and laughed stupidly.
"That's better.
Thank Heaven, you're getting sensible!"
"Or silly," said Kemp, and knuckled his eyes.
"Give me some whiskey.
I'm near dead." "It didn't feel so.
Where are you?
If I get up shall I run into you?
There! all right.
Whiskey?
Here.
Where shall I give it to you?" The chair creaked and Kemp felt the glass drawn away from him.
He let go by an effort; his instinct was all against it.
It came to rest poised twenty inches above the front edge of the seat of the chair.
He stared at it in infinite perplexity.
"This is--this must be--hypnotism.
You have suggested you are invisible."
"Nonsense," said the Voice.
"It's frantic."
"Listen to me."
"I demonstrated conclusively this morning," began Kemp, "that invisibility--"
"Never mind what you've demonstrated!--I'm starving," said the Voice, "and the night is chilly to a man without clothes."
"Food?" said Kemp.
The tumbler of whiskey tilted itself.
"Yes," said the Invisible Man rapping it down.
"Have you a dressing-gown?"
Kemp made some exclamation in an undertone.
He walked to a wardrobe and produced a robe of dingy scarlet.
"This do?" he asked.
It was taken from him.
It hung limp for a moment in mid-air, fluttered weirdly, stood full and decorous buttoning itself, and sat down in his chair.
"Drawers, socks, slippers would be a comfort," said the Unseen, curtly.
"And food." "Anything.
But this is the insanest thing I ever was in, in my life!"
He turned out his drawers for the articles, and then went downstairs to ransack his larder.
He came back with some cold cutlets and bread, pulled up a light table, and placed them before his guest.
"Never mind knives," said his visitor, and a cutlet hung in mid-air, with a sound of gnawing.
"Invisible!" said Kemp, and sat down on a bedroom chair.
"I always like to get something about me before I eat," said the Invisible Man, with a full mouth, eating greedily.
"Queer fancy!"
"I suppose that wrist is all right," said Kemp.
"Trust me," said the Invisible Man.
"Of all the strange and wonderful--"
"Exactly.
But it's odd I should blunder into your house to get my bandaging.
My first stroke of luck!
Anyhow I meant to sleep in this house to- night.
It's a filthy nuisance, my blood showing, isn't it?
Quite a clot over there.
Gets visible as it coagulates, I see.
It's only the living tissue I've changed, and only for as long as I'm alive....
I've been in the house three hours." "But how's it done?" began Kemp, in a tone of exasperation.
"Confound it! The whole business--it's unreasonable from beginning to end." "Quite reasonable," said the Invisible Man.
"Perfectly reasonable."
He reached over and secured the whiskey bottle.
Kemp stared at the devouring dressing gown.
A ray of candle-light penetrating a torn patch in the right shoulder, made a triangle of light under the left ribs.
"What were the shots?" he asked.
"How did the shooting begin?"
"There was a real fool of a man--a sort of confederate of mine--curse him!--who tried to steal my money.
Has done so."
"Is he invisible too?"
"No." "Well?"
"Can't I have some more to eat before I tell you all that?
I'm hungry--in pain.
And you want me to tell stories!" Kemp got up.
"You didn't do any shooting?" he asked.
"Not me," said his visitor.
"Some fool I'd never seen fired at random.
A lot of them got scared.
They all got scared at me.
Curse them!--I say--I want more to eat than this, Kemp."
"I'll see what there is to eat downstairs," said Kemp.
"Not much, I'm afraid."
After he had done eating, and he made a heavy meal, the Invisible Man demanded a cigar.
He bit the end savagely before Kemp could find a knife, and cursed when the outer leaf loosened.
It was strange to see him smoking; his mouth, and throat, pharynx and nares, became visible as a sort of whirling smoke cast.
"This blessed gift of smoking!" he said, and puffed vigorously.
"I'm lucky to have fallen upon you, Kemp.
You must help me.
Fancy tumbling on you just now!
I'm in a devilish scrape--I've been mad, I think.
The things I have been through!
But we will do things yet.
Let me tell you--"
He helped himself to more whiskey and soda.
Kemp got up, looked about him, and fetched a glass from his spare room.
"It's wild--but I suppose I may drink."
"You haven't changed much, Kemp, these dozen years.
You fair men don't.
Cool and methodical--after the first collapse.
I must tell you.
We will work together!"
"But how was it all done?" said Kemp, "and how did you get like this?"
"For God's sake, let me smoke in peace for a little while!
And then I will begin to tell you." But the story was not told that night.
The Invisible Man's wrist was growing painful; he was feverish, exhausted, and his mind came round to brood upon his chase down the hill and the struggle about the inn.
He spoke in fragments of Marvel, he smoked faster, his voice grew angry.
Kemp tried to gather what he could.
"He was afraid of me, I could see that he was afraid of me," said the Invisible Man many times over.
"He meant to give me the slip--he was always casting about!
What a fool I was!
"The cur!
"I should have killed him!" "Where did you get the money?" asked Kemp, abruptly.
The Invisible Man was silent for a space.
"I can't tell you to-night," he said.
He groaned suddenly and leant forward, supporting his invisible head on invisible hands.
"Kemp," he said, "I've had no sleep for near three days, except a couple of dozes of an hour or so.
I must sleep soon."
"Well, have my room--have this room."
"But how can I sleep?
If I sleep--he will get away.
Ugh!
What does it matter?"
"What's the shot wound?" asked Kemp, abruptly.
"Nothing--scratch and blood.
Oh, God!
How I want sleep!"
"Why not?" The Invisible Man appeared to be regarding
Kemp.
"Because I've a particular objection to being caught by my fellow-men," he said slowly.
Kemp started.
"Fool that I am!" said the Invisible Man, striking the table smartly.
"I've put the idea into your head." &gt;
Now, if President Obama invited me to be the next Czar of Mathematics, then I would have a suggestion for him that I think would vastly improve the mathematics education in this country.
And it would be easy to implement and inexpensive.
The mathematics curriculum that we have is based on a foundation of arithmetic and algebra.
And everything we learn after that is building up towards one subject.
And at top of that pyramid, it's calculus.
And I'm here to say that I think that that is the wrong summit of the pyramid ... that the correct summit -- that all of our students, every high school graduate should know -- should be statistics: probability and statistics.
(Applause)
I mean, don't get me wrong.
Calculus is an important subject.
It's one of the great products of the human mind.
The laws of nature are written in the language of calculus.
And every student who studies math, science, engineering, economics, they should definitely learn calculus by the end of their freshman year of college.
But I'm here to say, as a professor of mathematics, that very few people actually use calculus in a conscious, meaningful way, in their day-to-day lives.
On the other hand, statistics -- that's a subject that you could, and should, use on daily basis.
Right?
It's risk. It's reward. It's randomness.
It's understanding data.
I think if our students, if our high school students -- if all of the American citizens -- knew about probability and statistics, we wouldn't be in the economic mess that we're in today. (Laughter) (Applause)
Not only -- thank you -- not only that ... but if it's taught properly, it can be a lot of fun.
I mean, probability and statistics, it's the mathematics of games and gambling.
It's analyzing trends. It's predicting the future.
Look, the world has changed from analog to digital.
And it's time for our mathematics curriculum to change from analog to digital, from the more classical, continuous mathematics, to the more modern, discrete mathematics -- the mathematics of uncertainty, of randomness, of data -- that being probability and statistics.
In summary, instead of our students learning about the techniques of calculus, I think it would be far more significant if all of them knew what two standard deviations from the mean means.
And I mean it.
Thank you very much.
(Applause)

We wanted to say thanks to everyone who was on our cyber count today.
We hope that you enjoy your weekend.
ANGlE BAlLEY:
Good evening, I'm Angie Bailey.
SARAH HlLL:
And I'm Sarah Hill.
Thanks for joining us.
KOMU's Kristin James worked that story on Brian Rankins.
I'm Jake Tapper, I'm the senior White House correspondent for ABC News.
Welcome to this week's inaugural Google+ hang out for a discussion of election year politics.
So Emily, I think you have the next one.
And your question is about the US Supreme Court.
EMlLY:
If the Supreme Court rules that all or a portion of
Obamacare is unconstitutional, are there any positives that President Obama could get out of that decision?
MALE SPEAKER:
I think whatever happens, it's probably not going to be determinative of this election.
I think, though, there's a benefit to President Obama if that happens.
CHRlSTlNA BELLANTONl:
Anybody that has Google+ can use it.
It's sort of the concept of a watch party at home where you'd be watching a speech on your couch except you use it from your laptop.
It was definitely the magic of technology that made it happen.
If you can bring people in to be able to talk about the issues that are driving the day.
BOB SCHlEFFER:
I think this is going to be terrific.

The key question is, "When are we going to get fusion?"
It's really been a long time since we've known about fusion.
We've known about fusion since 1920, when Sir Arthur Stanley Eddington and the British Association for the Advancement of Science conjectured that that's why the sun shines.
I've always been very worried about resource.
I don't know about you, but when my mother gave me food,
I always sorted the ones I disliked from the ones I liked. And I ate the disliked ones first, because the ones you like, you want to save.
And as a child you're always worried about resource.
And once it was sort of explained to me how fast we were using up the world's resources,
I got very upset, about as upset as I did when I realized that the Earth will only last about five billion years before it's swallowed by the sun.
Big events in my life, a strange child.
(Laughter)
Energy, at the moment, is dominated by resource.
The countries that make a lot of money out of energy have something underneath them.
Coal-powered industrial revolution in this country -- oil, gas, sorry.
(Laughter)
Gas, I'm probably the only person who really enjoys it when Mister Putin turns off the gas tap, because my budget goes up.
We're really dominated now by those things that we're using up faster and faster and faster.
And as we try to lift billions of people out of poverty in the Third World, in the developing world, we're using energy faster and faster.
And those resources are going away.
And the way we'll make energy in the future is not from resource, it's really from knowledge.
If you look 50 years into the future, the way we probably will be making energy is probably one of these three, with some wind, with some other things, but these are going to be the base load energy drivers.
Solar can do it, and we certainly have to develop solar.
But we have a lot of knowledge to gain before we can make solar the base load energy supply for the world.
Fission.
Our government is going to put in six new nuclear power stations.
They're going to put in six new nuclear power stations, and probably more after that.
China is building nuclear power stations.
Everybody is.
Because they know that that is one sure way to do carbon-free energy.
But if you wanted to know what the perfect energy source is, the perfect energy source is one that doesn't take up much space, has a virtually inexhaustible supply, is safe, doesn't put any carbon into the atmosphere, doesn't leave any long-lived radioactive waste: it's fusion.
But there is a catch.
Of course there is always a catch in these cases.
Fusion is very hard to do.
We've been trying for 50 years.
Okay.
What is fusion?
Here comes the nuclear physics.
And sorry about that, but this is what turns me on.
(Laughter)
I was a strange child.
Nuclear energy comes for a simple reason.
The most stable nucleus is iron, right in the middle of the periodic table.
It's a medium-sized nucleus.
And you want to go towards iron if you want to get energy.
So, uranium, which is very big, wants to split.
But small atoms want to join together, small nuclei want to join together to make bigger ones to go towards iron.
And you can get energy out this way.
And indeed that's exactly what stars do.
In the middle of stars, you're joining hydrogen together to make helium and then helium together to make carbon, to make oxygen, all the things that you're made of are made in the middle of stars.
But it's a hard process to do because, as you know, the middle of a star is quite hot, almost by definition.
And there is one reaction that's probably the easiest fusion reaction to do.
It's between two isotopes of hydrogen, two kinds of hydrogen: deuterium, which is heavy hydrogen, which you can get from seawater, and tritium which is super-heavy hydrogen.
These two nuclei, when they're far apart, are charged.
And you push them together and they repel.
But when you get them close enough, something called the strong force starts to act and pulls them together.
So, most of the time they repel.
You get them closer and closer and closer and then at some point the strong force grips them together.
For a moment they become helium 5, because they've got five particles inside them.
Deuterium and tritium goes together makes helium 5.
Helium splits out, and a neutron comes out and lots of energy comes out. If you can get something to about 150 million degrees, things will be rattling around so fast that every time they collide in just the right configuration, this will happen, and it will release energy.
And that energy is what powers fusion.
And it's this reaction that we want to do.
There is one trickiness about this reaction.
Well, there is a trickiness that you have to make it 150 million degrees, but there is a trickiness about the reaction yet.
It's pretty hot.
The trickiness about the reaction is that tritium doesn't exist in nature.
You have to make it from something else.
And you make if from lithium.
That reaction at the bottom, that's lithium 6, plus a neutron, will give you more helium, plus tritium.
And that's the way you make your tritium.
But fortunately, if you can do this fusion reaction, you've got a neutron, so you can make that happen.
Now, why the hell would we bother to do this?
This is basically why we would bother to do it.
If you just plot how much fuel we've got left, in units of present world consumption.
And as you go across there you see a few tens of years of oil -- the blue line, by the way, is the lowest estimate of existing resources.
And the yellow line is the most optimistic estimate.
And as you go across there you will see that we've got a few tens of years, and perhaps 100 years of fossil fuels left.
And god knows we don't really want to burn all of it, because it will make an awful lot of carbon in the air.
And then we get to uranium.
And with current reactor technology we really don't have very much uranium.
And we will have to extract uranium from sea water, which is the yellow line, to make conventional nuclear power stations actually do very much for us.
This is a bit shocking, because in fact our government is relying on that for us to meet Kyoto, and do all those kind of things.
To go any further you would have to have breeder technology.
And breeder technology is fast breeders.
And that's pretty dangerous.
The big thing, on the right, is the lithium we have in the world.
And lithium is in sea water.
That's the yellow line.
And we have 30 million years worth of fusion fuel in sea water.
Everybody can get it.
That's why we want to do fusion.
Is it cost-competitive?
We make estimates of what we think it would cost to actually make a fusion power plant.
And we get within about the same price as current electricity.
So, how would we make it?
We have to hold something at 150 million degrees.
And, in fact, we've done this.
We hold it with a magnetic field.
And inside it, right in the middle of this toroidal shape, doughnut shape, right in the middle is 150 million degrees.
It boils away in the middle at 150 million degrees.
And in fact we can make fusion happen.
And just down the road, this is JET.
It's the only machine in the world that's actually done fusion.
When people say fusion is 30 years away, and always will be,
I say, "Yeah, but we've actually done it." Right?
We can do fusion.
In the center of this device we made 16 megawatts of fusion power in 1997.
And in 2013 we're going to fire it up again and break all those records.
But that's not really fusion power.
That's just making some fusion happen.
We've got to take that, we've got to make that into a fusion reactor.
Because we want 30 million years worth of fusion power for the Earth.
This is the device we're building now.
It gets very expensive to do this research.
It turns out you can't do fusion on a table top despite all that cold fusion nonsense.
Right?
You can't.
You have to do it in a very big device.
More than half the world's population is involved in building this device in southern France, which is a nice place to put an experiment.
Seven nations are involved in building this.
It's going to cost us 10 billion.
And we'll produce half a gigawatt of fusion power.
But that's not electricity yet.
We have to get to this.
We have to get to a power plant.
We have to start putting electricity on the grid in this very complex technology.
And I'd really like it to happen a lot faster than it is.
But at the moment, all we can imagine is sometime in the 2030s.
I wish this were different.
We really need it now.
We're going to have a problem with power in the next five years in this country.
So 2030 looks like an infinity away.
But we can't abandon it now; we have to push forward, get fusion to happen.
I wish we had more money, I wish we had more resources.
But this is what we're aiming at, sometime in the 2030s -- real electric power from fusion.
Thank you very much.

I can't concentrate because of you.
It's not the first time you've heard this.
My eardrums are gonna pop!
Doesn't this sound great?
After your military service, I thought you'd grow up.
Anyway, you can't car race.
It's too dangerous.
Hey, Dae-jin.
Look for other work while helping me out like old times.
Your work is just as dangerous.
You always cut your hand.
Over 10,000 people die a year from car accidents.
But I haven't seen anyone die from a car race yet.
Ho-jin.
Step aside.
You worry too much.
I can't die that easily.
Be careful.
Mr. Choi, check the singers' MR tape.
Okay.
Mr. Jun, check the moving lights.
Take a look.
OK!
Mr. Choi, check the monitor speaker.
- Please hurry.
Over here.
- Yes.
Go inside the dome instead of Hyun-woo.
Yes.
It has to be checked properly.
It has to open during the concert.
Why not?
It'll be fun.
Sure.
Getting trapped instead would be fun, huh?
- It won't open!
- Open it up!
I didn't do it.
Don't turn on the master so fast.
Thanks.
Hello?
Yes.
Really?
From the 16th to the 18th?
Yes.
But the exhibition will last for only three days.
Yes.
I'd like it to be for a week though.
Yes.
Then please ask around again.
Thank you.
Bye.
How'd you time it perfectly?
It's pouring.
- Hungry, huh?
- Yes.
This song.
Don't you remember it?
It's my favorite song.
It's nice hearing it in the rain.
Here.
It's a present.
What's with you today?
Thank you.
That's all?
I love you.
What's this?
What's gotten into you today?
You made all this?
Of course.
But it's not my birthday, and yours is much later than mine.
Hey, Eun-soo.
It's our anniversary, dummy.
My goodness, you're right.
I totally forgot.
I'm sorry, Ho-jin.
There's one more thing.
It's the most valuable thing to you, but the chain was always a problem.
Eun-soo, I love you.
Honey.
It's like as if my dad sent you to me.
Why?
Whatever my dad makes, it becomes precious no matter how trifling it is.
Even this necklace, he made it out of peach flower seeds when I was a kid.
I know.
That's why you deserve this much.
There's only one like this in the world, huh?
But I'm sorry I didn't prepare anything.
Then how about I steam you up tonight?
Really?
Tonight?
Sure.
Bastard.
What perfect timing.
He's too big to live with us, huh?
Shall we get him married?
Shall we?
Yeah.
But right after I said it, it really didn't open.
No way.
I must have some telekinetic power.
Do it.
Do what?
Do it.
Okay, I'll give it a try.
Look straight into my eyes.
Yawn.
Should I do it on Dae-jin, too?
Hiccups.
Sorry, I guess I can't.
He did it.
I really had to.
- It switched.
- Stop joking around.
No, it was real.
Don't joke with...
Come on.
No, mine was real, too.
It was real?
Yeah.
I'll go drink some water.
Come here.
No, I have to go drink some water.
Stop joking around.
I'm serious.
Dae-jin, don't you want a girlfriend?
The best times are at your age.
I like it now.
Like what?
Fiddling with your car in the garage?
I'm curious as to what's in that mind of yours.
I'm going to bed so you two drink up.
- Good night.
- You, too.
I'll be in soon.
Dae-jin.
Make sure you block your ears tonight.
- Good night.
- You, too.
I've never seen you neat freak who can't close a lid right.
Thanks a lot for today.
It's nothing.
I'm so happy.
You still have the hiccups?
No, I'm okay.
You still have them.
There's no use tonight.
Let's just go to bed.
It stopped.
It stopped?
It did.
Really?
You're doing it again.
Just go to sleep.
Ho-jin.
Yeah.
You're supposed to put it all the way on.
That's because it's used up.
I'll buy it later.
I think a lot of reporters are coming to my exhibition.
Dae-jin.
Act like a reporter and ask me questions.
So I can practice.
Come on, that's dumb.
Just this once.
Mr. Hwang Ho-jin, please explain your work.
Yes.
From the furniture we commonly see, I felt like I twisted them a little.
Similar to Marcel Duchamp's toilet, I recreated what we commonly see.
Furniture...
Ho-jin.
You practiced a lot, huh?
Does it show?
Of course.
Be a little artsy and inarticulate.
As if it just came to you, and say 'and' a lot.
Also, smiling and lifting your eyes is better.
You're right.
Do it again.
Mr. Hwang Ho-jin, please describe your work.
Yes.
From the furniture... we commonly see...
How can I put it?
I twisted them a little.
That is...
Ho-jin.
Just do it like before.
Bastard.
You did well.
Oh, hi.
What are you doing?
They say pollacks can look far with their big eyes, and can eat a lot with their big mouths.
Then how could they get caught then?
You're right.
If I get hungry while driving, I'm gonna eat it.
Do as you please.
Whether you cook or fry it, I'll put it here for your sake, so be careful.
Thanks, Ho-jin.
Ho-jin.
It's your favorite dish.
Hey.
Is Dae-jin still in the garage?
Wait.
Wait.
What are you doing?
I don't have the hiccups today.
So what?
What if Dae-jin comes?
He's leaving soon.
Wait.
Is it bothering you?
Do something with the table.
Okay, just a sec.
Aren't you going to fast?
I can handle it.
He's taking it too hard from the beginning.
I told him to pace himself and go slow.
Would a drug addict listen if you said to inject slowly?
What's he doing?
I don't know.
Might be engine trouble.
You exhausted the engine.
The race isn't far away, so don't blow the engine.
Don't use too much RPM.
I didn't overdo it.
It'll be fine.
Your record's improving, so I'll let it pass.
But racing isn't all about luck.
Take caution.
I got it.
Hey, the car's in great shape.
Damn it.
I should've been born a car.
Good job everyone.
A coin that brought you pleasure?
Eun-soo.
Huh?
You got another love letter today?
You're so lucky.
For what?
You've been married for three years, but you still exchange love letters?
You're so lucky, Eun-soo.
I wish I could meet a guy like that.
It won't be too easy.
Can't there be a guy like Ho-jin?
What?
Ho-jin.
But the letter's not finished.
That's okay.
- Sleep well?
- Oh, yes.
You must've came in late last night.
Yeah, I had a drink with Yae-joo.
I'm out of lotion, so I came for Ho-jin's.
- It's on the dresser.
- Okay.
That's our business, Dae-jin.
It was just here, but I wasn't looking at it.
If you're done, then please leave.
We live in the same house, but you two are unfair.
So hurry and get married.
Okay.
Ho-jin.
Look at this.
Hello.
Hello.
You're here early, Yae-joo.
Of course.
It's an important day for Dae-jin.
You're the only one who thinks of him.
Ho-jin, this came off.
I'll fix it later.
The more I see it, the prettier it is.
There's only one like this in the world.
I'm so jealous.
- Stay for a while.
- Okay.
You and Dae-jin seem to hit it off.
I wish.
It was better when he took pictures.
I feel like I'm left in the cold now.
He always worries me when he car races.
You should change his mind.
Think he will if I tell him?
Hey, am I invisible now?
- What's up?
- Hey.
Ho-jin, I'm leaving now.
- You're going now?
- Yeah.
Going to the race, right?
Of course.
Tell him good luck for me.
I will.
I'll see you later.
Be careful driving.
See you later.
- Have a nice day.
- Okay.
Oh no.
Drivers please come to the record room for tests.
Five minutes left until the race begins.
Did Ho-jin say he'll come?
Yeah, he did.
He doesn't like me racing, so he might not.
Then why are you if your brother opposes it?
Because I like it.
Drivers please report to the waiting area.
Hey, good luck!
Welcome.
To Yongin Speedway please.
I'm very late.
I have to be there by one.
Wow, you're really late.
I'll go fast.
It's the third Korea Motor Championship.
1st place in the GT Class, Indigo's Kim Yi-soo.
He took pole position in the last match.
3rd place was the wild horse, Bak Joon-woo of Oilbank.
Fourth was Hwang Dae-jin.
Feeling good, huh?
- And don't pass up the in course.
- Okay.
Remember, you're buying tonight.
I know.
Three minutes left until the race.
The gates are closing.
Please clear away from the grid.
The sign board is up.
Start your engines.
I screwed up on corner three.
What's my time?
Present lap time is 1:08:07.
You're doing alright.
Aren't you going too fast?
I thought you were late.
Right.
Don't worry.
I've been accident free for 10 years.
Even as a speed taxi.
It's the 7th head pin, so slow it down.
He wants to kill himself!
He's scaring me!
The steering wheel is strange.
I'm going in.
Hurry up!
What happened?
The steering wheel shakes too much.
Check the tires fast.
Check the tires!
Dae-jin, please be careful.
How much am I behind?
0.3 seconds behind in lap time.
Run the course instead of placing.
No, I have to place.
You still have more to go, so it's okay.
Be careful.
The traffic lights aren't cooperating today.
Dae-jin, there's trouble on the course.
Slow down!
Dae-jin!
What?
What did you say?
I can't hear you well.
His pulse rate and brain waves are improving, but he still can't wake up. It's too bad.
Dr. Lee, what happened to this patient?
Didn't I tell you?
Both brothers got into a car accident.
His older brother got hit by a truck while in a taxi.
So he's pretty much dead.
I guess so.
But the younger one was in a car race accident.
What a strange world.
But is there any hope for this patient?
I don't know.
Are you okay?
Jung-woo, match the steps.
You're falling back.
You're supposed to turn there.
Young-eun!
Are you checking the distance?
They're off.
Mr. Kim, please check the lights.
There are shadows on the models' faces.
Hello?
Oh, hello.
What?
Please rest for now.
It's really fortunate that you at least have come back.
Are you okay?
Get up.
Go rest in your room.
Hey, Dae-jin!
Thanks for being alive.
You were lying there like a corpse, and I was helpless, thinking you'd leave forever.
I'm just really happy that you're alive.
You were a heavy smoker before.
While you were in bed, know how stupid I acted?
I went all the way to the junkyard.
I wanted to see your car get totally demolished.
When I went to see it, I laughed a lot.
You were in bed like that, and I was jealous of that car.
I was acting overboard.
But now
I'm just really thankful that you've come back.
Yae-joo.
Hi, Eun-soo.
Is Dae-jin really alright?
Dae-jin.
What are you doing?
Have a seat.
Did you buy that flower?
No.
I thought you bought it.
Was Dae-jin always a good cook?
The way he cuts vegetables is amazing.
Sit.
Yae-joo, too.
Hurry and eat.
Dae-jin.
Right now, this is all that I can do for you.
Now eat.
Dae-jin.
Dae-jin...
Mr. Hwang Dae-jin.
- After you woke up...
- My name is Hwang Ho-jin.
Any other symptoms besides headaches?
Sometimes my ears ring.
I'm cold. And I keep getting sleepy.
But doctor, I'm Hwang Ho-jin.
What happened to me?
From a psychologist's perspective, his depression and hysteria have sprung up in a peculiar way after his trauma.
On the surface, he believes he's Hwang Ho-jin.
But the problem is that his consciousness firmly believes that he's possessed.
Possessed?
If I explain it simply, the body is taken over by someone else's spirit.
The best way to know is to find proof of his believe from his unconscious.
Doctor.
How can this be possible?
Oh my goodness.
Oh my goodness.
Your hand.
Oh no.
Eun-soo, he cut his hand.
He kept saying he's Ho-jin.
Wait.
My hands aren't listening to me.
I don't know how this happened.
Dae-jin, hurry and go inside first.
Yeah, let's hurry, Dae-jin.
I'm not Dae-jin.
I don't know.
I don't know why I'm like this.
Hey.
Pull yourself together.
You're Hwang Dae-jin.
You're the Hwang Dae-jin.
I've always liked!
Eun-soo, I'm sorry.
I'm really sorry.
Yae-joo.
Dae-jin is still sick.
He's doing this because he's still mentally unstable.
When time passes, he'll be better.
That bastard.
He's trying to suck me dry forever.
I'll be back after I give this to him.
The gift your father gave you.
I've finally fixed it.
- Can you hear my voice?
- Yes.
Tell me your name.
Hwang Ho-jin.
Good.
You're falling into a calmer and deeper sleep.
Imagine a cloud.
A soft wind is blowing.
The cloud is moving slowly.
Very slowly.
Now look slowly below the cloud.
What do you see?
A road.
What's on top of this road?
A taxi.
Taxi.
Are you riding in this taxi?
I don't know.
You're moving forward.
Slowly.
What do you see in front of you?
What do you see?
Calm down.
Put your mind at ease.
Common symptoms for possessed patients are a drop in their temperature and feeling very cold.
They keep sleeping, and even their ears ring.
But doctor how could my husband's soul...
Even modern psychology can't prove whether possession exists or not.
By simply acknowledging it and nursing him is better.
Take your medicine.
How I'm acting now...
I'm not sick, Eun-soo.
I understand.
But you have to take this medicine.
Eun-soo.
Eun-soo, open the door.
Eun-soo, open the door.
I'm not going to do anything.
Eun-soo.
I'm sorry.
I didn't want to do this.
But being alone in that room is too hard for me.
Don't go.
I'm scared, Eun-soo.
If I sleep in that room alone, I feel like I'll never wake up.
I'm very frightened.
Being with Dae-jin is too hard on me.
I feel like I'm unconsciously looking for Ho-jin in him.
No. Honestly, I saw him.
I'm so confused.
I feel like I know what you're going through.
Eun-soo.
I finished my thesis, so I have a lot of time now.
If it's okay that I spend time with him, he'll get better.
When you were in the marines, you said it was hell, but you felt peaceful.
If we work our butt off at my family's ranch, that mildew in your head will wash away.
Yae-joo.
Where can I go?
I'm not going anywhere.
This is my place.
Eun-soo agreed with me.
Eun-soo did?
Yes, your sister-in-law.
If I just stay here like this, everything will turn back to normal.
Hey, how long will you keep this up?
Are you planning to drive us crazy?
Eun-soo is having it hard enough taking care of Ho-jin.
Seeing him in a coma for over a year is hell enough.
What did you just say?
Look.
Look very carefully.
That's Hwang Dae-jin's face.
Know do you get it?
Do you?
If it's that hard on you, I'll become Dae-jin.
I'll live like Dae-jin.
Scared, huh?
Cutting grass, chasing and milking cows.
You'll probably pass out.
But don't worry.
I'll help you.
Ho-jin.
It's Eun-soo.
I see that my Ho-jin is still sleeping.
I thought you hated being lazy.
So how could you sleep this long?
I've changed a lot lately.
I get angry with people a lot, and I don't laugh easily.
If you saw me, you'd be surprised.
I can't remember your voice.
The harder I try, the more I can't remember.
I wish you'd call me just once.
Eun-soo.
Hey, Eun-soo.
Without you, I can't do anything.
Go!
Hey.
You're working up a real sweat.
Trying hard to make my family rich?
Dae-jin.
Leave me alone if you want to make me into Dae-jin.
Since you're not complaining and whining, you're no fun at all.
Fine.
I guess I'll just be a one-woman band forever.
I'll play drums with you sometimes.
Bang, bang.
Hey.
Like you, if I could become someone else, then I wish I had never met you.
Then I could've made about 100 guys like me.
Hey.
Look.
When you do this, you're totally Dae-jin.
Now you laugh for me?
I tried so hard to see it just once.
Hey.
I don't care who you are.
You're simply someone who I love.
Also, I'm going to hold on to that love.
Until I die.
I'm sorry.
I had no choice but to come back.
For Eskimos, when someone they love dies, they gather and talk about that person for five days.
While they talk, they erase their memories of that person.
Afterwards, they never talk about that person again.
If they do, then that person's soul can't rest in peace.
Let's talk about Ho-jin.
About everything you and I know.
Eun-soo.
And then never talk about him again.
After you left to serve, I begged Ho-jin to go over his place.
Stop it, Eun-soo.
It was about the end of June.
It rained the whole day.
When I got there, his place was flooded in.
While we poured water out all day, Ho-jin said, Feels like the world has flooded, and we're the only two left.
To raise money for your tuition, did you know that he worked in a factory for two months?
I was worried so I went to him, and saw him limping while carrying bricks.
I wanted to take him out of there, but I couldn't.
I thought he'd be more upset if he knew I came, so I couldn't.
No one knows.
No one can know.
How we met.
How we loved.
No one knows.
It was exactly on June 28th.
And it started raining from the afternoon.
While pouring out the water, you said, I wish the world swept away, and we were the only two left.
I couldn't bare watching you, and told you to stop, but you silently scooped the water.
A man can never leave a woman, who overcame an obstacle with him.
I worked at the factory for one and a half months.
It was a Saturday.
You suddenly...
You came right before lunch.
After getting yelled at, I turned around, and saw a girl with a yellow shirt walking away.
I also saw you that day.
I wanted to call you, I wanted to grab you,
But I couldn't.
Seeing me like that, I thought make you upset.
I knew how you'd feel, so I couldn't call you.
Stop it.
Eun-soo.
Whenever you laughed or became upset, I was always with you.
So that's why we're the same inside.
Stop it.
Stop.
Look.
Look at me, Eun-soo.
It's me.
Can't you see?
I should've died then, but I couldn't.
I should've died, and be gone forever, but I couldn't.
Because of you.
No one can love you as much as me.
That's why I returned.
Remember this, right?
How could you not?
All the memories that are hidden in our home are proof that we've loved each other until now.
Ho-jin.
Ho-jin.
Eun-soo.
You're all that I have.
Let's buy bananas.
I don't want to.
Why?
I don't like bananas.
But it's for our baby.
You're out of lotion, right?
Should we buy it?
I brought your lunch.
Is it going well?
Yep.
I'm going to have an exhibition.
I feel a lot better now.
That's great.
Don't overwork yourself.
Okay.
What's wrong?
Because you're pretty.
Why do you keep laughing?
Because you're pretty.
It's good to see you a lot happier now.
Does it show?
Yae-joo.
I'm okay.
Anyway, it feels strange.
I tried so hard to bring Dae-jin back, but suddenly, I thought what difference would it make.
Since Dae-jin thought of me only as a friend.
I'm sorry, Yae-joo.
I didn't want to...
But Yae-joo, he's really Ho-jin.
I always felt my father was with me after he died.
Even though I can't see him, it feels the same with Ho-jin.
He's really Ho-jin.
I know.
That Dae-jin isn't someone I can love.
He's someone else now.
And it's not like we can share the same person.
It's a complicated fate.
But I'm glad to see Dae-jin happy before I leave.
You two have to live happily.
Mine and Dae-jin's worth.
I'll go say bye to Dae-jin...
I mean Ho-jin before I leave.
Had it hard because of me, huh?
Because of who?
Dae-jin or Ho-jin?
So you're studying abroad?
Yeah.
When will you come back?
If I do?
Will you become Dae-jin then?
Can I think of you as Dae-jin and say something?
You're a rotten bastard.
Have a good life.
Hey.
Whether you're Dae-jin or Ho-jin, give me a hug.
You really must not be Dae-jin.
Dae-jin never gave me a warm hug like this before.
One sec.
Hello?
Oh, hi.
Yes, it's Hwang Ho-jin.
You remembered.
Yes...
So I'll be ready for the exhibition in about a week I think.
I'd like about two days in advance to set it up.
Yes.
I see.
Wouldn't just one banner out in front be good enough?
Yes.
And for the opening and closing ceremonies, I'd like a sufficient.
It's because of traffic, and I'd like to focus a lot on the opening party.
Yes.
Thank you.
Bye.
To be honest, he's been brain dead for too long.
And some of his body parts are rotten.
I'm sorry to tell you this, but for the patient's sake, I think it's good to send him away.
The latest test results show a lost of corneal reflexes.
Reflexes in the spinal cord have been lost.
Even after the latest test, the patient's brain waves were flat for 30 minutes.
With the test results as proof, we confirm Hwang Ho-jin as brain dead.
Hwang Ho-jin is now deceased.
Yes, I'll see you in a bit.
Okay.
- Please look around.
- Thank you.
Ho-jin, I'll go home and come back tonight.
Why?
Not feeling well?
Your face looks bad.
I just feel a bit dizzy.
Go get some rest then.
Eun-soo.
Why'd you come out?
I wanted to see you leave.
Can you drive?
Of course.
Come here.
I don't want you to leave.
I'll go rest a little and come back.
When you go home... call me.
Okay.
Boy, he scared me.
Go back in.
Go.
Who is it?
I have a package for you.
A package for you.
Please sign here.
Thank you.
I thought you might need the original so I'm returning it.
Even when I'm lying dead in my coffin,
I still won't be able to understand your sick love.
Before then, I hope I forget you.
Wouldn't just one banner out in front be good enough?
Yes.
And for the opening and closing ceremonies,
I'd like a sufficient amount of time.
It's because of traffic, and I'd like to focus a lot on the opening party.
Yes.
Thank you.
Bye.
Like what Marcel Duchamp intended to do with the toilet,
I wanted to make things common to us closer to real life.
So there are a lot of images, like flowers and butterflies.
Eun-soo's Dandelions
I saw a girl today.
She was like the sunshine of September.
The moment I caught all the sadness within me disappeared.
I don't know how to explain this strong feeling.
What are you so nervous about?
No, I'm not.
For someone who's clueless about women,
I'm very curious as to who she is.
I met my brother's woman.
- Sorry I'm late.
- It's okay.
Dae-jin, right?
Dae-jin say hello to Han Eun-soo.
- The world...
- Hi. abandoned me.
Even the skies.
Today is the happiest day of my brother's life.
After today, his life will be even happier.
Since Eun-soo will be with him.
I'm also a happy person.
I'll be able to see Eun-soo forever.
From behind.
Ho-jin told me everything about his times with Eun-soo.
Ho-jin doesn't know women.
So I told him how to write love letters.
And through his letters, Eun-soo became happier.
Ho-jin said he's lucky to have a brother like me.
I'm a luckier guy.
Seeing that I haven't gone insane yet, living under the same roof with them.
To give a pure and fairy-tail like feeling, and to make it pleasurable, was my intention.
Furniture is something that people are very familiar with.
But they easily forget its actual existence.
Dae-jin, don't you want a girlfriend?
The best times are at your age.
I like it now.
Like what?
Fiddling with that car of yours in the garage?
Of course.
Just with that I'm happy enough.
Sometimes I want to just throw it all away, but I can't.
I can't think of anything else, and I don't want to.
I think I'll be like this until I die.
Since it's next to me,
I like it.
I can always see it, and feel it.
I like this a lot.
You're here.
Did everything go well?
So are you okay now?
This piece.
To make this, you stayed up for three days, huh?
Are you really okay?
Yes.
This is the door to heaven.
If I were to explain it, I made it thinking that death isn't a scary thing after all.
Think it gives off a pretty and warm feeling?
Yeah.
And this?
This is Alice in Wonderland.
I made it to be fun and cute, while thinking of our baby.
There's a mirror inside, too.
That'll look better at our doorway.
Sounds good.
Since it's blue, it'll feel fresh.
And we can put the CDs on it.
You haven't seen this, huh?
Yes.
Oh yeah, you saw this while I was working on it.
I saw.
My brother...
My kind brother...
You lived while sacrificing your life for me.
But did you know this?
That I loved Eun-soo first?
I loved her enough to abandon myself.
But Eun-soo never knew.
All she thought of was you.
Yes, my brother.
I'm not in this world anymore.
I'm the one who really died.
I'm going to become you and love Eun-soo now.
Eun-soo will think of you when she's with me, while loving only you.
Ho-jin.
Ho-jin.
You can never forgive me, right?
Don't forgive me.
Never.
Don't ever forgive me.
Ho-jin, I'm sorry.

Money is always a though subject.
It can be complicated, confusing, and a lot of times, very personal.
Filipinos tend to be very shy when it comes to money.
It's a no no to talk about these things with family or friends, and we hardly ever seek professional help.
This is not part of our culture.
So what we love to do in On the Money is clear the clutter and make money come alive.
We actually ask SMEs or subject matter experts from Pryce that is easy to understand and apply.
We need the knowledge so that we can take care of our own financial future, and that's what were're doing here.
We're trying to engage the public, so that they can make better financial decisions.
Sound advice from subject matter experts made easy, free everyday.
That's what you get from On the Money.
Now on its all new season, starting September 9, weekdays 3:30PM only on ANC the ABS-CBN news channel.

CHAPTER XVII The Freeman's Defence
There was a gentle bustle at the Quaker house, as the afternoon drew to a close.
Rachel Halliday moved quietly to and fro, collecting from her household stores such needments as could be arranged in the smallest compass, for the wanderers who were to go forth that night.
The afternoon shadows stretched eastward, and the round red sun stood thoughtfully on the horizon, and his beams shone yellow and calm into the little bed-room where George and his wife were sitting.
He was sitting with his child on his knee, and his wife's hand in his.
Both looked thoughtful and serious and traces of tears were on their cheeks.
"Yes, Eliza," said George, "I know all you say is true.
You are a good child,--a great deal better than I am; and I will try to do as you say.
I'll try to act worthy of a free man.
I'll try to feel like a Christian.
God Almighty knows that I've meant to do well,--tried hard to do well,--when everything has been against me; and now I'll forget all the past, and put away every hard and bitter feeling, and read my Bible, and learn to be a good man."
"And when we get to Canada," said Eliza, "I can help you.
I can do dress-making very well; and I understand fine washing and ironing; and between us we can find something to live on."
"Yes, Eliza, so long as we have each other and our boy.
Eliza, if these people only knew what a blessing it is for a man to feel that his wife and child belong to him!
I've often wondered to see men that could call their wives and children their own fretting and worrying about anything else.
Why, I feel rich and strong, though we have nothing but our bare hands.
I feel as if I could scarcely ask God for any more.
Yes, though I've worked hard every day, till I am twenty-five years old, and have not a cent of money, nor a roof to cover me, nor a spot of land to call my own, yet, if they will only let me alone now, I will be satisfied,--thankful; I will work, and send back the money for you and my boy.
As to my old master, he has been paid five times over for all he ever spent for me.
I don't owe him anything."
"But yet we are not quite out of danger," said Eliza; "we are not yet in Canada."
"True," said George, "but it seems as if I smelt the free air, and it makes me strong."
At this moment, voices were heard in the outer apartment, in earnest conversation, and very soon a rap was heard on the door.
Eliza started and opened it.
Simeon Halliday was there, and with him a Quaker brother, whom he introduced as
Phineas Fletcher.
Phineas was tall and lathy, red-haired, with an expression of great acuteness and shrewdness in his face.
He had not the placid, quiet, unworldly air of Simeon Halliday; on the contrary, a particularly wide-awake and au fait appearance, like a man who rather prides himself on knowing what he is about, and keeping a bright lookout ahead; peculiarities which sorted rather oddly with his broad brim and formal phraseology.
"Our friend Phineas hath discovered something of importance to the interests of thee and thy party, George," said Simeon; "it were well for thee to hear it."
"That I have," said Phineas, "and it shows the use of a man's always sleeping with one ear open, in certain places, as I've always said.
Last night I stopped at a little lone tavern, back on the road.
Thee remembers the place, Simeon, where we sold some apples, last year, to that fat woman, with the great ear-rings.
Well, I was tired with hard driving; and, after my supper I stretched myself down on a pile of bags in the corner, and pulled a buffalo over me, to wait till my bed was ready; and what does I do, but get fast asleep."
"With one ear open, Phineas?" said Simeon, quietly.
"No; I slept, ears and all, for an hour or two, for I was pretty well tired; but when
I came to myself a little, I found that there were some men in the room, sitting round a table, drinking and talking; and I thought, before I made much muster, I'd just see what they were up to, especially as I heard them say something about the Quakers.
'So,' says one, 'they are up in the Quaker settlement, no doubt,' says he.
Then I listened with both ears, and I found that they were talking about this very party.
So I lay and heard them lay off all their plans.
This young man, they said, was to be sent back to Kentucky, to his master, who was going to make an example of him, to keep all niggers from running away; and his wife two of them were going to run down to New
Orleans to sell, on their own account, and they calculated to get sixteen or eighteen hundred dollars for her; and the child, they said, was going to a trader, who had bought him; and then there was the boy,
Jim, and his mother, they were to go back to their masters in Kentucky.
They said that there were two constables, in a town a little piece ahead, who would go in with 'em to get 'em taken up, and the young woman was to be taken before a judge; and one of the fellows, who is small and smooth-spoken, was to swear to her for his property, and get her delivered over to him to take south.
They've got a right notion of the track we are going tonight; and they'll be down after us, six or eight strong.
So now, what's to be done?"
The group that stood in various attitudes, after this communication, were worthy of a painter.
Rachel Halliday, who had taken her hands out of a batch of biscuit, to hear the news, stood with them upraised and floury, and with a face of the deepest concern.
Simeon looked profoundly thoughtful; Eliza had thrown her arms around her husband, and was looking up to him.
George stood with clenched hands and glowing eyes, and looking as any other man might look, whose wife was to be sold at auction, and son sent to a trader, all under the shelter of a Christian nation's laws.
"What shall we do, George?" said Eliza faintly.
"I know what I shall do," said George, as he stepped into the little room, and began examining pistols.
"Ay, ay," said Phineas, nodding his head to Simeon; "thou seest, Simeon, how it will work." "I see," said Simeon, sighing; "I pray it come not to that."
"I don't want to involve any one with or for me," said George.
"If you will lend me your vehicle and direct me, I will drive alone to the next stand.
Jim is a giant in strength, and brave as death and despair, and so am I."
"Ah, well, friend," said Phineas, "but thee'll need a driver, for all that.
Thee's quite welcome to do all the fighting, thee knows; but I know a thing or two about the road, that thee doesn't." "But I don't want to involve you," said
George.
"Involve," said Phineas, with a curious and keen expression of face, "When thee does involve me, please to let me know." "Phineas is a wise and skilful man," said
Simeon.
"Thee does well, George, to abide by his judgment; and," he added, laying his hand kindly on George's shoulder, and pointing to the pistols, "be not over hasty with these,--young blood is hot."
"I will attack no man," said George.
"All I ask of this country is to be let alone, and I will go out peaceably; but,"-- he paused, and his brow darkened and his face worked,--"I've had a sister sold in that New Orleans market.
I know what they are sold for; and am I going to stand by and see them take my wife and sell her, when God has given me a pair of strong arms to defend her?
No; God help me!
I'll fight to the last breath, before they shall take my wife and son.
Can you blame me?" "Mortal man cannot blame thee, George.
Flesh and blood could not do otherwise," said Simeon.
"Woe unto the world because of offences, but woe unto them through whom the offence cometh."
"Would not even you, sir, do the same, in my place?"
"I pray that I be not tried," said Simeon; "the flesh is weak."
"I think my flesh would be pretty tolerable strong, in such a case," said Phineas, stretching out a pair of arms like the sails of a windmill.
"I an't sure, friend George, that I shouldn't hold a fellow for thee, if thee had any accounts to settle with him."
"If man should ever resist evil," said Simeon, "then George should feel free to do it now: but the leaders of our people taught a more excellent way; for the wrath of man worketh not the righteousness of
God; but it goes sorely against the corrupt will of man, and none can receive it save they to whom it is given.
Let us pray the Lord that we be not tempted."
"And so I do," said Phineas; "but if we are tempted too much--why, let them look out, that's all." "It's quite plain thee wasn't born a
Friend," said Simeon, smiling.
"The old nature hath its way in thee pretty strong as yet."
To tell the truth, Phineas had been a hearty, two-fisted backwoodsman, a vigorous hunter, and a dead shot at a buck; but, having wooed a pretty Quakeress, had been moved by the power of her charms to join the society in his neighborhood; and though he was an honest, sober, and efficient member, and nothing particular could be alleged against him, yet the more spiritual among them could not but discern an exceeding lack of savor in his developments.
"Friend Phineas will ever have ways of his own," said Rachel Halliday, smiling; "but we all think that his heart is in the right place, after all."
"Well," said George, "isn't it best that we hasten our flight?"
"I got up at four o'clock, and came on with all speed, full two or three hours ahead of them, if they start at the time they planned.
It isn't safe to start till dark, at any rate; for there are some evil persons in the villages ahead, that might be disposed to meddle with us, if they saw our wagon, and that would delay us more than the waiting; but in two hours I think we may venture.
I will go over to Michael Cross, and engage him to come behind on his swift nag, and keep a bright lookout on the road, and warn us if any company of men come on.
Michael keeps a horse that can soon get ahead of most other horses; and he could shoot ahead and let us know, if there were any danger.
I am going out now to warn Jim and the old woman to be in readiness, and to see about the horse.
We have a pretty fair start, and stand a good chance to get to the stand before they can come up with us.
So, have good courage, friend George; this isn't the first ugly scrape that I've been in with thy people," said Phineas, as he closed the door.
"Phineas is pretty shrewd," said Simeon.
"He will do the best that can be done for thee, George."
"All I am sorry for," said George, "is the risk to you."
"Thee'll much oblige us, friend George, to say no more about that.
What we do we are conscience bound to do; we can do no other way.
And now, mother," said he, turning to Rachel, "hurry thy preparations for these friends, for we must not send them away fasting."
And while Rachel and her children were busy making corn-cake, and cooking ham and chicken, and hurrying on the et ceteras of the evening meal, George and his wife sat in their little room, with their arms folded about each other, in such talk as husband and wife have when they know that a few hours may part them forever.
"Eliza," said George, "people that have friends, and houses, and lands, and money, and all those things can't love as we do, who have nothing but each other.
Till I knew you, Eliza, no creature had loved me, but my poor, heart-broken mother and sister.
I saw poor Emily that morning the trader carried her off.
She came to the corner where I was lying asleep, and said, 'Poor George, your last friend is going.
What will become of you, poor boy?'
And I got up and threw my arms round her, and cried and sobbed, and she cried too; and those were the last kind words I got for ten long years; and my heart all withered up, and felt as dry as ashes, till I met you.
And your loving me,--why, it was almost like raising one from the dead!
I've been a new man ever since!
And now, Eliza, I'll give my last drop of blood, but they shall not take you from me.
Whoever gets you must walk over my dead body."
"O, Lord, have mercy!" said Eliza, sobbing.
"If he will only let us get out of this country together, that is all we ask."
"Is God on their side?" said George, speaking less to his wife than pouring out his own bitter thoughts.
"Does he see all they do?
Why does he let such things happen?
And they tell us that the Bible is on their side; certainly all the power is.
They are rich, and healthy, and happy; they are members of churches, expecting to go to heaven; and they get along so easy in the world, and have it all their own way; and poor, honest, faithful Christians,--
Christians as good or better than they,-- are lying in the very dust under their feet.
They buy 'em and sell 'em, and make trade of their heart's blood, and groans and tears,--and God lets them."
"Friend George," said Simeon, from the kitchen, "listen to this Psalm; it may do thee good."
George drew his seat near the door, and Eliza, wiping her tears, came forward also to listen, while Simeon read as follows:
"But as for me, my feet were almost gone; my steps had well-nigh slipped.
For I was envious of the foolish, when I saw the prosperity of the wicked.
They are not in trouble like other men, neither are they plagued like other men.
Therefore, pride compasseth them as a chain; violence covereth them as a garment.
Their eyes stand out with fatness; they have more than heart could wish.
They are corrupt, and speak wickedly concerning oppression; they speak loftily.
Therefore his people return, and the waters of a full cup are wrung out to them, and they say, How doth God know? and is there knowledge in the Most High?"
"Is not that the way thee feels, George?"
"It is so indeed," said George,--"as well as I could have written it myself."
"Then, hear," said Simeon:
"When I thought to know this, it was too painful for me until I went unto the sanctuary of God.
Then understood I their end.
Surely thou didst set them in slippery places, thou castedst them down to destruction.
As a dream when one awaketh, so, oh Lord, when thou awakest, thou shalt despise their image.
Nevertheless I am continually with thee; thou hast holden me by my right hand.
Thou shalt guide me by thy counsel, and afterwards receive me to glory.
It is good for me to draw near unto God.
I have put my trust in the Lord God." (NOTE: Ps.
The words of holy trust, breathed by the friendly old man, stole like sacred music over the harassed and chafed spirit of George; and after he ceased, he sat with a gentle and subdued expression on his fine features.
"If this world were all, George," said Simeon, "thee might, indeed, ask where is the Lord?
But it is often those who have least of all in this life whom he chooseth for the kingdom.
Put thy trust in him and, no matter what befalls thee here, he will make all right hereafter."
If these words had been spoken by some easy, self-indulgent exhorter, from whose mouth they might have come merely as pious and rhetorical flourish, proper to be used to people in distress, perhaps they might not have had much effect; but coming from one who daily and calmly risked fine and imprisonment for the cause of God and man, they had a weight that could not but be felt, and both the poor, desolate fugitives found calmness and strength breathing into them from it.
And now Rachel took Eliza's hand kindly, and led the way to the supper-table.
As they were sitting down, a light tap sounded at the door, and Ruth entered.
"I just ran in," she said, "with these little stockings for the boy,--three pair, nice, warm woollen ones.
It will be so cold, thee knows, in Canada.
Does thee keep up good courage, Eliza?" she added, tripping round to Eliza's side of the table, and shaking her warmly by the hand, and slipping a seed-cake into Harry's hand.
"I brought a little parcel of these for him," she said, tugging at her pocket to get out the package.
"Children, thee knows, will always be eating."
"O, thank you; you are too kind," said Eliza.
"Come, Ruth, sit down to supper," said Rachel.
"I couldn't, any way.
I left John with the baby, and some biscuits in the oven; and I can't stay a moment, else John will burn up all the biscuits, and give the baby all the sugar in the bowl.
That's the way he does," said the little Quakeress, laughing.
"So, good-by, Eliza; good-by, George; the Lord grant thee a safe journey;" and, with a few tripping steps, Ruth was out of the apartment.
A little while after supper, a large covered-wagon drew up before the door; the night was clear starlight; and Phineas jumped briskly down from his seat to arrange his passengers.
George walked out of the door, with his child on one arm and his wife on the other.
His step was firm, his face settled and resolute.
Rachel and Simeon came out after them.
"You get out, a moment," said Phineas to those inside, "and let me fix the back of the wagon, there, for the women-folks and the boy."
"Here are the two buffaloes," said Rachel.
"Make the seats as comfortable as may be; it's hard riding all night."
Jim came out first, and carefully assisted out his old mother, who clung to his arm, and looked anxiously about, as if she expected the pursuer every moment.
"Jim, are your pistols all in order?" said George, in a low, firm voice.
"And you've no doubt what you shall do, if they come?"
"I rather think I haven't," said Jim, throwing open his broad chest, and taking a deep breath.
"Do you think I'll let them get mother again?"
During this brief colloquy, Eliza had been taking her leave of her kind friend,
Rachel, and was handed into the carriage by Simeon, and, creeping into the back part with her boy, sat down among the buffalo- skins.
The old woman was next handed in and seated and George and Jim placed on a rough board seat front of them, and Phineas mounted in front.
"Farewell, my friends," said Simeon, from without.
"God bless you!" answered all from within.
And the wagon drove off, rattling and jolting over the frozen road.
There was no opportunity for conversation, on account of the roughness of the way and the noise of the wheels.
The vehicle, therefore, rumbled on, through long, dark stretches of woodland,--over wide dreary plains,--up hills, and down valleys,--and on, on, on they jogged, hour after hour.
The child soon fell asleep, and lay heavily in his mother's lap.
The poor, frightened old woman at last forgot her fears; and, even Eliza, as the night waned, found all her anxieties insufficient to keep her eyes from closing.
Phineas seemed, on the whole, the briskest of the company, and beguiled his long drive with whistling certain very unquaker-like songs, as he went on.
But about three o'clock George's ear caught the hasty and decided click of a horse's hoof coming behind them at some distance and jogged Phineas by the elbow.
Phineas pulled up his horses, and listened.
"That must be Michael," he said; "I think I know the sound of his gallop;" and he rose up and stretched his head anxiously back over the road.
A man riding in hot haste was now dimly descried at the top of a distant hill.
"There he is, I do believe!" said Phineas.
George and Jim both sprang out of the wagon before they knew what they were doing.
All stood intensely silent, with their faces turned towards the expected messenger.
On he came.
Now he went down into a valley, where they could not see him; but they heard the sharp, hasty tramp, rising nearer and nearer; at last they saw him emerge on the top of an eminence, within hail.
"Yes, that's Michael!" said Phineas; and, raising his voice, "Halloa, there,
Michael!" "Phineas! is that thee?"
"Yes; what news--they coming?"
"Right on behind, eight or ten of them, hot with brandy, swearing and foaming like so many wolves."
And, just as he spoke, a breeze brought the faint sound of galloping horsemen towards them.
"In with you,--quick, boys, in!" said
Phineas.
"If you must fight, wait till I get you a piece ahead."
And, with the word, both jumped in, and Phineas lashed the horses to a run, the horseman keeping close beside them.
The wagon rattled, jumped, almost flew, over the frozen ground; but plainer, and still plainer, came the noise of pursuing horsemen behind.
The women heard it, and, looking anxiously out, saw, far in the rear, on the brow of a distant hill, a party of men looming up against the red-streaked sky of early dawn.
Another hill, and their pursuers had evidently caught sight of their wagon, whose white cloth-covered top made it conspicuous at some distance, and a loud yell of brutal triumph came forward on the wind.
Eliza sickened, and strained her child closer to her bosom; the old woman prayed and groaned, and George and Jim clenched their pistols with the grasp of despair.
The pursuers gained on them fast; the carriage made a sudden turn, and brought them near a ledge of a steep overhanging rock, that rose in an isolated ridge or clump in a large lot, which was, all around it, quite clear and smooth.
This isolated pile, or range of rocks, rose up black and heavy against the brightening sky, and seemed to promise shelter and concealment.
It was a place well known to Phineas, who had been familiar with the spot in his hunting days; and it was to gain this point he had been racing his horses.
"Now for it!" said he, suddenly checking his horses, and springing from his seat to the ground.
"Out with you, in a twinkling, every one, and up into these rocks with me.
Michael, thee tie thy horse to the wagon, and drive ahead to Amariah's and get him and his boys to come back and talk to these fellows."
In a twinkling they were all out of the carriage.
"There," said Phineas, catching up Harry, "you, each of you, see to the women; and run, now if you ever did run!"
They needed no exhortation.
Quicker than we can say it, the whole party were over the fence, making with all speed for the rocks, while Michael, throwing himself from his horse, and fastening the bridle to the wagon, began driving it rapidly away.
"Come ahead," said Phineas, as they reached the rocks, and saw in the mingled starlight and dawn, the traces of a rude but plainly marked foot-path leading up among them;
"this is one of our old hunting-dens.
Come up!"
Phineas went before, springing up the rocks like a goat, with the boy in his arms.
Jim came second, bearing his trembling old mother over his shoulder, and George and
Eliza brought up the rear.
The party of horsemen came up to the fence, and, with mingled shouts and oaths, were dismounting, to prepare to follow them.
A few moments' scrambling brought them to the top of the ledge; the path then passed between a narrow defile, where only one could walk at a time, till suddenly they came to a rift or chasm more than a yard in breadth, and beyond which lay a pile of rocks, separate from the rest of the ledge, standing full thirty feet high, with its sides steep and perpendicular as those of a castle.
Phineas easily leaped the chasm, and sat down the boy on a smooth, flat platform of crisp white moss, that covered the top of the rock.
"Over with you!" he called; "spring, now, once, for your lives!" said he, as one after another sprang across.
Several fragments of loose stone formed a kind of breast-work, which sheltered their position from the observation of those below.
"Well, here we all are," said Phineas, peeping over the stone breast-work to watch the assailants, who were coming tumultuously up under the rocks.
"Let 'em get us, if they can.
Whoever comes here has to walk single file between those two rocks, in fair range of your pistols, boys, d'ye see?"
"I do see," said George! "and now, as this matter is ours, let us take all the risk, and do all the fighting."
"Thee's quite welcome to do the fighting, George," said Phineas, chewing some checkerberry-leaves as he spoke; "but I may have the fun of looking on, I suppose.
But see, these fellows are kinder debating down there, and looking up, like hens when they are going to fly up on to the roost.
Hadn't thee better give 'em a word of advice, before they come up, just to tell
'em handsomely they'll be shot if they do?"
The party beneath, now more apparent in the light of the dawn, consisted of our old acquaintances, Tom Loker and Marks, with two constables, and a posse consisting of such rowdies at the last tavern as could be engaged by a little brandy to go and help the fun of trapping a set of niggers.
"Well, Tom, yer coons are farly treed," said one.
"Yes, I see 'em go up right here," said Tom; "and here's a path.
I'm for going right up. They can't jump down in a hurry, and it won't take long to ferret 'em out."
"But, Tom, they might fire at us from behind the rocks," said Marks.
"That would be ugly, you know." "Ugh!" said Tom, with a sneer.
"Always for saving your skin, Marks!
No danger! niggers are too plaguy scared!" "I don't know why I shouldn't save my skin," said Marks.
"It's the best I've got; and niggers do fight like the devil, sometimes."
At this moment, George appeared on the top of a rock above them, and, speaking in a calm, clear voice, said, "Gentlemen, who are you, down there, and what do you want?"
"We want a party of runaway niggers," said Tom Loker.
"One George Harris, and Eliza Harris, and their son, and Jim Selden, and an old woman.
We've got the officers, here, and a warrant to take 'em; and we're going to have 'em, too. D'ye hear?
An't you George Harris, that belongs to Mr. Harris, of Shelby county, Kentucky?"
"I am George Harris. A Mr. Harris, of Kentucky, did call me his property.
But now I'm a free man, standing on God's free soil; and my wife and my child I claim as mine.
Jim and his mother are here.
We have arms to defend ourselves, and we mean to do it.
You can come up, if you like; but the first one of you that comes within the range of our bullets is a dead man, and the next, and the next; and so on till the last."
"O, come! come!" said a short, puffy man, stepping forward, and blowing his nose as he did so.
"Young man, this an't no kind of talk at all for you.
You see, we're officers of justice.
We've got the law on our side, and the power, and so forth; so you'd better give up peaceably, you see; for you'll certainly have to give up, at last."
"I know very well that you've got the law on your side, and the power," said George, bitterly.
"You mean to take my wife to sell in New Orleans, and put my boy like a calf in a trader's pen, and send Jim's old mother to the brute that whipped and abused her before, because he couldn't abuse her son.
You want to send Jim and me back to be whipped and tortured, and ground down under the heels of them that you call masters; and your laws will bear you out in it,-- more shame for you and them!
But you haven't got us.
We don't own your laws; we don't own your country; we stand here as free, under God's sky, as you are; and, by the great God that made us, we'll fight for our liberty till we die."
George stood out in fair sight, on the top of the rock, as he made his declaration of independence; the glow of dawn gave a flush to his swarthy cheek, and bitter indignation and despair gave fire to his dark eye; and, as if appealing from man to the justice of God, he raised his hand to heaven as he spoke.
If it had been only a Hungarian youth, now bravely defending in some mountain fastness the retreat of fugitives escaping from Austria into America, this would have been sublime heroism; but as it was a youth of
African descent, defending the retreat of fugitives through America into Canada, of course we are too well instructed and patriotic to see any heroism in it; and if any of our readers do, they must do it on their own private responsibility.
When despairing Hungarian fugitives make their way, against all the search-warrants and authorities of their lawful government, to America, press and political cabinet ring with applause and welcome.
When despairing African fugitives do the same thing,--it is--what is it?
Be it as it may, it is certain that the attitude, eye, voice, manner, of the speaker for a moment struck the party below to silence.
There is something in boldness and determination that for a time hushes even the rudest nature.
Marks was the only one who remained wholly untouched.
He was deliberately cocking his pistol, and, in the momentary silence that followed
George's speech, he fired at him.
"Ye see ye get jist as much for him dead as alive in Kentucky," he said coolly, as he wiped his pistol on his coat-sleeve.
George sprang backward,--Eliza uttered a shriek,--the ball had passed close to his hair, had nearly grazed the cheek of his wife, and struck in the tree above.
"It's nothing, Eliza," said George, quickly.
"Thee'd better keep out of sight, with thy speechifying," said Phineas; "they're mean scamps."
"Now, Jim," said George, "look that your pistols are all right, and watch that pass with me.
The first man that shows himself I fire at; you take the second, and so on.
It won't do, you know, to waste two shots on one."
"But what if you don't hit?" "I shall hit," said George, coolly.
"Good! now, there's stuff in that fellow," muttered Phineas, between his teeth.
The party below, after Marks had fired, stood, for a moment, rather undecided.
"I think you must have hit some on 'em," said one of the men.
"I heard a squeal!" "I'm going right up for one," said Tom.
"I never was afraid of niggers, and I an't going to be now.
Who goes after?" he said, springing up the rocks.
George heard the words distinctly.
He drew up his pistol, examined it, pointed it towards that point in the defile where the first man would appear.
One of the most courageous of the party followed Tom, and, the way being thus made, the whole party began pushing up the rock,- -the hindermost pushing the front ones faster than they would have gone of themselves.
On they came, and in a moment the burly form of Tom appeared in sight, almost at the verge of the chasm.
George fired,--the shot entered his side,-- but, though wounded, he would not retreat, but, with a yell like that of a mad bull, he was leaping right across the chasm into the party.
"Friend," said Phineas, suddenly stepping to the front, and meeting him with a push from his long arms, "thee isn't wanted here."
Down he fell into the chasm, crackling down among trees, bushes, logs, loose stones, till he lay bruised and groaning thirty feet below.
The fall might have killed him, had it not been broken and moderated by his clothes catching in the branches of a large tree; but he came down with some force, however,-
-more than was at all agreeable or convenient.
"Lord help us, they are perfect devils!" said Marks, heading the retreat down the rocks with much more of a will than he had joined the ascent, while all the party came tumbling precipitately after him,--the fat constable, in particular, blowing and puffing in a very energetic manner.
"I say, fellers," said Marks, "you jist go round and pick up Tom, there, while I run and get on to my horse to go back for help,--that's you;" and, without minding the hootings and jeers of his company,
Marks was as good as his word, and was soon seen galloping away.
"Was ever such a sneaking varmint?" said one of the men; "to come on his business, and he clear out and leave us this yer way!"
"Well, we must pick up that feller," said another.
"Cuss me if I much care whether he is dead or alive."
The men, led by the groans of Tom, scrambled and crackled through stumps, logs and bushes, to where that hero lay groaning and swearing with alternate vehemence.
"Ye keep it agoing pretty loud, Tom," said one.
"Ye much hurt?" "Don't know.
Get me up, can't ye?
Blast that infernal Quaker!
If it hadn't been for him, I'd a pitched some on 'em down here, to see how they liked it."
With much labor and groaning, the fallen hero was assisted to rise; and, with one holding him up under each shoulder, they got him as far as the horses.
"If you could only get me a mile back to that ar tavern.
Give me a handkerchief or something, to stuff into this place, and stop this infernal bleeding."
George looked over the rocks, and saw them trying to lift the burly form of Tom into the saddle.
After two or three ineffectual attempts, he reeled, and fell heavily to the ground.
"O, I hope he isn't killed!" said Eliza, who, with all the party, stood watching the proceeding.
"Why not?" said Phineas; "serves him right."
"Because after death comes the judgment," said Eliza.
"Yes," said the old woman, who had been groaning and praying, in her Methodist fashion, during all the encounter, "it's an awful case for the poor crittur's soul."
"On my word, they're leaving him, I do believe," said Phineas.
It was true; for after some appearance of irresolution and consultation, the whole party got on their horses and rode away.
When they were quite out of sight, Phineas began to bestir himself.
"Well, we must go down and walk a piece," he said.
"I told Michael to go forward and bring help, and be along back here with the wagon; but we shall have to walk a piece along the road, I reckon, to meet them.
The Lord grant he be along soon!
It's early in the day; there won't be much travel afoot yet a while; we an't much more than two miles from our stopping-place.
If the road hadn't been so rough last night, we could have outrun 'em entirely."
As the party neared the fence, they discovered in the distance, along the road, their own wagon coming back, accompanied by some men on horseback.
"Well, now, there's Michael, and Stephen and Amariah," exclaimed Phineas, joyfully.
"Now we are made--as safe as if we'd got there."
"Well, do stop, then," said Eliza, "and do something for that poor man; he's groaning dreadfully."
"It would be no more than Christian," said George; "let's take him up and carry him on." "And doctor him up among the Quakers!" said
Phineas; "pretty well, that!
Well, I don't care if we do.
Here, let's have a look at him;" and Phineas, who in the course of his hunting and backwoods life had acquired some rude experience of surgery, kneeled down by the wounded man, and began a careful examination of his condition.
"Marks," said Tom, feebly, "is that you, Marks?"
"No; I reckon 'tan't friend," said Phineas.
"Much Marks cares for thee, if his own skin's safe.
He's off, long ago." "I believe I'm done for," said Tom.
"The cussed sneaking dog, to leave me to die alone!
My poor old mother always told me 't would be so."
"La sakes! jist hear the poor crittur.
He's got a mammy, now," said the old negress.
"I can't help kinder pityin' on him."
"Softly, softly; don't thee snap and snarl, friend," said Phineas, as Tom winced and pushed his hand away.
"Thee has no chance, unless I stop the bleeding."
And Phineas busied himself with making some off-hand surgical arrangements with his own pocket-handkerchief, and such as could be mustered in the company.
"You pushed me down there," said Tom, faintly.
"Well if I hadn't thee would have pushed us down, thee sees," said Phineas, as he stooped to apply his bandage.
"There, there,--let me fix this bandage.
We mean well to thee; we bear no malice.
Thee shall be taken to a house where they'll nurse thee first rate, well as thy own mother could."
Tom groaned, and shut his eyes.
In men of his class, vigor and resolution are entirely a physical matter, and ooze out with the flowing of the blood; and the gigantic fellow really looked piteous in his helplessness.
The other party now came up.
The seats were taken out of the wagon.
The buffalo-skins, doubled in fours, were spread all along one side, and four men, with great difficulty, lifted the heavy form of Tom into it.
Before he was gotten in, he fainted entirely.
The old negress, in the abundance of her compassion, sat down on the bottom, and took his head in her lap.
Eliza, George and Jim, bestowed themselves, as well as they could, in the remaining space and the whole party set forward.
"What do you think of him?" said George, who sat by Phineas in front.
"Well it's only a pretty deep flesh-wound; but, then, tumbling and scratching down that place didn't help him much.
It has bled pretty freely,--pretty much drained him out, courage and all,--but he'll get over it, and may be learn a thing or two by it."
"I'm glad to hear you say so," said George.
"It would always be a heavy thought to me, if I'd caused his death, even in a just cause."
"Yes," said Phineas, "killing is an ugly operation, any way they'll fix it,--man or beast.
I've seen a buck that was shot down and a dying, look that way on a feller with his eye, that it reely most made a feller feel wicked for killing on him; and human creatures is a more serious consideration yet, bein', as thy wife says, that the judgment comes to 'em after death.
So I don't know as our people's notions on these matters is too strict; and, considerin' how I was raised, I fell in with them pretty considerably."
"What shall you do with this poor fellow?" said George.
"O, carry him along to Amariah's.
There's old Grandmam Stephens there,-- Dorcas, they call her,--she's most an amazin' nurse.
She takes to nursing real natural, and an't never better suited than when she gets a sick body to tend.
We may reckon on turning him over to her for a fortnight or so."
A ride of about an hour more brought the party to a neat farmhouse, where the weary travellers were received to an abundant breakfast.
Tom Loker was soon carefully deposited in a much cleaner and softer bed than he had ever been in the habit of occupying.
His wound was carefully dressed and bandaged, and he lay languidly opening and shutting his eyes on the white window- curtains and gently-gliding figures of his sick room, like a weary child.
And here, for the present, we shall take our leave of one party.

I love the Internet.
It's true.
Think about everything it has brought us.
Think about all the services we use, all the connectivity, all the entertainment, all the business, all the commerce.
And it's happening during our lifetimes.
I'm pretty sure that one day we'll be writing history books hundreds of years from now.
This time our generation will be remembered as the generation that got online, the generation that built something really and truly global.
But yes, it's also true that the Internet has problems, very serious problems, problems with security and problems with privacy.
I've spent my career fighting these problems.
So let me show you something.
This here is Brain.
This is a floppy disk
-- five and a quarter-inch floppy disk infected by Brain.A.
It's the first virus we ever found for PC computers.
And we actually know where Brain came from.
We know because it says so inside the code.
Let's take a look.
All right.
That's the boot sector of an infected floppy, and if we take a closer look inside, we'll see that right there, it says, "Welcome to the dungeon."
And then it continues, saying, 1986, Basit and Amjad.
And Basit and Amjad are first names,
Pakistani first names.
In fact, there's a phone number and an address in Pakistan.
(Laughter)
Now, 1986.
Now it's 2011.
That's 25 years ago.
The PC virus problem is 25 years old now.
So half a year ago,
I decided to go to Pakistan myself.
So let's see, here's a couple of photos I took while I was in Pakistan.
This is from the city of Lahore, which is around 300 kilometers south from Abbottabad, where Bin Laden was caught.
Here's a typical street view.
And here's the street or road leading to this building, which is 730 Nizam block at Allama Iqbal Town.
And I knocked on the door.
(Laughter)
You want to guess who opened the door?
Basit and Amjad; they are still there.
(Laughter) (Applause)
So here standing up is Basit.
Sitting down is his brother Amjad.
These are the guys who wrote the first PC virus.
Now of course, we had a very interesting discussion.
I asked them why.
I asked them how they feel about what they started.
And I got some sort of satisfaction from learning that both Basit and Amjad had had their computers infected dozens of times by completely unrelated other viruses over these years.
So there is some sort of justice in the world after all.
Now, the viruses that we used to see in the 1980s and 1990s obviously are not a problem any more.
So let me just show you a couple of examples of what they used to look like.
What I'm running here is a system that enables me to run age-old programs on a modern computer.
So let me just mount some drives.
Go over there.
What we have here is a list of old viruses.
So let me just run some viruses on my computer.
For example, let's go with the Centipede virus first.
And you can see at the top of the screen, there's a centipede scrolling across your computer when you get infected by this one.
You know that you're infected because it actually shows up.
Here's another one.
This is the virus called Crash, invented in Russia in 1992.
Let me show you one which actually makes some sound.
(Siren noise)
And the last example, guess what the Walker virus does?
Yes, there's a guy walking across your screen once you get infected.
So it used to be fairly easy to know that you're infected by a virus, when the viruses were written by hobbyists and teenagers.
Today, they are no longer being written by hobbyists and teenagers.
Today, viruses are a global problem.
What we have here in the background is an example of our systems that we run in our labs, where we track virus infections worldwide.
So we can actually see in real time that we've just blocked viruses in Sweden and Taiwan and Russia and elsewhere.
In fact, if I just connect back to our lab systems through the Web, we can see in real time just some kind of idea of how many viruses, how many new examples of malware we find every single day.
Here's the latest virus we've found, in a file called Server.exe.
And we found it right over here three seconds ago -- the previous one, six seconds ago.
And if we just scroll around, it's just massive.
We find tens of thousands, even hundreds of thousands.
And that's the last 20 minutes of malware every single day.
So where are all these coming from then?
Well today, it's the organized criminal gangs writing these viruses because they make money with their viruses.
It's gangs like -- let's go to GangstaBucks.com.
This is a website operating in Moscow where these guys are buying infected computers.
So if you are a virus writer and you're capable of infecting Windows computers, but you don't know what to do with them, you can sell those infected computers -- somebody else's computers -- to these guys.
And they'll actually pay you money for those computers.
So how do these guys then monetize those infected computers?
Well there's multiple different ways, such as banking trojans, which will steal money from your online banking accounts when you do online banking, or keyloggers.
Keyloggers silently sit on your computer, hidden from view, and they record everything you type.
So you're sitting on your computer and you're doing Google searches.
Every single Google search you type is saved and sent to the criminals.
Every single email you write is saved and sent to the criminals.
Same thing with every single password and so on.
But the thing that they're actually looking for most are sessions where you go online and do online purchases in any online store.
Because when you do purchases in online stores, you will be typing in your name, the delivery address, your credit card number and the credit card security codes.
And here's an example of a file we found from a server a couple of weeks ago.
That's the credit card number, that's the expiration date, that's the security code, and that's the name of the owner of the card.
Once you gain access to other people's credit card information, you can just go online and buy whatever you want with this information.
And that, obviously, is a problem.
We now have a whole underground marketplace and business ecosystem built around online crime.
One example of how these guys actually are capable of monetizing their operations: we go and have a look at the pages of INTERPOL and search for wanted persons.
We find guys like Bjorn Sundin, originally from Sweden, and his partner in crime, also listed on the INTERPOL wanted pages,
Mr. Shaileshkumar Jain, a U.S. citizen.
These guys were running an operation called I.M.U., a cybercrime operation through which they netted millions.
They are both right now on the run.
Nobody knows where they are.
U.S. officials, just a couple of weeks ago, froze a Swiss bank account belonging to Mr. Jain, and that bank account had 14.9 million U.S. dollars on it.
So the amount of money online crime generates is significant.
And that means that the online criminals can actually afford to invest into their attacks.
We know that online criminals are hiring programmers, hiring testing people, testing their code, having back-end systems with SQL databases.
And they can afford to watch how we work -- like how security people work -- and try to work their way around any security precautions we can build.
They also use the global nature of Internet to their advantage.
I mean, the Internet is international.
That's why we call it the Internet.
And if you just go and take a look at what's happening in the online world, here's a video built by Clarified Networks, which illustrates how one single malware family is able to move around the world.
This operation, believed to be originally from Estonia, moves around from one country to another as soon as the website is tried to shut down.
So you just can't shut these guys down.
They will switch from one country to another, from one jurisdiction to another -- moving around the world, using the fact that we don't have the capability to globally police operations like this.
So the Internet is as if someone would have given free plane tickets to all the online criminals of the world.
Now, criminals who weren't capable of reaching us before can reach us.
So how do you actually go around finding online criminals?
How do you actually track them down?
Let me give you an example.
What we have here is one exploit file.
Here, I'm looking at the Hex dump of an image file, which contains an exploit.
And that basically means, if you're trying to view this image file on your Windows computer, it actually takes over your computer and runs code.
Now, if you'll take a look at this image file -- well there's the image header, and there the actual code of the attack starts.
And that code has been encrypted, so let's decrypt it.
It has been encrypted with XOR function 97.
You just have to believe me, it is, it is.
And we can go here and actually start decrypting it.
Well the yellow part of the code is now decrypted.
And I know, it doesn't really look much different from the original.
But just keep staring at it.
You'll actually see that down here you can see a Web address: unionseek.com/d/ioo.exe
And when you view this image on your computer it actually is going to download and run that program.
And that's a backdoor which will take over your computer.
But even more interestingly, if we continue decrypting, we'll find this mysterious string, which says O600KO78RUS.
That code is there underneath the encryption as some sort of a signature.
It's not used for anything.
And I was looking at that, trying to figure out what it means.
So obviously I Googled for it.
I got zero hits; wasn't there.
So I spoke with the guys at the lab.
And we have a couple of Russian guys in our labs, and one of them mentioned, well, it ends in RUS like Russia. And 78 is the city code for the city of St. Petersburg.
For example, you can find it from some phone numbers and car license plates and stuff like that.
So I went looking for contacts in St. Petersburg, and through a long road, we eventually found this one particular website.
Here's this Russian guy who's been operating online for a number of years who runs his own website, and he runs a blog under the popular Live Journal.
And on this blog, he blogs about his life, about his life in St. Petersburg -- he's in his early 20s -- about his cat, about his girlfriend.
And he drives a very nice car.
In fact, this guy drives a Mercedes-Benz S600
V12 with a six-liter engine with more than 400 horsepower.
Now that's a nice car for a 20-something year-old kid in St. Petersburg.
How do I know about this car?
Because he blogged about the car.
He actually had a car accident.
In downtown St. Petersburg, he actually crashed his car into another car.
And he put blogged images about the car accident -- that's his Mercedes -- right here is the Lada Samara he crashed into.
And you can actually see that the license plate of the Samara ends in 78RUS.
And if you actually take a look at the scene picture, you can see that the plate of the Mercedes is O600KO78RUS.
Now I'm not a lawyer, but if I would be, this is where I would say, "I rest my case."
(Laughter)
So what happens when online criminals are caught?
Well in most cases it never gets this far.
The vast majority of the online crime cases, we don't even know which continent the attacks are coming from.
And even if we are able to find online criminals, quite often there is no outcome.
The local police don't act, or if they do, there's not enough evidence, or for some reason we can't take them down.
I wish it would be easier; unfortunately it isn't.
But things are also changing at a very rapid pace.
You've all heard about things like Stuxnet.
So if you look at what Stuxnet did is that it infected these.
That's a Siemens S7-400 PLC, programmable logic [controller].
And this is what runs our infrastructure.
This is what runs everything around us.
PLC's, these small boxes which have no display, no keyboard, which are programmed, are put in place, and they do their job.
For example, the elevators in this building most likely are controlled by one of these.
And when Stuxnet infects one of these, that's a massive revolution on the kinds of risks we have to worry about.
Because everything around us is being run by these.
I mean, we have critical infrastructure.
You go to any factory, any power plant, any chemical plant, any food processing plant, you look around -- everything is being run by computers.
Everything is being run by computers.
Everything is reliant on these computers working.
We have become very reliant on Internet, on basic things like electricity, obviously, on computers working.
And this really is something which creates completely new problems for us.
We must have some way of continuing to work even if computers fail.
(Laughter) (Applause)
So preparedness means that we can do stuff even when the things we take for granted aren't there.
It's actually very basic stuff -- thinking about continuity, thinking about backups, thinking about the things that actually matter.
Now I told you -- (Laughter)
I love the Internet.
I do.
Think about all the services we have online.
Think about if they are taken away from you, if one day you don't actually have them for some reason or another.
I see beauty in the future of the Internet, but I'm worried that we might not see that.
I'm worried that we are running into problems because of online crime.
Online crime is the one thing that might take these things away from us.
(Laughter)
I've spent my life defending the Net, and I do feel that if we don't fight online crime, we are running a risk of losing it all.
We have to do this globally, and we have to do it right now.
What we need is more global, international law enforcement work to find online criminal gangs -- these organized gangs that are making millions out of their attacks.
That's much more important than running anti-viruses or running firewalls.
What actually matters is actually finding the people behind these attacks, and even more importantly, we have to find the people who are about to become part of this online world of crime, but haven't yet done it.
We have to find the people with the skills, but without the opportunities and give them the opportunities to use their skills for good.
Thank you very much.
(Applause)
Murray Schisgal .. mm..who's been my dear friend for over 30 years er..kicked off TOOTSlE with the thought of how would you be different if you had been born a woman in a conversation we had one time not what is it feel like to be a woman cause at all sexes have asked themselves the question what is it feel like to be, what would it feel to be like the opposite sex but his question was different if..if you..if you were born a woman ..how would you be different? so that kicked off, which is..um..it would take too long to answer how we then got involved in TOOTSlE for.. ..for about 2 years before we even got it directed ..just working on different drafts of the script
But I did go to Columbia and I asked them if they would spend the money to do make-up tests so that.. I could look like a woman.
And if I couldn't look like a woman they would agree not to make the movie.
And they say: "what do you mean?"
I just somehow intuitively felt that unless I could walk down the streets of New York and not have..err..dressed as a woman.. ..and not have people turned and said: "who's that guy in drag?" or turned for any reason,..that..you know.."who's that freak?" unless I could do that, I didn't want to make the film
I didn't want to make the audience to suspend their..their..their.. their..their believability.
When we got to that point and looked at it on screen, I was shocked that I wasn't more attractive and I said: "now you have me looking like a woman, ..now make me a beautiful woman.." because I thought I should be beautiful if I was going to be a woman
I would want to be as beautiful as possible and they said to me that's as.. ..good as it gets.. er.. that's as beautiful as we can get you ..ahahah.. ...Charlie! and it was at that moment that I had an epiphany and I went home, started crying..er.. talking to my wife and I said:
I have to make this picture and she said: why? and I said: because, I think I'm an interesting woman ..when I looked at myself on screen, and I know that if I met myself at a party
I would never talk to her, that character, because.. she doesn't fulfill, physically, the demands that we're brought up to think we have..women have to have in order for us to ask them out.. she said: "what are you saying?"
and I said: "there's too many interesting women I have.. ..I have.. I..I have not had the experience to know in this life.. because I have.. ..been brainwashed. and ..
that was never a comedy for me!
Wow, I've never been a "person of interest" in a murder investigation before.
Well, just for the record Wood, it's not a good thing.
Oh, come on, it's pretty cool.
I haven't felt this important since I was
Mr. December, in the 1997 Colt Calendar, remember?
They had me completely naked, but i had that Santa hat on.
They had me on all fours with my ass in the air in that sling.
And those elves came up...
Do you mind, we're eating here!
Excuse me for wanting to relive my glory days.
Look, the guy was murdered at our house so we have to clear our names.
Somebody had to have poisoned either the food or the drinks at the party.
OK now, think
Who was around the food all night?
You were.
Who was around the bar drinking all night?
You were.
Okay.
What about the caterer?
You guys should go talk to her.
Us!
Why us?
You're the one who hired her.
I can't.
I have an audition later.
(laughter)
For what?
It's a very high profile audition for the Disney Channel.
It's a show called Super Hoops.
It's about a junior high school basketball team that all realizing they have super powers.
And I play the unsuspecting gym teacher.
Gym teacher?
Nelson, why don't you audition for roles that you can actually book?
But you know what, I heard they are making a new bio-pic on John Wayne Gacy.
Oh my god, he would be perfect for that.
I know, he dressed up as a clown and worked kids parties too!
And he's the same weight...
Oh, come on!
John Wayne Gacy!
Really?!
Hey, you don't know who's casting that do you?
No.
All right, look.
I'm gonna go on this audition, alright.
And I'm gonna book it too.
And you, your unemployed.
And you are supposedly a travel writer.
Even though I've never seen any article.
Have you?
You set your own schedule.
So you guys have plenty of time to go talk to the caterer.
I can't I have a job interview today.
But, you know what, I could blow it off.
I just probably won't have this month's rent.
Forget it!
You owe me last month's rent too.
Plus that extra fee for paying after the 5th.
Whatever.
What about you?
I can't. I have a date.
With who?
Him.
You don't even know him.
I know, but he just sent me a message on Growlr.
And, he's got my entire checklist.
BDSM, Kink, Raunch, Leather, Jock Straps, Cock Ring, Tit- Clamps, both Dom and Submissive.
That's your checklist!!
Who are you, the Marquis de Sade?
What is some of that stuff?
I don't even know what some of that stuff is!
Is it even legal?!
Look, ok fine. I'll go talk to the caterer alright.
But you know what?
You don't see me dropping everything for some guy.
(phone rings)
Oh my God!!
It's him!
Give it Wood!
Hello.
Oh, hey Babe.
No I'm just sitting here thinking about you.
Well yah.
Apparently somebody poisoned him at our party.
Yah, Wood found a martini glass that was near the dead body.
And we think it might have been his cocktail.
I know.
Alright, text me later.
Bye.
So?
Did he go by the police station to give an interview?
No.
He had a good excuse.
He worked a double shift and he was exhausted.
Ok fine.
I know what you guys are thinking.
You're thinking. What's he hiding?
And what is a hot guy like him with a guy like me. Right?
We didn't say that.
Why is it so hard to believe?
That a hot stud like Todd would wanna be with somebody like me?
Come on.
That guy wants to be with you Reggie.
And you're average looking too.
Average!
Really?!
Well, would an average guy can get a hit from someone less than 250 feet away.
Yah! That's right.
I can go around the corner and top that hot Armenian guy at the flower mart, or I could bottom for this guy over here.
Which you know what, I think that's what I'm gonna do right now.
Because I am definitely NOT AVERAGE!
Okay, I've been going over my cell phone video from the party to see if there was anybody else there that we didn't know, besides J Cub.
Yeah, and?
And...
Voila!!
Who's that guy?
I don't know.
But he was following me around all night.
Hi, do I know you?
Don't mind me.
I'm just standing here, swimming in the elegance of your ungodly manliness.
All right, well.
You take care.
Where's he from, Middle Earth?
Who invited a Hobbit to my birthday?
I specifically said I only wanted hot bears.
Somebody's got to know who he is and where we can find him.
OK, you know what, I'll go in to the Evites.
I'll check and see who rsvp +1, then we'll call people and maybe someone will know who he is.
That's a great idea.
You know what I can do.
I could look at his card.
I bet it has some kind of contact info on it.
What card?
He gave me his card at the party.
HE GAVE YOU HlS CARD!!
COULDN'T YOU HAVE TOLD US THlS BEFORE?
YOU MORON!
Well, excuse me, but I'm the only one that came up with a clue!
You need to get a clue, Wood!
George Ridgemont.
Wood Burns, as I live and breath.
These are my friends. This is Nelson and Reggie.
Hello.
Come in.
Come in.
Excuse this little outfit.
I just got home from Pilates.
I've got to thank you for the other night.
It was such a good time.
It's always nice to spend an evening with good friends.
Good wine.
Sit, sit.
No, no.
That's okay.
Can't stay.
As much as we'd love to.
For maybe some... fashion tips.
Listen, George, we really glad, that you came to our party... but, we're sort of wondering.
Who the hell are you?!
I'm George Ridgemeont.
Yeah, we know that from your card, but who are you?
Okay, maybe..
Maybe it's pointless to continue with this little charade of mine.
I'm sure by now,
You know the little crime I committed.
So you poisoned the naked bear cup?!
No, I crashed your party.
To see him.
In the flesh.
Wood, really?
Why?
You might say that I'm a connoisseur of the male form.
And all it's attributes.
You collect gay porn.
In layman's terms, yes.
But I have every video.
Every photograph.
Every book that ever featured this tall hunk of a man.
So, when one of my Dental patience mentioned to me. under anesthesia, of course. that Mr. Burns was having a party for one of his friends.
I thought this is my chance.
I'll sneak in. I'll crash.
I'll get a glimpse of the real thing.
Well, uh..
I hope you weren't disappointed.
I thought you'd be taller.
Okay, okay, wait a minute.
Let me get this straight.
So, you have a dental practice on the shire?
And you drug your Hobbit patients so you will have a social life on the weekends.
Nelson, stop.
We need to know.
Do you know this man?
Don't know him, but I did see him the other night at your party.
He was arguing with some guy.
With who?
Long, tall, drink of a man.
Big mustache.
Said he lost half of his body weight.
When you lost all that weight, you threw away everything.
Our comedy act was called "The 2 Fat Guys".
I had high blood pressure, Diabetes and a pulmonary embolism the sizer of a smart car.
So, you'll forgive me If I chose my health over our stupid little comedy act.
So, you lose a limb.
Dickie Calloway.
Dickie Calloway.
That's the one.
He's a big star now.
Big star.
Big star?
Okay, that is a stretch, Frodo.
Right, he's just a working actor.
Okay, you know what.
Dickie Calloway is only a working actor because he is a dick!
One time, he actually slashed the tires of another actor.
Just so he could get the part as the "Banana Guy" in the Fruit of The Loom Campaign.
I would so, not be surprised, If Dickie, were the killer.
Oh, dear God. Why don't you guys just go get a room.
So a couple of years ago I started a program to try to get the rockstar tech and design people to take a year off and work in the one environment that represents pretty much everything they're supposed to hate; we have them work in government.
The program is called Code for America, and it's a little bit like a Peace Corps for geeks.
We select a few fellows every year and we have them work with city governments.
Instead of sending them off into the Third World, we send them into the wilds of City Hall.
And there they make great apps, they work with city staffers.
But really what they're doing is they're showing what's possible with technology today.
So meet Al.
Al is a fire hydrant in the city of Boston.
Here it kind of looks like he's looking for a date, but what he's really looking for is for someone to shovel him out when he gets snowed in, because he knows he's not very good at fighting fires when he's covered in four feet of snow.
Now how did he come to be looking for help in this very unique manner?
We had a team of fellows in Boston last year through the Code for America program.
They were there in February, and it snowed a lot in February last year.
And they noticed that the city never gets to digging out these fire hydrants.
But one fellow in particular, a guy named Erik Michaels-Ober, noticed something else, and that's that citizens are shoveling out sidewalks right in front of these things.
So he did what any good developer would do, he wrote an app.
It's a cute little app where you can adopt a fire hydrant.
So you agree to dig it out when it snows.
If you do, you get to name it, and he called the first one Al.
And if you don't, someone can steal it from you.
So it's got cute little game dynamics on it.
This is a modest little app.
It's probably the smallest of the 21 apps that the fellows wrote last year.
But it's doing something that no other government technology does.
It's spreading virally.
There's a guy in the I.T. department of the City of Honolulu who saw this app and realized that he could use it, not for snow, but to get citizens to adopt tsunami sirens.
It's very important that these tsunami sirens work, but people steal the batteries out of them.
So he's getting citizens to check on them.
And then Seattle decided to use it to get citizens to clear out clogged storm drains.
And Chicago just rolled it out to get people to sign up to shovel sidewalks when it snows.
So we now know of nine cities that are planning to use this.
And this has spread just frictionlessly, organically, naturally.
If you know anything about government technology, you know that this isn't how it normally goes.
Procuring software usually takes a couple of years.
We had a team that worked on a project in Boston last year that took three people about two and a half months.
It was a way that parents could figure out which were the right public schools for their kids.
We were told afterward that if that had gone through normal channels, it would have taken at least two years and it would have cost about two million dollars.
And that's nothing.
There is one project in the California court system right now that so far cost taxpayers two billion dollars, and it doesn't work.
And there are projects like this at every level of government.
So an app that takes a couple of days to write and then spreads virally, that's sort of a shot across the bow to the institution of government.
It suggests how government could work better -- not more like a private company, as many people think it should.
And not even like a tech company, but more like the Internet itself.
And that means permissionless, it means open, it means generative.
And that's important.
But what's more important about this app is that it represents how a new generation is tackling the problem of government -- not as the problem of an ossified institution, but as a problem of collective action.
And that's great news, because, it turns out, we're very good at collective action with digital technology.
Now there's a very large community of people that are building the tools that we need to do things together effectively.
It's not just Code for America fellows, there are hundreds of people all over the country that are standing and writing civic apps every day in their own communities.
They haven't given up on government.
They are frustrated as hell with it, but they're not complaining about it, they're fixing it.
And these folks know something that we've lost sight of.
And that's that when you strip away all your feelings about politics and the line at the DMV and all those other things that we're really mad about, government is, at its core, in the words of Tim O'Reilly,
"What we do together that we can't do alone."
Now a lot of people have given up on government.
And if you're one of those people, I would ask that you reconsider, because things are changing.
Politics is not changing; government is changing.
And because government ultimately derives its power from us -- remember "We the people?" -- how we think about it is going to effect how that change happens.
Now I didn't know very much about government when I started this program.
And like a lot of people, I thought government was basically about getting people elected to office.
Well after two years, I've come to the conclusion that, especially local government, is about opossums.
This is the call center for the services and information line.
It's generally where you will get if you call 311 in your city.
If you should ever have the chance to staff your city's call center, as our fellow Scott Silverman did as part of the program -- in fact, they all do that -- you will find that people call government with a very wide range of issues, including having an opossum stuck in your house.
So Scott gets this call.
He types "Opossum" into this official knowledge base.
He doesn't really come up with anything.
He starts with animal control.
And finally, he says, "Look, can you just open all the doors to your house and play music really loud and see if the thing leaves?"
So that worked.
So booya for Scott.
But that wasn't the end of the opossums.
Boston doesn't just have a call center.
It has an app, a Web and mobile app, called Citizens Connect.
Now we didn't write this app.
This is the work of the very smart people at the Office of New Urban Mechanics in Boston.
So one day -- this is an actual report -- this came in:
"Opossum in my trashcan.
Can't tell if it's dead.
How do I get this removed?"
But what happens with Citizens Connect is different.
So Scott was speaking person-to-person.
But on Citizens Connect everything is public, so everybody can see this.
And in this case, a neighbor saw it.
And the next report we got said,
"I walked over to this location, found the trashcan behind the house.
Opossum?
Check.
Living?
Yep.
Turned trashcan on its side.
Walked home.
Goodnight sweet opossum."
(Laughter)
Pretty simple.
So this is great.
This is the digital meeting the physical.
And it's also a great example of government getting in on the crowd-sourcing game.
But it's also a great example of government as a platform.
And I don't mean necessarily a technological definition of platform here.
I'm just talking about a platform for people to help themselves and to help others.
So one citizen helped another citizen, but government played a key role here.
It connected those two people.
And it could have connected them with government services if they'd been needed, but a neighbor is a far better and cheaper alternative to government services.
When one neighbor helps another, we strengthen our communities.
We call animal control, it just costs a lot of money.
Now one of the important things we need to think about government is that it's not the same thing as politics.
And most people get that, but they think that one is the input to the other.
That our input to the system of government is voting.
Now how many times have we elected a political leader -- and sometimes we spend a lot of energy getting a new political leader elected -- and then we sit back and we expect government to reflect our values and meet our needs, and then not that much changes?
That's because government is like a vast ocean and politics is the six-inch layer on top.
And what's under that is what we call bureaucracy.
And we say that word with such contempt.
But it's that contempt that keeps this thing that we own and we pay for as something that's working against us, this other thing, and then we're disempowering ourselves.
People seem to think politics is sexy.
If we want this institution to work for us, we're going to have to make bureaucracy sexy.
Because that's where the real work of government happens.
We have to engage with the machinery of government.
So that's OccupytheSEC movement has done.
Have you seen these guys?
It's a group of concerned citizens that have written a very detailed 325-page report that's a response to the SEC's request for comment on the Financial Reform Bill.
That's not being politically active, that's being bureaucratically active.
Now for those of us who've given up on government, it's time that we asked ourselves about the world that we want to leave for our children.
You have to see the enormous challenges that they're going to face.
Do we really think we're going to get where we need to go without fixing the one institution that can act on behalf of all of us?
We can't do without government, but we do need it to be more effective.
The good news is that technology is making it possible to fundamentally reframe the function of government in a way that can actually scale by strengthening civil society.
And there's a generation out there that's grown up on the Internet, and they know that it's not that hard to do things together, you just have to architect the systems the right way.
Now the average age of our fellows is 28, so I am, begrudgingly, almost a generation older than most of them.
This is a generation that's grown up taking their voices pretty much for granted.
They're not fighting that battle that we're all fighting about who gets to speak; they all get to speak.
They can express their opinion on any channel at any time, and they do.
So when they're faced with the problem of government, they don't care as much about using their voices.
They're using their hands.
They're using their hands to write applications that make government work better.
And those applications let us use our hands to make our communities better.
That could be shoveling out a hydrant, pulling a weed, turning over a garbage can with an opossum in it.
And certainly, we could have been shoveling out those fire hydrants all along, and many people do.
But these apps are like little digital reminders that we're not just consumers, and we're not just consumers of government, putting in our taxes and getting back services.
We're more than that, we're citizens.
And we're not going to fix government until we fix citizenship.
So the question I have for all of you here:
When it comes to the big, important things that we need to do together, all of us together, are we just going to be a crowd of voices, or are we also going to be a crowd of hands?
Thank you.
(Applause)
So let's jump right in to pharmacokinetics.
So the first thing we want to do is be able to answer the question, what is pharmacokinetics and cover some basic definitions.
And the easiest way to understand pharmacokinetics is to differentiate it from pharmacodynamics.
So when you look at this word, pharmacokinetics, what is the first thing that you think of?
Well, you should say pharmaco that means drug and kinetics, you should be thinking motion.
And this is to differentiate pharmacokinetics from pharmacodynamics.
Now, pharmaco again means drug.
Dynamics comes from this word dynamus which really means power.
So when I think of pharmacokinetics, I'm thinking of a drug and I'm thinking of that drug moving through our body.
So what happens as a drug moves through our body?
Well the concentration changes and that's really what pharmacokinetics is looking at.
PK, pharmacokinetics, is really answering the question of how does the drug concentration change as it moves through the different compartments of your body. That is pharmacokinetics my friend. This is different than pharmacodynamics.
&lt;i&gt; Flnal Episode
Abracadabra...Goo Jun Pyo, remember Geum Jan Di, remember Geum Jan Di...
Abracadabra, abracadabra..!!
Ohhh!! You scared mee!
You little brat!! What the hell are you doing here?? i also think that,I think you've been under a lot of stress lately.
You're getting a zit on that good-looking face of yours.
What is this?
Can't you see, it's a lunchbox.
Lunchbox?
Is it good??
This...
- You made this? &lt;BR&gt;- What??
Yeah...if it's good, I'll bring it again next time.!
You must be thirsty.
Do you want me to go get you some water?
I remember.!
The person that I forgot.. is you, right?
Here you go.
Thank you.
Come back again. Welco ...
- One order of abalone porridge.
- And one order of pumpkin porridge.
Sunbae...
What brings you guys here?
Can't you see?
We came to eat porridge.
- Ahh, I'm so full. &lt;BR&gt;- Me too.
Now tell us, is there something wrong?
For Geum JanDi who can't even take care of her boyfriend because of her job...we brought some news.
Huh?
JunPyo finally got discharged.
R..Really?
How can you guys say something so important after you're done eating?
Hurry up and go.
I'll be back.
Sunbae, you're not going?
No. I came here because of you.
They look happy...the pottery that's in there. Instead of suffering from the heat, they rather look happy.
Why?
Because if they endure it, once they come out, they will be loved...they hold that hope.
That's so like Gaeul.
You can tell me now.
I'm ready.
You have something to say, right?
Would you like the bad news first again?
I'm ... ....leaving.
If you think about it, that might not be such bad news for you.
Where to?
Sweden.
When....no - or how long? - Soon
Probably about four to five years.
That's great.
You'll be an even greater potter.
If you think about it, this can also be good news...so what's the other news?
When I come back.... ....you'll be the first one I look for.
Sunbae...
I mean, that's only if by that time, you still haven't found your soulmate.
Put more firewood! The pottery has to be 1300 degrees C!
Goo JunPyo, congrats on your discharge.....
Oh, it's JanDi Unnie.
Hi, JanDi Unnie!
Oh, hi.
Yumi, you're here, too.
What are you doing here?
JiHoo is not here.
I heard that you were discharged. Just wanted to say congrats.
How nosy you are!
Why don't you just take care of your own boyfriend.
Does JiHoo know that you're going around like this?
- Hey, watch what you say.
- What?
JiHoo Sunbae has no reason to hear such things from you.
Then why don't you behave so it's not so embarrassing.
Fine.
I shouldn't have come.
You just take care of youself.
What's wrong with you, Oppa.
You're so mean.
Unnie, don't go.
Tea's coming.
Oppa's tea is really good.
Have some tea.
Tea is ready.
Bring it here, please.
Unnie, come sit over here.
Oh, it looks so good.
Ah! I'll do it myself
Is it good?
I spilled it all over.
You should try it.
Mmmm, tastes good.
I'm leaving
You... don't come back again.
Whenever I see you, my mood turns sour.
You get on my nerves.
I get it. I'm sorry.
I won't come back again!
Unni!
The person that JunPyo oppa has to remember, is that you, by any chance?
I'm right.
But as you can see, seeing you isn't good for him.
Whenever he sees you, his condition worsens.
So, from the moment on, it's best if you don't come here anymore.
But don't worry. Every chance I get, I'll work really hard to try and get him to remember you.
Take care, then.
- Make me that. &lt;BR&gt;- What?
- That lunchbox that you made last time.&lt;BR&gt;- Lunchbox?
The rolled eggs that you made for me at the hospital.
Make that for me again.
Ahhh, that.
Okay, oppa.
But there are so many more tasty foods to eat here.
Why do you want to eat that?
I'm sorry.
-Sunbae? &lt;BR&gt; -Don't escape.
- Let me go. &lt;BR&gt;- No!
You can't back off now.
Jandi!
It's all over now.
It's useless now
You see, I believed that even though he lost his memory, even if we had to start all over again, that he'd recognize me.
But, the fact is I was wrong.
-That's not it. &lt;BR&gt; -No.
I may be upset and feel cheated, but I have to accept it.
The Goo Joonpyo that I liked, the Goo Joonpyo who loved me, doesn't exist anymore.
I told you, you can't become like the little mermaid
I refuse to accept that you, two will break up over something as nonsensical as this. i can't accept it
It's not because of Yumi.
Ultimately, Goo Joonpyo and Geum Jandi... It's the end for us
Eat it all
What's wrong?
Does it taste bad?
-This isn't it. &lt;BR&gt;-Huh?
This isn't the same flavor as before.
Did you really make that other one?
Uh, of course.
Of course I made it.
Who else would have?
It's just that each time you make it, it tastes a little different.
Next time, I'll make it just right.
Is there something making you feel bad?
That girl...
Jandi or Japcho ("lawn" or "weed"), that girl's expression...
I can't erase it from my mind.
You're too much.
How could you?
From the time you were in the hospital until now, I was the one who has been at your side.
But that un-nee who pops up every now and then to irritate you, she gets stuck in your mind?
Your friends treat me like crap and always take that un-nee's side.
And that un-nee's boyfriend treats me as though I have some disease, completely ignoring me.
But, for you...because I was worried about you, I put up with it all...
But, if you act like this too, then what am I supposed to do?
Hey!
What's the matter? &lt;i&gt;Invitation:
"Surprise pool party thrown by Goo Joonpyo and Chang Yumi"
Un-nee, you came!
- Have you been well?&lt;BR&gt;- I'm glad you came, I have something to report to you.
Report....?
Oppa still can't remember you.
- Is that so?&lt;BR&gt;- And one other thing...
I'm sorry for you, but I like Joonpyo oppa.
What?
It's not that I did it on purpose; it just happened.
I like him so much that I can't part from him.
Oppa feels the same way as I do.
Sorry. I know you'll understand, right?
A person's heart can't be controlled the way we want...
Oh, look at the time...
I need to tell everyone the reason for this party. Reason?
Un-nee, come over in a little bit.
Don't collapse now.
Let's go hear what they have to say.
We invited you all here because we have a special announcement to make.
Goo Joonpyo and Jang Yumi, we have decided to study in America next month.
What?
What is that girl talking about?
Study abroad?
I'm going to continue my studies and oppa will carry on with his business.
Don't feel too sad while we're gone, and be happy until we meet again.
That girl is something else.
It's a shock to get hit in the back of the head like this.
Let's go.
I'll get you a glass of warm water.
Goo JoonPyo!
Do you remember this?
What is it?
You don't remember the names on this?
JJ
How would I know something like this? I'll return it. Take it back.
Why would I take something like this?
If you want to get rid of it, throw it away yourself.
Yeah.
Goo JoonPyo.
I'll ask just once more, just one more question.
What now?
Do you know how to swim?
Swim?
I don't swim.
Don't swim or can't swim?
Because of a bad experience when I was a kid, I don't swim.
I've never done it.
No.
You do know how to swim
What are you?
Who do you think you are to blab off about me.
You don't fear anything in the world, but you're so scared of bugs, you shake.
You the idiot who would rather his ribs all bust apart than see one finger on his woman hurt.
You're the idiot who doesn't know the difference between "privacy" and "pride" who insists that the 38th parallel are train tracks.
You freak out when it comes to kids, but... you want to be a devoted father... who will go out and look at the stars with his son.
You're a lonely but loving guy.
Who do you think you are?
That's who you are, Goo Joonpyo.
I'm asking who you are?
You call it out.
My name.
Geum JanDi.
JanDi yah!!
Geum JanDi...wake up!
JanDi....Geum JanDi!!
Are you all right?
Do you remember now?
Geum JanDi...you scare me like that one more time and you're dead!
You remember....
I'm sorry...
I'm sorry...
Say it again....my name.
Jan Di...
It seems like just yesterday that our Jandi started high school, yet it's already graduation.
I'm sorry mom that I can't get a job or go to college like others do.
Noona, you don't have to take a test to go to Shinhwa University, isn't it the same for medical school?
If I want to get a scholarship, I have to take the test.
No, your life has been full of obstacles, now, I want you to do what you want to do.
And by the way, what are you wearing to the graduation?
I'm not going...
Why would I....
Aren't you a graduate of ShinHwa?
Why wouldn't you go?
Please don't concern yourself.
Come out to the front of your house.
Congratulations on your graduation.
Thanks!
Do you really need to go to medical school?
Why?
What are you about to say?
There's no guarantee that studying for another year is going to help. And? If any, think about it...a doctor like you?
You'd probably cut them up.
What?
Even without a scalpel (surgical knife) you cut people up.
You...didn't really come to congratulate me on my graduation, did you?
You came to make fun of me, right?
Ah, hey!
Hey, Geum Jandi, tomorrow, you...
Got it?
If you're late again this time, you're dead!
Go on in and sleep.
It's F4!! Grandpa! I'll throw the garbage out and then get your tea
Oh, okay.
That little rascal... Came already!
Geum Jandi!
Why did you come this late?
Oh, well, I...
You weren't planning to just skip this last event, were you?
We're not even high schoolers, so why do you think we're here?
Huh?
The great F4 have been waiting all day to dance with Geum Jandi.
Miss Jandi, would you do me the great honor of dancing with me?
- With me? &lt;BR&gt;- Let's go.
No, just a minute... Woobin sunbae, who was the backbone and support of F4...
I know that you are always one step behind, offering your heart in support...
I know that now.
Although you act cold and mean... in reality, you are warmer and more pure than others.
Thanks to you, I think that Gaeul has experienced a beautiful love.
Don't you think it's time to give others a turn?
Rascal...
What can I do since my clothes are like this? &lt;BR&gt; It's perfect.
Don't you think it's the perfect outfit for Geum Jandi to finish her high school life?
As if having falling into a wonderland like Alice.... It will go to the emergency bell, the possibility which it will meet you there is a fact. .&lt;br/&gt; Do you knowhow comforting it is... Sunbae?
You're like someone sent from the heaven to me like bonus....
I'll never be able to forget you...
My soulmate...JiHoo Sunbae....
Thank you.
What happened to JunPyo??
His phone is off.
Do you think something's happened?
You....tomorrow..... All right?
Saturday. 4 pm. Front of NamSan Tower.
I...have to...leave first.... You're crazy until the end.
Geum JanDi!
Didn't I say that if you were late, you'd be dead?
You're even late on a day like this... You always just do whatever you want. It's not some kind of magic.
This kind of thing...
It's easy ..
Compared to grassland management
Come here
It's a coffee that costs $36.3.
Drink it up!
Let's go.
It's been a long time since we've been here huh?
Is it open??
Why don't I see anyone here??
I rented it.
What?
I basically bought it until the morning.
And I also have something to show you.
Come here. I told you there's something I want to show you!
What's wrong with you...there's something I want to show you...
You...do you already know?
You...do you intend to make it so that I can't get married?
You just need to marry me.
Who were you going to marry???
Move.
Just move aside.
Goo Jun Pyo loves Geum Jan Di &lt;br/&gt; Our first night together!!! &lt;3
It's still here!!
Now you can not get married.
Geum Jan Di.
Listen carefully to what I have to say...
So ominous... W-...W-...What is it now???
Us......
Let's get married...
Married?
Yes, married.
Why are you suddenly joking around like that?? I'm not joking
I've just barely graduated from high school.
I.... ...have to go to the U.S.
U.S?
This time, it's not because of my mom..... ...and not because of the business...
It was my decision.
Killing off a living dad...forcing an offspring to marry... or having to lobby all the time. I don't want that kind of corporation.
I'm.... ...going to try my best.
So...if I can save the corporation then that's great... but if I can't... then I'll shut it down with my own hands.
How long will it take? ......4 years.
At least it will be 4 years...
For that long??...
So.....come with me then.
I can't..
What???
Why can't you??
When you went to Macau..... ....I made a decision, too..
About my dreams and my futuree..
What is it that I want and what is it that I want to do.
Like you..... ...the thing that I want to try my best at ,and do my best...is right here... So??? Have a good trip....
Whatt??
I said, "Have a good trip."
4 years later, if you come back as a great man, I will think about it again then..
Geum Jan Di.
Are you serious
You are going to regret for letting me go
Hey, you are the one who is going to regret it! Alright, you win
I already know... that I would regret until I die for letting you go
Goo Joon Pyo
You might not be as stupid as you look
You wanna die?
4 years later &lt;i&gt;Shinhwa group's managing Director, Goo JunPyo covers 3 international economic magazines. Today, we have Goo JunPyo, the executive director of ShinHwa Group who succeed in establishing a strategic alliance with the Global Soft Inc. this month which has been internationally recognized and brought Korea into the spotlight.
Thank you for coming on our show. Hello. I heard not too long ago that you are the first Korean to be on the cover of 3 international economic magazines.
Congratulations.
-Thank you.
We'll change the topic a little bit now. The viewers, especially the women in Korea, would like to hear some personal information.
Of course, you're managing an international company, but you're also in the prime of your 20s
So I'm sure you're lonely sometimes.
How do you overcome that?
Dating or love.
It seems like you're curious about these aspects of my life.
You certainly have a faster understanding of things than others.
Yes.
Well, to say I wasn't lonely or had it hard is probably a lie.
But because of a promise I made with someone, I was able to rely on that and endure it.
It shows that you have someone special in your heart. yes...well
A lover?
Lately, there's been a lot of rumors about your marriage.
Since you're already here. How about you tell us a little about who she is?
Is that a grape?
-Yes
You're still putting too much pressure in your hands.
YiJung Sunbae...
Hi
Who is he?
Is he teacher's boyfriend?
Mister did you just come back from another country ?
Oh, how did you know?
Then, did you just come back from Sweden?
Little miss, you're really amazing.
Then you're him!
Our teacher said her boyfriend was there.
You can't tell him that!
Hey wait!
Wait!
Wait!
Thank you!
Hey, third repeater.
Are you late even on a day like today?
Not a day goes by that you don't cause trouble..
I'm sorry, Sunbae-nim.
I'm sorry.
Do you think it'll end like that?
Sunbae!
Hey, Geum JanDi!
-Yes.
Can't you do this properly?
What is this?
I'm sorry.
Do it again.
Hurry!
-I'm sorry Sunbae-nim..
You came?
By the look on your face, looks like you made another mistake.
Sunbae, since you entered on time, you're already in the graduating class...
When am I, a third-year ever going to finish and in what millennium will I become a doctor?
The future sure looks dark. You're not worried about flunking?
Sunbae!
It's because of you that I've lasted this long as an outcast.
When I think about what I'm going to do when you go to the hospital, it looks dark..
Then, should I repeat too?
Aigoo, that's all right.
That's scarier than a flunking joke.
It's not a joke.
Sunbae, you have to hurry and become a doctor so you can reopen your grandfather's clinic..
That's why you went back and studied.. That wasn't the only reason.
What?
Doctor prince, my throat hurts.
Doctor prince?
SaeByul is going to grow up and marry Doctor Prince later in the future.
We'll get married next time.
Right now, say "ah'.
Commoner, can you hear me?
Geum JanDi respond.
Are you there Geum JanDi?
If you're there, come meet me on the beach. Goo JoonPyo?.
Goo Joon Pyo?
You took 5 minutes!
Can't you walk faster?!
Goo JoonPyo.
What's going on?
What do you mean?
Goo JoonPyo has come back for Geum JanDi.
Seeing you wearing this white gown, I guess ugly ducklings can become swans after all.
It's Goo JoonPyo.
You're really Goo JoonPyo.
I missed you.
Enough to die.
I'm not going to let you go again.
You promised, didn't you?
When I returned, you'd take responsibility for me.
Look here, Mr. Goo JoonPyo with a bad memory.
I said when you returned in four years, I would think about it. I never said I would take responsibility.
Your memory is bad too, but you remember that well.
In my memory, there was another condition.
What?
The one about if you come back as a really amazing man.
Can you really say that in front of the great Goo JunPyo?
Geum JanDi...
Please marry this great Goo JunPyo.
I object to that proposal!
I also object!
Me too! You guys can't do that so easily without our permission.
Ladies and gentlemen, at TED we talk a lot about leadership and how to make a movement.
So let's watch a movement happen, start to finish, in under three minutes and dissect some lessons from it.
First, of course you know, a leader needs the guts to stand out and be ridiculed.
What he's doing is so easy to follow.
Here's his first follower with a crucial role; he's going to show everyone else how to follow.
Now, notice that the leader embraces him as an equal.
Now it's not about the leader anymore; it's about them, plural.
Now, there he is calling to his friends.
Now, if you notice that the first follower is actually an underestimated form of leadership in itself.
It takes guts to stand out like that.
The first follower is what transforms a lone nut into a leader.
(Laughter) (Applause)
And here comes a second follower.
Now it's not a lone nut, it's not two nuts -- three is a crowd, and a crowd is news.
So a movement must be public.
It's important to show not just the leader, but the followers, because you find that new followers emulate the followers, not the leader.
Now, here come two more people, and immediately after, three more people.
Now we've got momentum. This is the tipping point.
Now we've got a movement. (Laughter)
So, notice that, as more people join in, it's less risky.
So those that were sitting on the fence before now have no reason not to.
They won't stand out, they won't be ridiculed, but they will be part of the in-crowd if they hurry.
(Laughter)
So, over the next minute, you'll see all of those that prefer to stick with the crowd because eventually they would be ridiculed for not joining in. And that's how you make a movement.
But let's recap some lessons from this.
So first, if you are the type, like the shirtless dancing guy that is standing alone, remember the importance of nurturing your first few followers as equals so it's clearly about the movement, not you. (Laughter)
Okay, but we might have missed the real lesson here.
The biggest lesson, if you noticed -- did you catch it? -- is that leadership is over-glorified. Yes, it was the shirtless guy who was first, and he'll get all the credit, but it was really the first follower that transformed the lone nut into a leader.
So, as we're told that we should all be leaders, that would be really ineffective.
If you really care about starting a movement, have the courage to follow and show others how to follow.
And when you find a lone nut doing something great, have the guts to be the first one to stand up and join in.
And what a perfect place to do that, at TED.
Thanks.
(Applause)

[Music plays] It's Nothing, Nothing, Nothing!
I would like to introduce you a little bit to the many forces that come to visit this body over the years; from different dimensions also.
And each one is defeated like that.
So much so, that when you look back and I hear things like this I can say, It's nothing!
'And this and that...' It's nothing!
'But this thing...' Nothing!
'Yeah, but last night an angel...' Nothing!
'Yesterday I almost died.' There is nothing! Yeah.
'I had an experience, it was so...' Nothing!
'I want to be free.' Nothing!
Nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing! [Laughter]
'I have to tell you about now, because something is tightening up.' [Mooji makes squeaking sound]
I say, Nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing!
Nothing!
'I sat in the cave and it was...' Nothing, nothing!
'What you speak about...' Nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing.
Just you amusing yourself.
It's nothing.
How many times you thought, 'Oh, this is my last day, aah!'
'Hmmm?' Nothing!
Nothing, nothing, nothing!
One day this body, Plup. Nothing! It's nothing!
Nobody here is going to convince me it is something.
Get over it. [Laughter and clapping]
And it is precisely that because I don't accept your version of yourself and I don't believe you, yes, is the only reason I can serve you.
Because I cannot accept the things you say about yourself.
They are simply not true.
I know you.
I know every single being.
When I look in your eyes, I know who dwells there.
And I know the state of that one to be perfect and holy.
So everything else you say, for a few moments,
Ah, okay, okay.
Okay. Waiting for a chance for you to say,
'And then, actually, all that that I saw is nothing.'
I go, Ha-haa! [Laughter]
But still you persist and go on, 'And this thing came last night, and it was so big, and I had a dream, and in this dream I saw, I saw...'
It's nothing!
'And what happens though after I die?'
Nothing, nothing, nothing.
Don't... nothing, nothing, nothing. [Quick cutting movements and sounds]
You see?
So I say sometimes, it's like I used to say, a samurai comes to you, a divine samurai, and he says, 'I've come to take what I cannot have.'
'Give me.' And you say...
'I've come for your... I've come.'
And you go, 'Okay, okay, take all my possessions.'
[Cutting sound]
'I don't want that.
That's already mine.'
'Take all my learning.' [Cutting sound]
'It's not this.'
'Take all my experience.' [Cutting sounds]
'Not this.' 'Take my devotion.' [Cutting sound]
'Take my family.' [Fast cutting sounds followed by laughter] 'Take my future.' [Cutting]
'Past.' [Cutting]
'Present.' [Cutting] 'Take me.' [Cutting sound]
Where have you come to?
Because everything is telling me about where you have been.
But what about where are you now?
Where are you, if you stop talking about where you've visited, what you've thought, what will you want, what... the story.
[Fast cutting sounds] And this thing, I say to you like this, all you,
It was this story that Papa told me, I say like this.
About one girl and she was just about to get married, no?
And she was... the next day, she is getting married the next day.
And she has been planning everything for this wedding, because it's a traditional place and in this place you don't get to be with your beloved in any intimate way until you are married.
So tomorrow is the wedding; no, tomorrow is the wedding day, yes.
And so today she must make the final arrangement. And this girl lives in the forest.
She lives in a forest and she is now, today, final arrangements; she has a few appointments.
'First I must go to the cake maker.
And after the cake maker, I must see the dress maker.
After the dress maker, I must go and see the priest; to go through my vows and then finally, at the end of the day, I will see my beloved, and we will have a cup of tea together; look forward to tomorrow.
And then tomorrow I will be, we will be in each other's arms; ooh, wonderful.' And she is full of the joys of spring.
And she is walking out in the forest to go to see the cake maker, first appointment on the list.
And after few steps, right in front of her steps a lion. Face to face like this.
Hungry lion also.
And she can feel its breath, [Mooji makes loud breathing sound] Like this.
[Breath out]
Then in that instant, you see? [Cutting sound] The cake maker's appointment is gone.
Then, the dress maker. [Cutting sound]
It's not there.
The priest. [Cutting sound]
It's not there. Only the beloved.
[Cutting sound]
Also not there.
In this moment absolutely alone.
No time, no future, no intention, no past, no identity.
So the master says, 'Welcome the lion on your path.'
Because until then you are planning a tomorrow you don't have, a next week that nobody promised, and all of this.
And our minds are full of the noise of otherness.
What will bring you to this instant, this moment?
When will you spend one moment to be just you?
Not carrying some message for tomorrow or something. You see?
And this is a habit that all of us we have it.
And so we are full of noise, claustrophobic with noise.
What will strip you back to that place?
Beyond time and intention, you see?
How far are you from this place now?
What's left to do?
What unfinished business is left to do, before you can simply be your Being, be your Self?
Because the mind is not going to have a holiday.
[Silence] There is something that is not in the next moment, not in the past moment, also.
You can... don't look anywhere to find it.
Even your very search to find it, is already arising in it. We are missing the obvious.
Don't seek help from your mind.
What will strip you back to this place beyond time and intention?
What unfinished business is left to do before you can simply be your Being?
THE ADVENTURES OF SHERLOCK HOLMES by SlR ARTHUR CONAN DOYLE
ADVENTURE I. A SCANDAL IN BOHEMlA
I. To Sherlock Holmes she is always THE woman.
I have seldom heard him mention her under any other name.
In his eyes she eclipses and predominates the whole of her sex.
It was not that he felt any emotion akin to love for Irene Adler.
All emotions, and that one particularly, were abhorrent to his cold, precise but admirably balanced mind.
He was, I take it, the most perfect reasoning and observing machine that the world has seen, but as a lover he would have placed himself in a false position.
He never spoke of the softer passions, save with a gibe and a sneer.
They were admirable things for the observer--excellent for drawing the veil from men's motives and actions.
But for the trained reasoner to admit such intrusions into his own delicate and finely adjusted temperament was to introduce a distracting factor which might throw a doubt upon all his mental results.
Grit in a sensitive instrument, or a crack in one of his own high-power lenses, would not be more disturbing than a strong emotion in a nature such as his.
And yet there was but one woman to him, and that woman was the late Irene Adler, of dubious and questionable memory.
I had seen little of Holmes lately.
My marriage had drifted us away from each other.
My own complete happiness, and the home- centred interests which rise up around the man who first finds himself master of his own establishment, were sufficient to absorb all my attention, while Holmes, who
loathed every form of society with his whole Bohemian soul, remained in our
lodgings in Baker Street, buried among his old books, and alternating from week to week between cocaine and ambition, the drowsiness of the drug, and the fierce energy of his own keen nature.
He was still, as ever, deeply attracted by the study of crime, and occupied his immense faculties and extraordinary powers of observation in following out those clues, and clearing up those mysteries which had been abandoned as hopeless by the official police.
From time to time I heard some vague account of his doings: of his summons to
Odessa in the case of the Trepoff murder, of his clearing up of the singular tragedy of the Atkinson brothers at Trincomalee, and finally of the mission which he had accomplished so delicately and successfully for the reigning family of Holland.
Beyond these signs of his activity, however, which I merely shared with all the readers of the daily press, I knew little of my former friend and companion.
One night--it was on the twentieth of March, 1888--I was returning from a journey to a patient (for I had now returned to civil practice), when my way led me through
Baker Street.
As I passed the well-remembered door, which must always be associated in my mind with my wooing, and with the dark incidents of the Study in Scarlet, I was seized with a keen desire to see Holmes again, and to know how he was employing his extraordinary powers.
His rooms were brilliantly lit, and, even as I looked up, I saw his tall, spare figure pass twice in a dark silhouette against the blind.
He was pacing the room swiftly, eagerly, with his head sunk upon his chest and his hands clasped behind him.
To me, who knew his every mood and habit, his attitude and manner told their own story.
He was at work again.
He had risen out of his drug-created dreams and was hot upon the scent of some new problem.
I rang the bell and was shown up to the chamber which had formerly been in part my own.
His manner was not effusive.
It seldom was; but he was glad, I think, to see me.
With hardly a word spoken, but with a kindly eye, he waved me to an armchair, threw across his case of cigars, and indicated a spirit case and a gasogene in the corner.
Then he stood before the fire and looked me over in his singular introspective fashion.
"Wedlock suits you," he remarked.
"I think, Watson, that you have put on seven and a half pounds since I saw you."
"Seven!" I answered.
"Indeed, I should have thought a little more.
Just a trifle more, I fancy, Watson.
You did not tell me that you intended to go into harness."
"Then, how do you know?"
"I see it, I deduce it.
How do I know that you have been getting yourself very wet lately, and that you have a most clumsy and careless servant girl?" "My dear Holmes," said I, "this is too much.
You would certainly have been burned, had you lived a few centuries ago.
It is true that I had a country walk on Thursday and came home in a dreadful mess, but as I have changed my clothes I can't imagine how you deduce it.
As to Mary Jane, she is incorrigible, and my wife has given her notice, but there, again, I fail to see how you work it out."
He chuckled to himself and rubbed his long, nervous hands together.
"It is simplicity itself," said he; "my eyes tell me that on the inside of your left shoe, just where the firelight strikes it, the leather is scored by six almost parallel cuts.
Obviously they have been caused by someone who has very carelessly scraped round the edges of the sole in order to remove crusted mud from it.
Hence, you see, my double deduction that you had been out in vile weather, and that you had a particularly malignant boot- slitting specimen of the London slavey.
As to your practice, if a gentleman walks into my rooms smelling of iodoform, with a black mark of nitrate of silver upon his right forefinger, and a bulge on the right side of his top-hat to show where he has secreted his stethoscope, I must be dull, indeed, if I do not pronounce him to be an active member of the medical profession."
I could not help laughing at the ease with which he explained his process of deduction.
"When I hear you give your reasons," I remarked, "the thing always appears to me to be so ridiculously simple that I could easily do it myself, though at each successive instance of your reasoning I am baffled until you explain your process.
And yet I believe that my eyes are as good as yours."
"Quite so," he answered, lighting a cigarette, and throwing himself down into an armchair.
"You see, but you do not observe.
The distinction is clear.
For example, you have frequently seen the steps which lead up from the hall to this room." "Frequently."
"How often?"
"Well, some hundreds of times." "Then how many are there?"
"How many?
I don't know."
"Quite so!
You have not observed.
And yet you have seen.
That is just my point.
Now, I know that there are seventeen steps, because I have both seen and observed.
By-the-way, since you are interested in these little problems, and since you are good enough to chronicle one or two of my trifling experiences, you may be interested in this."
He threw over a sheet of thick, pink-tinted note-paper which had been lying open upon the table.
"It came by the last post," said he.
"Read it aloud."
The note was undated, and without either signature or address.
"There will call upon you to-night, at a quarter to eight o'clock," it said, "a gentleman who desires to consult you upon a matter of the very deepest moment.
Your recent services to one of the royal houses of Europe have shown that you are one who may safely be trusted with matters which are of an importance which can hardly be exaggerated.
This account of you we have from all quarters received.
Be in your chamber then at that hour, and do not take it amiss if your visitor wear a mask."
"This is indeed a mystery," I remarked.
"What do you imagine that it means?"
It is a capital mistake to theorize before one has data.
Insensibly one begins to twist facts to suit theories, instead of theories to suit facts.
But the note itself.
What do you deduce from it?"
I carefully examined the writing, and the paper upon which it was written.
"The man who wrote it was presumably well to do," I remarked, endeavouring to imitate my companion's processes.
"Such paper could not be bought under half a crown a packet.
It is peculiarly strong and stiff." "Peculiar--that is the very word," said
Holmes.
"It is not an English paper at all.
Hold it up to the light."
I did so, and saw a large "E" with a small "g," a "P," and a large "G" with a small
"t" woven into the texture of the paper.
"What do you make of that?" asked Holmes.
"The name of the maker, no doubt; or his monogram, rather." "Not at all.
The 'G' with the small 't' stands for 'Gesellschaft,' which is the German for
'Company.' It is a customary contraction like our
'Co.'
'P,' of course, stands for 'Papier.'
Now for the 'Eg.'
Let us glance at our Continental Gazetteer."
He took down a heavy brown volume from his shelves.
"Eglow, Eglonitz--here we are, Egria.
It is in a German-speaking country--in
Bohemia, not far from Carlsbad.
'Remarkable as being the scene of the death of Wallenstein, and for its numerous glass- factories and paper-mills.'
Ha, ha, my boy, what do you make of that?"
His eyes sparkled, and he sent up a great blue triumphant cloud from his cigarette.
"The paper was made in Bohemia," I said.
"Precisely.
And the man who wrote the note is a German.
Do you note the peculiar construction of the sentence--'This account of you we have from all quarters received.'
A Frenchman or Russian could not have written that.
It is the German who is so uncourteous to his verbs.
It only remains, therefore, to discover what is wanted by this German who writes upon Bohemian paper and prefers wearing a mask to showing his face.
And here he comes, if I am not mistaken, to resolve all our doubts."
As he spoke there was the sharp sound of horses' hoofs and grating wheels against the curb, followed by a sharp pull at the bell.
Holmes whistled.
"A pair, by the sound," said he.
"Yes," he continued, glancing out of the window.
"A nice little brougham and a pair of beauties.
There's money in this case, Watson, if there is nothing else."
"I think that I had better go, Holmes."
"Not a bit, Doctor.
Stay where you are.
I am lost without my Boswell.
And this promises to be interesting.
It would be a pity to miss it."
"But your client--"
"Never mind him.
I may want your help, and so may he.
Here he comes.
Sit down in that armchair, Doctor, and give us your best attention." Then there was a loud and authoritative tap.
"Come in!" said Holmes.
A man entered who could hardly have been less than six feet six inches in height, with the chest and limbs of a Hercules.
His dress was rich with a richness which would, in England, be looked upon as akin to bad taste.
Heavy bands of astrakhan were slashed across the sleeves and fronts of his double-breasted coat, while the deep blue cloak which was thrown over his shoulders was lined with flame-coloured silk and secured at the neck with a brooch which consisted of a single flaming beryl.
Boots which extended halfway up his calves, and which were trimmed at the tops with rich brown fur, completed the impression of barbaric opulence which was suggested by his whole appearance.
He carried a broad-brimmed hat in his hand, while he wore across the upper part of his face, extending down past the cheekbones, a black vizard mask, which he had apparently adjusted that very moment, for his hand was still raised to it as he entered.
From the lower part of the face he appeared to be a man of strong character, with a thick, hanging lip, and a long, straight chin suggestive of resolution pushed to the
length of obstinacy.
"You had my note?" he asked with a deep harsh voice and a strongly marked German accent.
"I told you that I would call."
He looked from one to the other of us, as if uncertain which to address.
"Pray take a seat," said Holmes.
"This is my friend and colleague, Dr. Watson, who is occasionally good enough to help me in my cases.
Whom have I the honour to address?"
"You may address me as the Count Von Kramm, a Bohemian nobleman.
I understand that this gentleman, your friend, is a man of honour and discretion, whom I may trust with a matter of the most extreme importance.
If not, I should much prefer to communicate with you alone."
I rose to go, but Holmes caught me by the wrist and pushed me back into my chair.
"It is both, or none," said he.
"You may say before this gentleman anything which you may say to me."
The Count shrugged his broad shoulders.
"Then I must begin," said he, "by binding you both to absolute secrecy for two years; at the end of that time the matter will be of no importance.
At present it is not too much to say that it is of such weight it may have an influence upon European history." "I promise," said Holmes.
"And I."
"You will excuse this mask," continued our strange visitor.
"The august person who employs me wishes his agent to be unknown to you, and I may confess at once that the title by which I have just called myself is not exactly my own."
"I was aware of it," said Holmes dryly.
"The circumstances are of great delicacy, and every precaution has to be taken to quench what might grow to be an immense scandal and seriously compromise one of the reigning families of Europe.
To speak plainly, the matter implicates the great House of Ormstein, hereditary kings of Bohemia."
"I was also aware of that," murmured Holmes, settling himself down in his armchair and closing his eyes.
Our visitor glanced with some apparent surprise at the languid, lounging figure of the man who had been no doubt depicted to him as the most incisive reasoner and most energetic agent in Europe.
Holmes slowly reopened his eyes and looked impatiently at his gigantic client.
"If your Majesty would condescend to state your case," he remarked, "I should be better able to advise you."
The man sprang from his chair and paced up and down the room in uncontrollable agitation.
Then, with a gesture of desperation, he tore the mask from his face and hurled it upon the ground.
"You are right," he cried; "I am the King.
Why should I attempt to conceal it?"
"Why, indeed?" murmured Holmes.
"Your Majesty had not spoken before I was aware that I was addressing Wilhelm
Gottsreich Sigismond von Ormstein, Grand Duke of Cassel-Felstein, and hereditary
King of Bohemia."
"But you can understand," said our strange visitor, sitting down once more and passing his hand over his high white forehead, "you can understand that I am not accustomed to doing such business in my own person.
Yet the matter was so delicate that I could not confide it to an agent without putting myself in his power.
I have come incognito from Prague for the purpose of consulting you."
"Then, pray consult," said Holmes, shutting his eyes once more.
"The facts are briefly these: Some five years ago, during a lengthy visit to
Warsaw, I made the acquaintance of the well-known adventuress, Irene Adler.
The name is no doubt familiar to you."
"Kindly look her up in my index, Doctor," murmured Holmes without opening his eyes.
For many years he had adopted a system of docketing all paragraphs concerning men and things, so that it was difficult to name a subject or a person on which he could not at once furnish information.
In this case I found her biography sandwiched in between that of a Hebrew rabbi and that of a staff-commander who had written a monograph upon the deep-sea fishes.
"Let me see!" said Holmes.
"Hum!
Born in New Jersey in the year 1858.
Contralto--hum!
La Scala, hum!
Prima donna Imperial Opera of Warsaw--yes!
Retired from operatic stage--ha!
Living in London--quite so!
Your Majesty, as I understand, became entangled with this young person, wrote her some compromising letters, and is now desirous of getting those letters back."
"Precisely so.
But how--" "Was there a secret marriage?"
"None." "No legal papers or certificates?"
"None."
"Then I fail to follow your Majesty.
If this young person should produce her letters for blackmailing or other purposes, how is she to prove their authenticity?"
"There is the writing."
"Pooh, pooh!
Forgery."
"My private note-paper." "Stolen."
"My own seal."
"Imitated." "My photograph."
"Bought." "We were both in the photograph."
Your Majesty has indeed committed an indiscretion."
"You have compromised yourself seriously."
"I was only Crown Prince then.
I was young.
I am but thirty now." "It must be recovered."
"We have tried and failed."
"Your Majesty must pay.
It must be bought."
"She will not sell." "Stolen, then."
"Five attempts have been made.
Twice burglars in my pay ransacked her house.
Once we diverted her luggage when she travelled.
Twice she has been waylaid.
There has been no result." "No sign of it?"
"Absolutely none." Holmes laughed.
"It is quite a pretty little problem," said he.
"But a very serious one to me," returned the King reproachfully.
"Very, indeed.
And what does she propose to do with the photograph?"
"To ruin me." "But how?"
"I am about to be married."
"So I have heard." You may know the strict principles of her family.
A shadow of a doubt as to my conduct would bring the matter to an end." "And Irene Adler?"
"Threatens to send them the photograph.
And she will do it.
I know that she will do it.
You do not know her, but she has a soul of steel.
She has the face of the most beautiful of women, and the mind of the most resolute of men.
Rather than I should marry another woman, there are no lengths to which she would not go--none." "You are sure that she has not sent it yet?"
"I am sure." "And why?"
"Because she has said that she would send it on the day when the betrothal was publicly proclaimed.
That will be next Monday." "Oh, then we have three days yet," said
Holmes with a yawn.
"That is very fortunate, as I have one or two matters of importance to look into just at present.
Your Majesty will, of course, stay in
London for the present?"
"Certainly.
You will find me at the Langham under the name of the Count Von Kramm." "Then I shall drop you a line to let you know how we progress."
"Pray do so.
I shall be all anxiety."
"Then, as to money?" "You have carte blanche."
"Absolutely?"
"I tell you that I would give one of the provinces of my kingdom to have that photograph."
"And for present expenses?"
The King took a heavy chamois leather bag from under his cloak and laid it on the table.
"There are three hundred pounds in gold and seven hundred in notes," he said.
Holmes scribbled a receipt upon a sheet of his note-book and handed it to him.
"And Mademoiselle's address?" he asked.
"Is Briony Lodge, Serpentine Avenue, St.
John's Wood."
Holmes took a note of it.
"One other question," said he.
"Was the photograph a cabinet?" "It was."
"Then, good-night, your Majesty, and I trust that we shall soon have some good news for you.
And good-night, Watson," he added, as the wheels of the royal brougham rolled down the street.
"If you will be good enough to call to- morrow afternoon at three o'clock I should like to chat this little matter over with you."
Il.
At three o'clock precisely I was at Baker
Street, but Holmes had not yet returned.
The landlady informed me that he had left the house shortly after eight o'clock in the morning.
I sat down beside the fire, however, with the intention of awaiting him, however long he might be.
I was already deeply interested in his inquiry, for, though it was surrounded by none of the grim and strange features which were associated with the two crimes which I have already recorded, still, the nature of the case and the exalted station of his client gave it a character of its own.
Indeed, apart from the nature of the investigation which my friend had on hand, there was something in his masterly grasp of a situation, and his keen, incisive reasoning, which made it a pleasure to me to study his system of work, and to follow the quick, subtle methods by which he disentangled the most inextricable mysteries.
So accustomed was I to his invariable success that the very possibility of his failing had ceased to enter into my head.
It was close upon four before the door opened, and a drunken-looking groom, ill- kempt and side-whiskered, with an inflamed face and disreputable clothes, walked into the room.
Accustomed as I was to my friend's amazing powers in the use of disguises, I had to look three times before I was certain that it was indeed he.
With a nod he vanished into the bedroom, whence he emerged in five minutes tweed- suited and respectable, as of old.
Putting his hands into his pockets, he stretched out his legs in front of the fire and laughed heartily for some minutes.
"Well, really!" he cried, and then he choked and laughed again until he was obliged to lie back, limp and helpless, in the chair.
"What is it?"
"It's quite too funny.
I am sure you could never guess how I employed my morning, or what I ended by doing."
"I can't imagine.
I suppose that you have been watching the habits, and perhaps the house, of Miss
"Quite so; but the sequel was rather unusual.
I will tell you, however.
I left the house a little after eight o'clock this morning in the character of a groom out of work.
There is a wonderful sympathy and freemasonry among horsey men.
Be one of them, and you will know all that there is to know.
I soon found Briony Lodge.
It is a bijou villa, with a garden at the back, but built out in front right up to the road, two stories.
Chubb lock to the door.
Large sitting-room on the right side, well furnished, with long windows almost to the floor, and those preposterous English window fasteners which a child could open.
Behind there was nothing remarkable, save that the passage window could be reached from the top of the coach-house.
I walked round it and examined it closely from every point of view, but without noting anything else of interest.
"I then lounged down the street and found, as I expected, that there was a mews in a
lane which runs down by one wall of the garden.
I lent the ostlers a hand in rubbing down their horses, and received in exchange twopence, a glass of half and half, two fills of shag tobacco, and as much information as I could desire about Miss
Adler, to say nothing of half a dozen other people in the neighbourhood in whom I was not in the least interested, but whose biographies I was compelled to listen to."
"And what of Irene Adler?"
I asked.
"Oh, she has turned all the men's heads down in that part.
She is the daintiest thing under a bonnet on this planet.
So say the Serpentine-mews, to a man.
She lives quietly, sings at concerts, drives out at five every day, and returns at seven sharp for dinner.
Seldom goes out at other times, except when she sings.
Has only one male visitor, but a good deal of him.
He is dark, handsome, and dashing, never calls less than once a day, and often twice.
He is a Mr. Godfrey Norton, of the Inner
Temple.
See the advantages of a cabman as a confidant.
They had driven him home a dozen times from Serpentine-mews, and knew all about him.
When I had listened to all they had to tell, I began to walk up and down near
Briony Lodge once more, and to think over my plan of campaign.
"This Godfrey Norton was evidently an important factor in the matter.
He was a lawyer.
That sounded ominous.
What was the relation between them, and what the object of his repeated visits?
Was she his client, his friend, or his mistress?
If the former, she had probably transferred the photograph to his keeping.
If the latter, it was less likely.
On the issue of this question depended whether I should continue my work at Briony
Lodge, or turn my attention to the gentleman's chambers in the Temple.
It was a delicate point, and it widened the field of my inquiry.
I fear that I bore you with these details, but I have to let you see my little difficulties, if you are to understand the situation."
"I am following you closely," I answered.
"I was still balancing the matter in my mind when a hansom cab drove up to Briony
Lodge, and a gentleman sprang out.
He was a remarkably handsome man, dark, aquiline, and moustached--evidently the man of whom I had heard.
He appeared to be in a great hurry, shouted to the cabman to wait, and brushed past the maid who opened the door with the air of a man who was thoroughly at home.
"He was in the house about half an hour, and I could catch glimpses of him in the windows of the sitting-room, pacing up and down, talking excitedly, and waving his arms.
Of her I could see nothing. Presently he emerged, looking even more flurried than before.
As he stepped up to the cab, he pulled a gold watch from his pocket and looked at it earnestly, 'Drive like the devil,' he shouted, 'first to Gross &amp; Hankey's in
Regent Street, and then to the Church of St. Monica in the Edgeware Road.
Half a guinea if you do it in twenty minutes!'
"Away they went, and I was just wondering whether I should not do well to follow them when up the lane came a neat little landau, the coachman with his coat only half- buttoned, and his tie under his ear, while all the tags of his harness were sticking out of the buckles.
It hadn't pulled up before she shot out of the hall door and into it.
I only caught a glimpse of her at the moment, but she was a lovely woman, with a face that a man might die for. "'The Church of St. Monica, John,' she cried, 'and half a sovereign if you reach it in twenty minutes.' "This was quite too good to lose, Watson.
I was just balancing whether I should run for it, or whether I should perch behind her landau when a cab came through the street.
The driver looked twice at such a shabby fare, but I jumped in before he could object.
'The Church of St. Monica,' said I, 'and half a sovereign if you reach it in twenty minutes.'
It was twenty-five minutes to twelve, and of course it was clear enough what was in the wind.
"My cabby drove fast.
I don't think I ever drove faster, but the others were there before us.
The cab and the landau with their steaming horses were in front of the door when I arrived.
I paid the man and hurried into the church.
There was not a soul there save the two whom I had followed and a surpliced clergyman, who seemed to be expostulating with them.
They were all three standing in a knot in front of the altar.
I lounged up the side aisle like any other idler who has dropped into a church.
Suddenly, to my surprise, the three at the altar faced round to me, and Godfrey Norton came running as hard as he could towards me. "'Thank God,' he cried.
'You'll do.
Come!
Come!' "'What then?'
I asked. "'Come, man, come, only three minutes, or it won't be legal.'
"I was half-dragged up to the altar, and before I knew where I was I found myself mumbling responses which were whispered in my ear, and vouching for things of which I knew nothing, and generally assisting in the secure tying up of Irene Adler, spinster, to Godfrey Norton, bachelor.
It was all done in an instant, and there was the gentleman thanking me on the one side and the lady on the other, while the clergyman beamed on me in front.
It was the most preposterous position in which I ever found myself in my life, and it was the thought of it that started me laughing just now.
It seems that there had been some informality about their license, that the clergyman absolutely refused to marry them without a witness of some sort, and that my lucky appearance saved the bridegroom from having to sally out into the streets in search of a best man.
The bride gave me a sovereign, and I mean to wear it on my watch-chain in memory of the occasion."
"This is a very unexpected turn of affairs," said I; "and what then?"
"Well, I found my plans very seriously menaced.
It looked as if the pair might take an immediate departure, and so necessitate very prompt and energetic measures on my part.
At the church door, however, they separated, he driving back to the Temple, and she to her own house.
'I shall drive out in the park at five as usual,' she said as she left him.
I heard no more.
They drove away in different directions, and I went off to make my own arrangements."
"Which are?"
"Some cold beef and a glass of beer," he answered, ringing the bell.
"I have been too busy to think of food, and I am likely to be busier still this evening.
By the way, Doctor, I shall want your co- operation."
"I shall be delighted." "You don't mind breaking the law?"
"Not in the least."
"Nor running a chance of arrest?" "Not in a good cause."
"Oh, the cause is excellent!" "Then I am your man."
"I was sure that I might rely on you."
"But what is it you wish?" "When Mrs. Turner has brought in the tray I will make it clear to you.
Now," he said as he turned hungrily on the simple fare that our landlady had provided,
"I must discuss it while I eat, for I have not much time.
It is nearly five now.
In two hours we must be on the scene of action.
Miss Irene, or Madame, rather, returns from her drive at seven.
We must be at Briony Lodge to meet her."
"And what then?" "You must leave that to me.
I have already arranged what is to occur. There is only one point on which I must insist.
You must not interfere, come what may.
You understand?"
"I am to be neutral?" "To do nothing whatever.
There will probably be some small unpleasantness.
It will end in my being conveyed into the house.
Four or five minutes afterwards the sitting-room window will open.
You are to station yourself close to that open window."
"Yes."
"You are to watch me, for I will be visible to you."
"Yes."
"And when I raise my hand--so--you will throw into the room what I give you to throw, and will, at the same time, raise the cry of fire.
You quite follow me?"
"Entirely." "It is nothing very formidable," he said, taking a long cigar-shaped roll from his pocket.
"It is an ordinary plumber's smoke-rocket, fitted with a cap at either end to make it self-lighting.
Your task is confined to that.
When you raise your cry of fire, it will be taken up by quite a number of people.
You may then walk to the end of the street, and I will rejoin you in ten minutes.
I hope that I have made myself clear?"
"I am to remain neutral, to get near the window, to watch you, and at the signal to throw in this object, then to raise the cry of fire, and to wait you at the corner of the street."
"Precisely." "Then you may entirely rely on me."
I think, perhaps, it is almost time that I prepare for the new role I have to play."
He disappeared into his bedroom and returned in a few minutes in the character of an amiable and simple-minded Nonconformist clergyman.
His broad black hat, his baggy trousers, his white tie, his sympathetic smile, and general look of peering and benevolent curiosity were such as Mr. John Hare alone could have equalled.
It was not merely that Holmes changed his costume.
His expression, his manner, his very soul seemed to vary with every fresh part that he assumed.
The stage lost a fine actor, even as science lost an acute reasoner, when he became a specialist in crime.
It was a quarter past six when we left Baker Street, and it still wanted ten minutes to the hour when we found ourselves in Serpentine Avenue.
It was already dusk, and the lamps were just being lighted as we paced up and down in front of Briony Lodge, waiting for the coming of its occupant.
The house was just such as I had pictured it from Sherlock Holmes' succinct description, but the locality appeared to be less private than I expected.
On the contrary, for a small street in a quiet neighbourhood, it was remarkably animated.
There was a group of shabbily dressed men smoking and laughing in a corner, a scissors-grinder with his wheel, two guardsmen who were flirting with a nurse- girl, and several well-dressed young men who were lounging up and down with cigars in their mouths.
"You see," remarked Holmes, as we paced to and fro in front of the house, "this marriage rather simplifies matters.
The chances are that she would be as averse to its being seen by Mr. Godfrey Norton, as our client is to its coming to the eyes of his princess.
Now the question is, Where are we to find the photograph?"
"Where, indeed?" "It is most unlikely that she carries it about with her.
It is cabinet size.
She knows that the King is capable of having her waylaid and searched.
Two attempts of the sort have already been made.
We may take it, then, that she does not carry it about with her."
"Where, then?"
"Her banker or her lawyer.
There is that double possibility.
But I am inclined to think neither.
Women are naturally secretive, and they like to do their own secreting.
Why should she hand it over to anyone else?
She could trust her own guardianship, but she could not tell what indirect or political influence might be brought to bear upon a business man.
Besides, remember that she had resolved to use it within a few days.
It must be where she can lay her hands upon it.
It must be in her own house."
"But it has twice been burgled." "Pshaw!
They did not know how to look." "But how will you look?"
"I will not look."
"What then?" "I will get her to show me."
"But she will refuse." "She will not be able to.
But I hear the rumble of wheels.
It is her carriage.
Now carry out my orders to the letter."
As he spoke the gleam of the side-lights of a carriage came round the curve of the avenue.
It was a smart little landau which rattled up to the door of Briony Lodge.
As it pulled up, one of the loafing men at the corner dashed forward to open the door in the hope of earning a copper, but was elbowed away by another loafer, who had rushed up with the same intention.
A fierce quarrel broke out, which was increased by the two guardsmen, who took sides with one of the loungers, and by the scissors-grinder, who was equally hot upon the other side.
A blow was struck, and in an instant the lady, who had stepped from her carriage, was the centre of a little knot of flushed and struggling men, who struck savagely at each other with their fists and sticks.
Holmes dashed into the crowd to protect the lady; but just as he reached her he gave a cry and dropped to the ground, with the blood running freely down his face.
At his fall the guardsmen took to their heels in one direction and the loungers in the other, while a number of better-dressed people, who had watched the scuffle without taking part in it, crowded in to help the lady and to attend to the injured man.
Irene Adler, as I will still call her, had hurried up the steps; but she stood at the top with her superb figure outlined against the lights of the hall, looking back into the street.
"Is the poor gentleman much hurt?" she asked.
"He is dead," cried several voices.
"No, no, there's life in him!" shouted another.
"But he'll be gone before you can get him to hospital."
"He's a brave fellow," said a woman.
"They would have had the lady's purse and watch if it hadn't been for him.
They were a gang, and a rough one, too.
Ah, he's breathing now."
"He can't lie in the street.
May we bring him in, marm?"
"Surely.
Bring him into the sitting-room.
There is a comfortable sofa.
This way, please!"
Slowly and solemnly he was borne into Briony Lodge and laid out in the principal room, while I still observed the proceedings from my post by the window.
The lamps had been lit, but the blinds had not been drawn, so that I could see Holmes as he lay upon the couch.
I do not know whether he was seized with compunction at that moment for the part he was playing, but I know that I never felt more heartily ashamed of myself in my life than when I saw the beautiful creature against whom I was conspiring, or the grace and kindliness with which she waited upon the injured man.
And yet it would be the blackest treachery to Holmes to draw back now from the part which he had intrusted to me.
I hardened my heart, and took the smoke- rocket from under my ulster.
After all, I thought, we are not injuring her.
We are but preventing her from injuring another.
Holmes had sat up upon the couch, and I saw him motion like a man who is in need of air.
A maid rushed across and threw open the window.
At the same instant I saw him raise his hand and at the signal I tossed my rocket into the room with a cry of "Fire!"
The word was no sooner out of my mouth than the whole crowd of spectators, well dressed and ill--gentlemen, ostlers, and servant- maids--joined in a general shriek of
"Fire!"
Thick clouds of smoke curled through the room and out at the open window.
I caught a glimpse of rushing figures, and a moment later the voice of Holmes from within assuring them that it was a false alarm.
Slipping through the shouting crowd I made my way to the corner of the street, and in ten minutes was rejoiced to find my friend's arm in mine, and to get away from the scene of uproar.
He walked swiftly and in silence for some few minutes until we had turned down one of the quiet streets which lead towards the Edgeware Road.
"You did it very nicely, Doctor," he remarked.
"Nothing could have been better.
It is all right."
"You have the photograph?"
"I know where it is." "And how did you find out?"
"She showed me, as I told you she would." "I am still in the dark."
"I do not wish to make a mystery," said he, laughing.
"The matter was perfectly simple.
You, of course, saw that everyone in the street was an accomplice.
They were all engaged for the evening." "I guessed as much."
"Then, when the row broke out, I had a little moist red paint in the palm of my hand.
I rushed forward, fell down, clapped my hand to my face, and became a piteous spectacle.
It is an old trick."
"That also I could fathom."
"Then they carried me in. She was bound to have me in.
What else could she do?
And into her sitting-room, which was the very room which I suspected.
It lay between that and her bedroom, and I was determined to see which.
They laid me on a couch, I motioned for air, they were compelled to open the window, and you had your chance."
"How did that help you?" "It was all-important.
When a woman thinks that her house is on fire, her instinct is at once to rush to the thing which she values most.
It is a perfectly overpowering impulse, and I have more than once taken advantage of it.
In the case of the Darlington substitution scandal it was of use to me, and also in the Arnsworth Castle business.
A married woman grabs at her baby; an unmarried one reaches for her jewel-box.
Now it was clear to me that our lady of to- day had nothing in the house more precious to her than what we are in quest of.
She would rush to secure it.
The alarm of fire was admirably done.
The smoke and shouting were enough to shake nerves of steel.
She responded beautifully.
The photograph is in a recess behind a sliding panel just above the right bell- pull.
She was there in an instant, and I caught a glimpse of it as she half-drew it out.
When I cried out that it was a false alarm, she replaced it, glanced at the rocket, rushed from the room, and I have not seen her since.
I rose, and, making my excuses, escaped from the house.
I hesitated whether to attempt to secure the photograph at once; but the coachman had come in, and as he was watching me narrowly it seemed safer to wait.
A little over-precipitance may ruin all."
"And now?" I asked.
"Our quest is practically finished.
I shall call with the King to-morrow, and with you, if you care to come with us.
We will be shown into the sitting-room to wait for the lady, but it is probable that when she comes she may find neither us nor the photograph.
It might be a satisfaction to his Majesty to regain it with his own hands."
"And when will you call?" "At eight in the morning.
She will not be up, so that we shall have a clear field.
Besides, we must be prompt, for this marriage may mean a complete change in her life and habits.
I must wire to the King without delay."
We had reached Baker Street and had stopped at the door. He was searching his pockets for the key when someone passing said:
"Good-night, Mister Sherlock Holmes." There were several people on the pavement at the time, but the greeting appeared to come from a slim youth in an ulster who had hurried by.
"I've heard that voice before," said Holmes, staring down the dimly lit street.
"Now, I wonder who the deuce that could have been."
IIl.
I slept at Baker Street that night, and we were engaged upon our toast and coffee in the morning when the King of Bohemia rushed into the room.
"You have really got it!" he cried, grasping Sherlock Holmes by either shoulder and looking eagerly into his face.
"Not yet."
"But you have hopes?"
"I have hopes." "Then, come.
I am all impatience to be gone." "We must have a cab."
"No, my brougham is waiting."
"Then that will simplify matters." We descended and started off once more for
Briony Lodge.
"Irene Adler is married," remarked Holmes.
"Married!
When?" "Yesterday."
"But to whom?" "To an English lawyer named Norton."
"But she could not love him."
"I am in hopes that she does." "And why in hopes?"
"Because it would spare your Majesty all fear of future annoyance.
If the lady loves her husband, she does not love your Majesty.
If she does not love your Majesty, there is no reason why she should interfere with your Majesty's plan."
"It is true.
And yet--Well!
I wish she had been of my own station!
What a queen she would have made!"
He relapsed into a moody silence, which was not broken until we drew up in Serpentine
The door of Briony Lodge was open, and an elderly woman stood upon the steps.
She watched us with a sardonic eye as we stepped from the brougham.
"Mr. Sherlock Holmes, I believe?" said she.
"I am Mr. Holmes," answered my companion, looking at her with a questioning and rather startled gaze.
"Indeed!
My mistress told me that you were likely to call.
She left this morning with her husband by the 5:15 train from Charing Cross for the
Continent."
"What!" Sherlock Holmes staggered back, white with chagrin and surprise.
"Do you mean that she has left England?"
"Never to return."
"And the papers?" asked the King hoarsely.
"All is lost."
"We shall see."
He pushed past the servant and rushed into the drawing-room, followed by the King and myself.
The furniture was scattered about in every direction, with dismantled shelves and open drawers, as if the lady had hurriedly ransacked them before her flight.
Holmes rushed at the bell-pull, tore back a small sliding shutter, and, plunging in his hand, pulled out a photograph and a letter.
The photograph was of Irene Adler herself in evening dress, the letter was superscribed to "Sherlock Holmes, Esq.
To be left till called for."
My friend tore it open and we all three read it together.
It was dated at midnight of the preceding night and ran in this way:
"MY DEAR MR. SHERLOCK HOLMES,--You really did it very well.
You took me in completely. Until after the alarm of fire, I had not a suspicion.
But then, when I found how I had betrayed myself, I began to think.
I had been warned against you months ago.
I had been told that if the King employed an agent it would certainly be you.
And your address had been given me. Yet, with all this, you made me reveal what you wanted to know.
Even after I became suspicious, I found it hard to think evil of such a dear, kind old clergyman.
But, you know, I have been trained as an actress myself.
I often take advantage of the freedom which it gives.
I sent John, the coachman, to watch you, ran up stairs, got into my walking-clothes, as I call them, and came down just as you departed.
"Well, I followed you to your door, and so made sure that I was really an object of interest to the celebrated Mr. Sherlock Holmes.
Then I, rather imprudently, wished you good-night, and started for the Temple to see my husband.
"We both thought the best resource was flight, when pursued by so formidable an antagonist; so you will find the nest empty when you call to-morrow.
As to the photograph, your client may rest in peace.
I love and am loved by a better man than he.
The King may do what he will without hindrance from one whom he has cruelly wronged.
I keep it only to safeguard myself, and to preserve a weapon which will always secure me from any steps which he might take in the future.
I leave a photograph which he might care to possess; and I remain, dear Mr. Sherlock
Holmes, "Very truly yours, "IRENE NORTON, n√©e
ADLER."
"What a woman--oh, what a woman!" cried the King of Bohemia, when we had all three read this epistle.
"Did I not tell you how quick and resolute she was?
"From what I have seen of the lady she seems indeed to be on a very different level to your Majesty," said Holmes coldly.
"I am sorry that I have not been able to bring your Majesty's business to a more successful conclusion." "On the contrary, my dear sir," cried the
King; "nothing could be more successful.
The photograph is now as safe as if it were in the fire."
"I am immensely indebted to you.
Pray tell me in what way I can reward you.
This ring--" He slipped an emerald snake ring from his finger and held it out upon the palm of his hand.
"Your Majesty has something which I should value even more highly," said Holmes.
"You have but to name it." "This photograph!"
The King stared at him in amazement.
"Irene's photograph!" he cried.
"Certainly, if you wish it."
"I thank your Majesty.
Then there is no more to be done in the matter.
I have the honour to wish you a very good- morning."
He bowed, and, turning away without observing the hand which the King had stretched out to him, he set off in my company for his chambers.
And that was how a great scandal threatened to affect the kingdom of Bohemia, and how the best plans of Mr. Sherlock Holmes were beaten by a woman's wit.
He used to make merry over the cleverness of women, but I have not heard him do it of late.
And when he speaks of Irene Adler, or when he refers to her photograph, it is always under the honourable title of the woman. &gt;
THE ADVENTURES OF SHERLOCK HOLMES by SlR ARTHUR CONAN DOYLE
ADVENTURE Il.
THE RED-HEADED LEAGUE
I had called upon my friend, Mr. Sherlock Holmes, one day in the autumn of last year and found him in deep conversation with a very stout, florid-faced, elderly gentleman with fiery red hair.
With an apology for my intrusion, I was about to withdraw when Holmes pulled me abruptly into the room and closed the door behind me.
"You could not possibly have come at a better time, my dear Watson," he said cordially.
"I was afraid that you were engaged."
"So I am.
Very much so." "Then I can wait in the next room."
"Not at all.
This gentleman, Mr. Wilson, has been my partner and helper in many of my most successful cases, and I have no doubt that he will be of the utmost use to me in yours also."
The stout gentleman half rose from his chair and gave a bob of greeting, with a quick little questioning glance from his small fat-encircled eyes.
"Try the settee," said Holmes, relapsing into his armchair and putting his fingertips together, as was his custom when in judicial moods.
"I know, my dear Watson, that you share my love of all that is bizarre and outside the conventions and humdrum routine of everyday life.
You have shown your relish for it by the enthusiasm which has prompted you to chronicle, and, if you will excuse my saying so, somewhat to embellish so many of my own little adventures."
"Your cases have indeed been of the greatest interest to me," I observed.
"You will remember that I remarked the other day, just before we went into the very simple problem presented by Miss Mary Sutherland, that for strange effects and extraordinary combinations we must go to life itself, which is always far more daring than any effort of the imagination."
"A proposition which I took the liberty of doubting."
"You did, Doctor, but none the less you must come round to my view, for otherwise I shall keep on piling fact upon fact on you until your reason breaks down under them and acknowledges me to be right.
Now, Mr. Jabez Wilson here has been good enough to call upon me this morning, and to begin a narrative which promises to be one of the most singular which I have listened to for some time.
You have heard me remark that the strangest and most unique things are very often connected not with the larger but with the smaller crimes, and occasionally, indeed, where there is room for doubt whether any positive crime has been committed.
As far as I have heard it is impossible for me to say whether the present case is an instance of crime or not, but the course of events is certainly among the most singular that I have ever listened to.
Perhaps, Mr. Wilson, you would have the great kindness to recommence your narrative.
I ask you not merely because my friend Dr. Watson has not heard the opening part but also because the peculiar nature of the story makes me anxious to have every possible detail from your lips.
As a rule, when I have heard some slight indication of the course of events, I am able to guide myself by the thousands of other similar cases which occur to my memory.
In the present instance I am forced to admit that the facts are, to the best of my belief, unique."
The portly client puffed out his chest with an appearance of some little pride and pulled a dirty and wrinkled newspaper from the inside pocket of his greatcoat.
As he glanced down the advertisement column, with his head thrust forward and the paper flattened out upon his knee, I took a good look at the man and endeavoured, after the fashion of my companion, to read the indications which might be presented by his dress or appearance.
I did not gain very much, however, by my inspection.
Our visitor bore every mark of being an average commonplace British tradesman, obese, pompous, and slow.
He wore rather baggy grey shepherd's check trousers, a not over-clean black frock- coat, unbuttoned in the front, and a drab waistcoat with a heavy brassy Albert chain, and a square pierced bit of metal dangling down as an ornament.
A frayed top-hat and a faded brown overcoat with a wrinkled velvet collar lay upon a chair beside him.
Altogether, look as I would, there was nothing remarkable about the man save his blazing red head, and the expression of extreme chagrin and discontent upon his features.
Sherlock Holmes' quick eye took in my occupation, and he shook his head with a smile as he noticed my questioning glances.
"Beyond the obvious facts that he has at some time done manual labour, that he takes snuff, that he is a Freemason, that he has been in China, and that he has done a considerable amount of writing lately, I can deduce nothing else."
Mr. Jabez Wilson started up in his chair, with his forefinger upon the paper, but his eyes upon my companion.
"How, in the name of good-fortune, did you know all that, Mr. Holmes?" he asked.
"How did you know, for example, that I did manual labour.
It's as true as gospel, for I began as a ship's carpenter."
"Your hands, my dear sir.
Your right hand is quite a size larger than your left.
You have worked with it, and the muscles are more developed."
"Well, the snuff, then, and the Freemasonry?"
"I won't insult your intelligence by telling you how I read that, especially as, rather against the strict rules of your order, you use an arc-and-compass breastpin."
"Ah, of course, I forgot that.
But the writing?"
"What else can be indicated by that right cuff so very shiny for five inches, and the left one with the smooth patch near the elbow where you rest it upon the desk?"
"Well, but China?"
"The fish that you have tattooed immediately above your right wrist could only have been done in China.
I have made a small study of tattoo marks and have even contributed to the literature of the subject.
That trick of staining the fishes' scales of a delicate pink is quite peculiar to
China.
When, in addition, I see a Chinese coin hanging from your watch-chain, the matter becomes even more simple."
Mr. Jabez Wilson laughed heavily.
"Well, I never!" said he.
"I thought at first that you had done something clever, but I see that there was nothing in it, after all." "I begin to think, Watson," said Holmes,
"that I make a mistake in explaining.
'Omne ignotum pro magnifico,' you know, and my poor little reputation, such as it is, will suffer shipwreck if I am so candid.
Can you not find the advertisement, Mr.
Wilson?"
"Yes, I have got it now," he answered with his thick red finger planted halfway down the column.
"Here it is.
This is what began it all.
You just read it for yourself, sir."
I took the paper from him and read as follows:
"TO THE RED-HEADED LEAGUE:
On account of the bequest of the late Ezekiah Hopkins, of
Lebanon, Pennsylvania, U. S. A., there is now another vacancy open which entitles a member of the League to a salary of 4 pounds a week for purely nominal services.
All red-headed men who are sound in body and mind and above the age of twenty-one years, are eligible.
Apply in person on Monday, at eleven o'clock, to Duncan Ross, at the offices of the League, 7 Pope's Court, Fleet Street." "What on earth does this mean?"
I ejaculated after I had twice read over the extraordinary announcement.
Holmes chuckled and wriggled in his chair, as was his habit when in high spirits.
"It is a little off the beaten track, isn't it?" said he.
"And now, Mr. Wilson, off you go at scratch and tell us all about yourself, your household, and the effect which this advertisement had upon your fortunes.
You will first make a note, Doctor, of the paper and the date."
"It is The Morning Chronicle of April 27, 1890.
Just two months ago."
"Very good.
Now, Mr. Wilson?"
"Well, it is just as I have been telling you, Mr. Sherlock Holmes," said Jabez
Wilson, mopping his forehead; "I have a small pawnbroker's business at Coburg
Square, near the City.
It's not a very large affair, and of late years it has not done more than just give me a living.
I used to be able to keep two assistants, but now I only keep one; and I would have a job to pay him but that he is willing to come for half wages so as to learn the business."
"What is the name of this obliging youth?" asked Sherlock Holmes.
"His name is Vincent Spaulding, and he's not such a youth, either.
It's hard to say his age.
I should not wish a smarter assistant, Mr. Holmes; and I know very well that he could better himself and earn twice what I am able to give him.
But, after all, if he is satisfied, why should I put ideas in his head?"
"Why, indeed?
You seem most fortunate in having an employ√© who comes under the full market price.
It is not a common experience among employers in this age.
I don't know that your assistant is not as remarkable as your advertisement."
"Oh, he has his faults, too," said Mr. Wilson.
"Never was such a fellow for photography.
Snapping away with a camera when he ought to be improving his mind, and then diving down into the cellar like a rabbit into its hole to develop his pictures.
That is his main fault, but on the whole he's a good worker.
There's no vice in him." "He is still with you, I presume?"
"Yes, sir.
He and a girl of fourteen, who does a bit of simple cooking and keeps the place clean--that's all I have in the house, for I am a widower and never had any family.
We live very quietly, sir, the three of us; and we keep a roof over our heads and pay our debts, if we do nothing more.
"The first thing that put us out was that advertisement.
Spaulding, he came down into the office just this day eight weeks, with this very paper in his hand, and he says: "'I wish to the Lord, Mr. Wilson, that I was a red-headed man.' "'Why that?'
I asks. "'Why,' says he, 'here's another vacancy on the League of the Red-headed Men.
It's worth quite a little fortune to any man who gets it, and I understand that there are more vacancies than there are men, so that the trustees are at their wits' end what to do with the money.
If my hair would only change colour, here's a nice little crib all ready for me to step into.' "'Why, what is it, then?'
I asked.
You see, Mr. Holmes, I am a very stay-at- home man, and as my business came to me instead of my having to go to it, I was often weeks on end without putting my foot over the door-mat.
In that way I didn't know much of what was going on outside, and I was always glad of a bit of news. "'Have you never heard of the League of the Red-headed Men?' he asked with his eyes open. "'Never.' "'Why, I wonder at that, for you are eligible yourself for one of the vacancies.' "'And what are they worth?'
I asked. "'Oh, merely a couple of hundred a year, but the work is slight, and it need not interfere very much with one's other occupations.'
"Well, you can easily think that that made me prick up my ears, for the business has not been over-good for some years, and an extra couple of hundred would have been very handy. "'Tell me all about it,' said I.
"'Well,' said he, showing me the advertisement, 'you can see for yourself that the League has a vacancy, and there is the address where you should apply for particulars.
As far as I can make out, the League was founded by an American millionaire, Ezekiah
Hopkins, who was very peculiar in his ways.
He was himself red-headed, and he had a great sympathy for all red-headed men; so when he died it was found that he had left his enormous fortune in the hands of trustees, with instructions to apply the interest to the providing of easy berths to men whose hair is of that colour.
From all I hear it is splendid pay and very little to do.' "'But,' said I, 'there would be millions of red-headed men who would apply.' "'Not so many as you might think,' he answered.
'You see it is really confined to Londoners, and to grown men.
This American had started from London when he was young, and he wanted to do the old town a good turn.
Then, again, I have heard it is no use your applying if your hair is light red, or dark red, or anything but real bright, blazing, fiery red.
Now, if you cared to apply, Mr. Wilson, you would just walk in; but perhaps it would hardly be worth your while to put yourself out of the way for the sake of a few hundred pounds.'
"Now, it is a fact, gentlemen, as you may see for yourselves, that my hair is of a very full and rich tint, so that it seemed to me that if there was to be any competition in the matter I stood as good a chance as any man that I had ever met.
Vincent Spaulding seemed to know so much about it that I thought he might prove useful, so I just ordered him to put up the shutters for the day and to come right away with me.
He was very willing to have a holiday, so we shut the business up and started off for the address that was given us in the advertisement.
"I never hope to see such a sight as that again, Mr. Holmes.
From north, south, east, and west every man who had a shade of red in his hair had tramped into the city to answer the advertisement.
Fleet Street was choked with red-headed folk, and Pope's Court looked like a coster's orange barrow.
I should not have thought there were so many in the whole country as were brought together by that single advertisement.
Every shade of colour they were--straw, lemon, orange, brick, Irish-setter, liver, clay; but, as Spaulding said, there were not many who had the real vivid flame- coloured tint.
When I saw how many were waiting, I would have given it up in despair; but Spaulding would not hear of it.
How he did it I could not imagine, but he pushed and pulled and butted until he got me through the crowd, and right up to the steps which led to the office.
There was a double stream upon the stair, some going up in hope, and some coming back dejected; but we wedged in as well as we could and soon found ourselves in the office."
"Your experience has been a most entertaining one," remarked Holmes as his client paused and refreshed his memory with a huge pinch of snuff.
"Pray continue your very interesting statement."
"There was nothing in the office but a couple of wooden chairs and a deal table, behind which sat a small man with a head that was even redder than mine.
He said a few words to each candidate as he came up, and then he always managed to find some fault in them which would disqualify them.
Getting a vacancy did not seem to be such a very easy matter, after all.
However, when our turn came the little man was much more favourable to me than to any of the others, and he closed the door as we entered, so that he might have a private word with us. "'This is Mr. Jabez Wilson,' said my assistant, 'and he is willing to fill a vacancy in the League.' "'And he is admirably suited for it,' the other answered.
I cannot recall when I have seen anything so fine.'
He took a step backward, cocked his head on one side, and gazed at my hair until I felt quite bashful.
Then suddenly he plunged forward, wrung my hand, and congratulated me warmly on my success. "'It would be injustice to hesitate,' said he.
'You will, however, I am sure, excuse me for taking an obvious precaution.'
With that he seized my hair in both his hands, and tugged until I yelled with the pain.
'There is water in your eyes,' said he as he released me.
'I perceive that all is as it should be.
But we have to be careful, for we have twice been deceived by wigs and once by paint.
I could tell you tales of cobbler's wax which would disgust you with human nature.'
He stepped over to the window and shouted through it at the top of his voice that the vacancy was filled.
A groan of disappointment came up from below, and the folk all trooped away in different directions until there was not a red-head to be seen except my own and that of the manager. "'My name,' said he, 'is Mr. Duncan Ross, and I am myself one of the pensioners upon the fund left by our noble benefactor.
Are you a married man, Mr. Wilson?
Have you a family?'
"I answered that I had not.
"His face fell immediately. "'Dear me!' he said gravely, 'that is very serious indeed!
I am sorry to hear you say that.
The fund was, of course, for the propagation and spread of the red-heads as well as for their maintenance.
It is exceedingly unfortunate that you should be a bachelor.'
"My face lengthened at this, Mr. Holmes, for I thought that I was not to have the vacancy after all; but after thinking it over for a few minutes he said that it would be all right. "'In the case of another,' said he, 'the objection might be fatal, but we must stretch a point in favour of a man with such a head of hair as yours.
When shall you be able to enter upon your new duties?' "'Well, it is a little awkward, for I have a business already,' said I.
'I should be able to look after that for you.' "'What would be the hours?'
I asked. "'Ten to two.'
"Now a pawnbroker's business is mostly done of an evening, Mr. Holmes, especially
Thursday and Friday evening, which is just before pay-day; so it would suit me very well to earn a little in the mornings.
Besides, I knew that my assistant was a good man, and that he would see to anything that turned up. "'That would suit me very well,' said I.
'And the pay?' "'Is 4 pounds a week.' "'And the work?' "'Is purely nominal.' "'What do you call purely nominal?' "'Well, you have to be in the office, or at least in the building, the whole time.
If you leave, you forfeit your whole position forever.
The will is very clear upon that point.
You don't comply with the conditions if you budge from the office during that time.' "'It's only four hours a day, and I should not think of leaving,' said I.
"'No excuse will avail,' said Mr. Duncan Ross; 'neither sickness nor business nor anything else.
There you must stay, or you lose your billet.' "'And the work?' "'Is to copy out the "Encyclopaedia
There is the first volume of it in that press.
You must find your own ink, pens, and blotting-paper, but we provide this table and chair.
Will you be ready to-morrow?' "'Certainly,' I answered. "'Then, good-bye, Mr. Jabez Wilson, and let me congratulate you once more on the important position which you have been fortunate enough to gain.'
He bowed me out of the room and I went home with my assistant, hardly knowing what to say or do, I was so pleased at my own good fortune.
"Well, I thought over the matter all day, and by evening I was in low spirits again; for I had quite persuaded myself that the whole affair must be some great hoax or fraud, though what its object might be I could not imagine.
It seemed altogether past belief that anyone could make such a will, or that they would pay such a sum for doing anything so simple as copying out the 'Encyclopaedia
Britannica.'
Vincent Spaulding did what he could to cheer me up, but by bedtime I had reasoned myself out of the whole thing.
However, in the morning I determined to have a look at it anyhow, so I bought a penny bottle of ink, and with a quill-pen, and seven sheets of foolscap paper, I started off for Pope's Court.
"Well, to my surprise and delight, everything was as right as possible.
The table was set out ready for me, and Mr. Duncan Ross was there to see that I got fairly to work.
He started me off upon the letter A, and then he left me; but he would drop in from time to time to see that all was right with me.
At two o'clock he bade me good-day, complimented me upon the amount that I had written, and locked the door of the office after me.
"This went on day after day, Mr. Holmes, and on Saturday the manager came in and planked down four golden sovereigns for my week's work.
It was the same next week, and the same the week after.
Every morning I was there at ten, and every afternoon I left at two.
By degrees Mr. Duncan Ross took to coming in only once of a morning, and then, after a time, he did not come in at all.
Still, of course, I never dared to leave the room for an instant, for I was not sure when he might come, and the billet was such a good one, and suited me so well, that I would not risk the loss of it.
"Eight weeks passed away like this, and I had written about Abbots and Archery and
Armour and Architecture and Attica, and hoped with diligence that I might get on to the B's before very long.
It cost me something in foolscap, and I had pretty nearly filled a shelf with my writings.
And then suddenly the whole business came to an end."
"To an end?" "Yes, sir.
And no later than this morning.
I went to my work as usual at ten o'clock, but the door was shut and locked, with a little square of cardboard hammered on to the middle of the panel with a tack.
Here it is, and you can read for yourself."
He held up a piece of white cardboard about the size of a sheet of note-paper.
It read in this fashion: THE RED-HEADED LEAGUE
IS
DlSSOLVED.
October 9, 1890.
Sherlock Holmes and I surveyed this curt announcement and the rueful face behind it, until the comical side of the affair so completely overtopped every other consideration that we both burst out into a roar of laughter.
"I cannot see that there is anything very funny," cried our client, flushing up to the roots of his flaming head.
"If you can do nothing better than laugh at me, I can go elsewhere."
"No, no," cried Holmes, shoving him back into the chair from which he had half risen.
"I really wouldn't miss your case for the world.
It is most refreshingly unusual.
But there is, if you will excuse my saying so, something just a little funny about it.
Pray what steps did you take when you found the card upon the door?"
"I was staggered, sir.
I did not know what to do.
Then I called at the offices round, but none of them seemed to know anything about it.
Finally, I went to the landlord, who is an accountant living on the ground-floor, and
I asked him if he could tell me what had become of the Red-headed League.
He said that he had never heard of any such body.
Then I asked him who Mr. Duncan Ross was.
He answered that the name was new to him. "'Well,' said I, 'the gentleman at No.
4.' "'What, the red-headed man?' "'Yes.' "'Oh,' said he, 'his name was William Morris.
He was a solicitor and was using my room as a temporary convenience until his new premises were ready.
He moved out yesterday.' "'Where could I find him?' "'Oh, at his new offices.
He did tell me the address.
Yes, 17 King Edward Street, near St. Paul's.'
"I started off, Mr. Holmes, but when I got to that address it was a manufactory of artificial knee-caps, and no one in it had ever heard of either Mr. William Morris or
Mr. Duncan Ross."
"And what did you do then?" asked Holmes.
"I went home to Saxe-Coburg Square, and I took the advice of my assistant.
But he could not help me in any way.
He could only say that if I waited I should hear by post.
But that was not quite good enough, Mr. Holmes.
I did not wish to lose such a place without a struggle, so, as I had heard that you were good enough to give advice to poor folk who were in need of it, I came right away to you."
"And you did very wisely," said Holmes.
"Your case is an exceedingly remarkable one, and I shall be happy to look into it.
From what you have told me I think that it is possible that graver issues hang from it than might at first sight appear." "Grave enough!" said Mr. Jabez Wilson.
"Why, I have lost four pound a week."
"As far as you are personally concerned," remarked Holmes, "I do not see that you have any grievance against this extraordinary league.
On the contrary, you are, as I understand, richer by some 30 pounds, to say nothing of the minute knowledge which you have gained on every subject which comes under the letter A.
You have lost nothing by them." "No, sir.
But I want to find out about them, and who they are, and what their object was in playing this prank--if it was a prank--upon me.
It was a pretty expensive joke for them, for it cost them two and thirty pounds."
"We shall endeavour to clear up these points for you.
And, first, one or two questions, Mr. Wilson.
This assistant of yours who first called your attention to the advertisement--how long had he been with you?"
"About a month then." "How did he come?"
"In answer to an advertisement." "Was he the only applicant?"
"No, I had a dozen."
"Why did you pick him?" "Because he was handy and would come cheap." "At half-wages, in fact."
"Yes."
"What is he like, this Vincent Spaulding?" "Small, stout-built, very quick in his ways, no hair on his face, though he's not short of thirty.
Has a white splash of acid upon his forehead."
Holmes sat up in his chair in considerable excitement.
"I thought as much," said he.
"Have you ever observed that his ears are pierced for earrings?"
He told me that a gipsy had done it for him when he was a lad."
"Hum!" said Holmes, sinking back in deep thought.
"He is still with you?" "Oh, yes, sir; I have only just left him."
"And has your business been attended to in your absence?"
"Nothing to complain of, sir.
There's never very much to do of a morning."
"That will do, Mr. Wilson. I shall be happy to give you an opinion upon the subject in the course of a day or two.
To-day is Saturday, and I hope that by Monday we may come to a conclusion."
"Well, Watson," said Holmes when our visitor had left us, "what do you make of it all?"
"I make nothing of it," I answered frankly.
"It is a most mysterious business."
"As a rule," said Holmes, "the more bizarre a thing is the less mysterious it proves to be.
It is your commonplace, featureless crimes which are really puzzling, just as a commonplace face is the most difficult to identify.
But I must be prompt over this matter."
"What are you going to do, then?" I asked.
"To smoke," he answered.
"It is quite a three pipe problem, and I beg that you won't speak to me for fifty minutes."
He curled himself up in his chair, with his thin knees drawn up to his hawk-like nose, and there he sat with his eyes closed and his black clay pipe thrusting out like the bill of some strange bird.
I had come to the conclusion that he had dropped asleep, and indeed was nodding myself, when he suddenly sprang out of his chair with the gesture of a man who has made up his mind and put his pipe down upon the mantelpiece.
"Sarasate plays at the St. James's Hall this afternoon," he remarked.
"What do you think, Watson?
Could your patients spare you for a few hours?"
"I have nothing to do to-day.
My practice is never very absorbing."
"Then put on your hat and come.
I am going through the City first, and we can have some lunch on the way.
I observe that there is a good deal of German music on the programme, which is rather more to my taste than Italian or French.
It is introspective, and I want to introspect.
Come along!"
We travelled by the Underground as far as Aldersgate; and a short walk took us to
Saxe-Coburg Square, the scene of the singular story which we had listened to in the morning.
It was a poky, little, shabby-genteel place, where four lines of dingy two- storied brick houses looked out into a small railed-in enclosure, where a lawn of weedy grass and a few clumps of faded
laurel-bushes made a hard fight against a smoke-laden and uncongenial atmosphere.
Three gilt balls and a brown board with "JABEZ WlLSON" in white letters, upon a corner house, announced the place where our red-headed client carried on his business.
Sherlock Holmes stopped in front of it with his head on one side and looked it all over, with his eyes shining brightly between puckered lids.
Then he walked slowly up the street, and then down again to the corner, still looking keenly at the houses.
Finally he returned to the pawnbroker's, and, having thumped vigorously upon the pavement with his stick two or three times, he went up to the door and knocked.
It was instantly opened by a bright- looking, clean-shaven young fellow, who asked him to step in.
"Thank you," said Holmes, "I only wished to ask you how you would go from here to the
Strand." "Third right, fourth left," answered the assistant promptly, closing the door.
"Smart fellow, that," observed Holmes as we walked away.
"He is, in my judgment, the fourth smartest man in London, and for daring I am not sure that he has not a claim to be third.
I have known something of him before." "Evidently," said I, "Mr. Wilson's assistant counts for a good deal in this mystery of the Red-headed League.
I am sure that you inquired your way merely in order that you might see him."
"Not him." "What then?"
"The knees of his trousers."
"And what did you see?" "What I expected to see."
"Why did you beat the pavement?" "My dear doctor, this is a time for observation, not for talk.
We are spies in an enemy's country.
We know something of Saxe-Coburg Square.
Let us now explore the parts which lie behind it."
The road in which we found ourselves as we turned round the corner from the retired
Saxe-Coburg Square presented as great a contrast to it as the front of a picture does to the back.
It was one of the main arteries which conveyed the traffic of the City to the north and west.
The roadway was blocked with the immense stream of commerce flowing in a double tide inward and outward, while the footpaths were black with the hurrying swarm of pedestrians.
It was difficult to realise as we looked at the line of fine shops and stately business premises that they really abutted on the other side upon the faded and stagnant square which we had just quitted.
"Let me see," said Holmes, standing at the corner and glancing along the line, "I should like just to remember the order of the houses here.
It is a hobby of mine to have an exact knowledge of London.
There is Mortimer's, the tobacconist, the little newspaper shop, the Coburg branch of the City and Suburban Bank, the Vegetarian Restaurant, and McFarlane's carriage- building depot.
That carries us right on to the other block.
And now, Doctor, we've done our work, so it's time we had some play.
A sandwich and a cup of coffee, and then off to violin-land, where all is sweetness and delicacy and harmony, and there are no red-headed clients to vex us with their conundrums."
My friend was an enthusiastic musician, being himself not only a very capable performer but a composer of no ordinary merit.
All the afternoon he sat in the stalls wrapped in the most perfect happiness, gently waving his long, thin fingers in time to the music, while his gently smiling face and his languid, dreamy eyes were as unlike those of Holmes the sleuth-hound, Holmes the relentless, keen-witted, ready- handed criminal agent, as it was possible to conceive.
In his singular character the dual nature alternately asserted itself, and his extreme exactness and astuteness represented, as I have often thought, the reaction against the poetic and contemplative mood which occasionally predominated in him.
The swing of his nature took him from extreme languor to devouring energy; and, as I knew well, he was never so truly formidable as when, for days on end, he had been lounging in his armchair amid his improvisations and his black-letter editions.
Then it was that the lust of the chase would suddenly come upon him, and that his brilliant reasoning power would rise to the level of intuition, until those who were unacquainted with his methods would look askance at him as on a man whose knowledge was not that of other mortals.
When I saw him that afternoon so enwrapped in the music at St. James's Hall I felt that an evil time might be coming upon those whom he had set himself to hunt down.
"You want to go home, no doubt, Doctor," he remarked as we emerged.
"And I have some business to do which will take some hours.
This business at Coburg Square is serious." "Why serious?"
"A considerable crime is in contemplation.
I have every reason to believe that we shall be in time to stop it.
But to-day being Saturday rather complicates matters.
I shall want your help to-night." "At what time?"
"Ten will be early enough."
"I shall be at Baker Street at ten." "Very well.
And, I say, Doctor, there may be some little danger, so kindly put your army revolver in your pocket."
He waved his hand, turned on his heel, and disappeared in an instant among the crowd.
I trust that I am not more dense than my neighbours, but I was always oppressed with a sense of my own stupidity in my dealings with Sherlock Holmes.
Here I had heard what he had heard, I had seen what he had seen, and yet from his words it was evident that he saw clearly not only what had happened but what was about to happen, while to me the whole business was still confused and grotesque.
As I drove home to my house in Kensington I thought over it all, from the extraordinary story of the red-headed copier of the "Encyclopaedia" down to the visit to Saxe-
Coburg Square, and the ominous words with which he had parted from me.
What was this nocturnal expedition, and why should I go armed?
Where were we going, and what were we to do?
I had the hint from Holmes that this smooth-faced pawnbroker's assistant was a formidable man--a man who might play a deep game.
I tried to puzzle it out, but gave it up in despair and set the matter aside until night should bring an explanation.
It was a quarter-past nine when I started from home and made my way across the Park, and so through Oxford Street to Baker Street.
Two hansoms were standing at the door, and as I entered the passage I heard the sound of voices from above.
On entering his room I found Holmes in animated conversation with two men, one of whom I recognised as Peter Jones, the official police agent, while the other was a long, thin, sad-faced man, with a very shiny hat and oppressively respectable frock-coat.
"Ha!
Our party is complete," said Holmes, buttoning up his pea-jacket and taking his heavy hunting crop from the rack.
"Watson, I think you know Mr. Jones, of
Scotland Yard?
Let me introduce you to Mr. Merryweather, who is to be our companion in to-night's adventure."
"We're hunting in couples again, Doctor, you see," said Jones in his consequential way.
"Our friend here is a wonderful man for starting a chase.
All he wants is an old dog to help him to do the running down."
"I hope a wild goose may not prove to be the end of our chase," observed Mr.
Merryweather gloomily.
"You may place considerable confidence in Mr. Holmes, sir," said the police agent
loftily.
"He has his own little methods, which are, if he won't mind my saying so, just a little too theoretical and fantastic, but he has the makings of a detective in him.
It is not too much to say that once or twice, as in that business of the Sholto murder and the Agra treasure, he has been more nearly correct than the official force."
"Oh, if you say so, Mr. Jones, it is all right," said the stranger with deference.
"Still, I confess that I miss my rubber.
It is the first Saturday night for seven- and-twenty years that I have not had my rubber."
"I think you will find," said Sherlock Holmes, "that you will play for a higher stake to-night than you have ever done yet, and that the play will be more exciting.
For you, Mr. Merryweather, the stake will be some 30,000 pounds; and for you, Jones, it will be the man upon whom you wish to lay your hands."
"John Clay, the murderer, thief, smasher, and forger.
He's a young man, Mr. Merryweather, but he is at the head of his profession, and I would rather have my bracelets on him than on any criminal in London.
He's a remarkable man, is young John Clay.
His grandfather was a royal duke, and he himself has been to Eton and Oxford.
His brain is as cunning as his fingers, and though we meet signs of him at every turn, we never know where to find the man himself.
He'll crack a crib in Scotland one week, and be raising money to build an orphanage in Cornwall the next.
I've been on his track for years and have never set eyes on him yet."
"I hope that I may have the pleasure of introducing you to-night.
I've had one or two little turns also with Mr. John Clay, and I agree with you that he is at the head of his profession.
It is past ten, however, and quite time that we started.
If you two will take the first hansom, Watson and I will follow in the second."
Sherlock Holmes was not very communicative during the long drive and lay back in the cab humming the tunes which he had heard in the afternoon.
We rattled through an endless labyrinth of gas-lit streets until we emerged into
Farrington Street. I thought it as well to have Jones with us also.
"This fellow Merryweather is a bank director, and personally interested in the matter.
He is not a bad fellow, though an absolute imbecile in his profession.
He has one positive virtue.
He is as brave as a bulldog and as tenacious as a lobster if he gets his claws upon anyone.
Here we are, and they are waiting for us."
We had reached the same crowded thoroughfare in which we had found ourselves in the morning.
Our cabs were dismissed, and, following the guidance of Mr. Merryweather, we passed down a narrow passage and through a side door, which he opened for us.
Within there was a small corridor, which ended in a very massive iron gate.
This also was opened, and led down a flight of winding stone steps, which terminated at another formidable gate.
Mr. Merryweather stopped to light a lantern, and then conducted us down a dark, earth-smelling passage, and so, after opening a third door, into a huge vault or cellar, which was piled all round with crates and massive boxes.
"You are not very vulnerable from above," Holmes remarked as he held up the lantern and gazed about him.
"Nor from below," said Mr. Merryweather, striking his stick upon the flags which lined the floor.
"Why, dear me, it sounds quite hollow!" he remarked, looking up in surprise.
"I must really ask you to be a little more quiet!" said Holmes severely.
"You have already imperilled the whole success of our expedition.
Might I beg that you would have the goodness to sit down upon one of those boxes, and not to interfere?"
The solemn Mr. Merryweather perched himself upon a crate, with a very injured expression upon his face, while Holmes fell upon his knees upon the floor and, with the lantern and a magnifying lens, began to examine minutely the cracks between the stones.
A few seconds sufficed to satisfy him, for he sprang to his feet again and put his glass in his pocket.
"We have at least an hour before us," he remarked, "for they can hardly take any steps until the good pawnbroker is safely in bed.
Then they will not lose a minute, for the sooner they do their work the longer time they will have for their escape.
We are at present, Doctor--as no doubt you have divined--in the cellar of the City branch of one of the principal London banks.
Mr. Merryweather is the chairman of directors, and he will explain to you that there are reasons why the more daring criminals of London should take a considerable interest in this cellar at present."
"It is our French gold," whispered the director.
"We have had several warnings that an attempt might be made upon it."
We had occasion some months ago to strengthen our resources and borrowed for that purpose 30,000 napoleons from the Bank of France.
"Yes.
It has become known that we have never had occasion to unpack the money, and that it is still lying in our cellar.
The crate upon which I sit contains 2,000 napoleons packed between layers of lead foil.
Our reserve of bullion is much larger at present than is usually kept in a single branch office, and the directors have had misgivings upon the subject."
"Which were very well justified," observed Holmes.
"And now it is time that we arranged our little plans.
I expect that within an hour matters will come to a head.
In the meantime Mr. Merryweather, we must put the screen over that dark lantern."
"And sit in the dark?"
"I am afraid so.
I had brought a pack of cards in my pocket, and I thought that, as we were a partie carr√©e, you might have your rubber after all.
But I see that the enemy's preparations have gone so far that we cannot risk the presence of a light. And, first of all, we must choose our positions.
These are daring men, and though we shall take them at a disadvantage, they may do us some harm unless we are careful.
I shall stand behind this crate, and do you conceal yourselves behind those.
Then, when I flash a light upon them, close in swiftly.
If they fire, Watson, have no compunction about shooting them down."
I placed my revolver, cocked, upon the top of the wooden case behind which I crouched.
Holmes shot the slide across the front of his lantern and left us in pitch darkness-- such an absolute darkness as I have never before experienced.
The smell of hot metal remained to assure us that the light was still there, ready to flash out at a moment's notice.
To me, with my nerves worked up to a pitch of expectancy, there was something depressing and subduing in the sudden gloom, and in the cold dank air of the vault.
"They have but one retreat," whispered Holmes.
"That is back through the house into Saxe- Coburg Square.
I hope that you have done what I asked you, Jones?"
"I have an inspector and two officers waiting at the front door."
"Then we have stopped all the holes.
And now we must be silent and wait."
What a time it seemed!
From comparing notes afterwards it was but an hour and a quarter, yet it appeared to me that the night must have almost gone and the dawn be breaking above us.
My limbs were weary and stiff, for I feared to change my position; yet my nerves were worked up to the highest pitch of tension, and my hearing was so acute that I could not only hear the gentle breathing of my companions, but I could distinguish the deeper, heavier in-breath of the bulky
Jones from the thin, sighing note of the bank director.
From my position I could look over the case in the direction of the floor.
Suddenly my eyes caught the glint of a light.
At first it was but a lurid spark upon the stone pavement.
Then it lengthened out until it became a yellow line, and then, without any warning or sound, a gash seemed to open and a hand appeared, a white, almost womanly hand, which felt about in the centre of the little area of light.
For a minute or more the hand, with its writhing fingers, protruded out of the floor.
Then it was withdrawn as suddenly as it appeared, and all was dark again save the single lurid spark which marked a chink between the stones.
Its disappearance, however, was but momentary.
With a rending, tearing sound, one of the broad, white stones turned over upon its side and left a square, gaping hole, through which streamed the light of a lantern.
Over the edge there peeped a clean-cut, boyish face, which looked keenly about it, and then, with a hand on either side of the aperture, drew itself shoulder-high and waist-high, until one knee rested upon the edge.
In another instant he stood at the side of the hole and was hauling after him a companion, lithe and small like himself, with a pale face and a shock of very red hair.
"It's all clear," he whispered.
"Have you the chisel and the bags?
Great Scott!
Jump, Archie, jump, and I'll swing for it!"
Sherlock Holmes had sprung out and seized the intruder by the collar.
The other dived down the hole, and I heard the sound of rending cloth as Jones clutched at his skirts.
The light flashed upon the barrel of a revolver, but Holmes' hunting crop came down on the man's wrist, and the pistol clinked upon the stone floor.
"It's no use, John Clay," said Holmes blandly.
"You have no chance at all." "So I see," the other answered with the utmost coolness.
"I fancy that my pal is all right, though I see you have got his coat-tails."
"There are three men waiting for him at the door," said Holmes.
"Oh, indeed!
You seem to have done the thing very completely.
I must compliment you." "And I you," Holmes answered.
"Your red-headed idea was very new and effective."
"You'll see your pal again presently," said Jones.
"He's quicker at climbing down holes than I am.
Just hold out while I fix the derbies."
"I beg that you will not touch me with your filthy hands," remarked our prisoner as the handcuffs clattered upon his wrists.
"You may not be aware that I have royal blood in my veins.
Have the goodness, also, when you address me always to say 'sir' and 'please.'"
"All right," said Jones with a stare and a snigger.
"Well, would you please, sir, march upstairs, where we can get a cab to carry your Highness to the police-station?" "That is better," said John Clay serenely.
He made a sweeping bow to the three of us and walked quietly off in the custody of the detective.
"Really, Mr. Holmes," said Mr. Merryweather as we followed them from the cellar, "I do not know how the bank can thank you or repay you.
There is no doubt that you have detected and defeated in the most complete manner one of the most determined attempts at bank robbery that have ever come within my experience."
"I have had one or two little scores of my own to settle with Mr. John Clay," said
Holmes.
"I have been at some small expense over this matter, which I shall expect the bank to refund, but beyond that I am amply repaid by having had an experience which is in many ways unique, and by hearing the very remarkable narrative of the Red-headed League."
"You see, Watson," he explained in the early hours of the morning as we sat over a glass of whisky and soda in Baker Street, "it was perfectly obvious from the first that the only possible object of this rather fantastic business of the advertisement of the League, and the copying of the 'Encyclopaedia,' must be to get this not over-bright pawnbroker out of the way for a number of hours every day.
It was a curious way of managing it, but, really, it would be difficult to suggest a better.
The method was no doubt suggested to Clay's ingenious mind by the colour of his accomplice's hair.
The 4 pounds a week was a lure which must draw him, and what was it to them, who were playing for thousands?
They put in the advertisement, one rogue has the temporary office, the other rogue incites the man to apply for it, and together they manage to secure his absence every morning in the week.
From the time that I heard of the assistant having come for half wages, it was obvious to me that he had some strong motive for securing the situation."
"But how could you guess what the motive was?"
"Had there been women in the house, I should have suspected a mere vulgar intrigue.
That, however, was out of the question.
The man's business was a small one, and there was nothing in his house which could account for such elaborate preparations, and such an expenditure as they were at.
It must, then, be something out of the house.
What could it be?
I thought of the assistant's fondness for photography, and his trick of vanishing into the cellar.
The cellar!
There was the end of this tangled clue.
Then I made inquiries as to this mysterious assistant and found that I had to deal with one of the coolest and most daring criminals in London.
He was doing something in the cellar-- something which took many hours a day for months on end.
What could it be, once more?
I could think of nothing save that he was running a tunnel to some other building.
"So far I had got when we went to visit the scene of action.
I surprised you by beating upon the pavement with my stick.
I was ascertaining whether the cellar stretched out in front or behind.
It was not in front.
Then I rang the bell, and, as I hoped, the assistant answered it.
We have had some skirmishes, but we had never set eyes upon each other before.
I hardly looked at his face.
His knees were what I wished to see.
You must yourself have remarked how worn, wrinkled, and stained they were.
They spoke of those hours of burrowing.
The only remaining point was what they were burrowing for.
I walked round the corner, saw the City and Suburban Bank abutted on our friend's premises, and felt that I had solved my problem.
When you drove home after the concert I called upon Scotland Yard and upon the chairman of the bank directors, with the result that you have seen."
"And how could you tell that they would make their attempt to-night?"
I asked.
"Well, when they closed their League offices that was a sign that they cared no longer about Mr. Jabez Wilson's presence-- in other words, that they had completed their tunnel.
But it was essential that they should use it soon, as it might be discovered, or the bullion might be removed.
Saturday would suit them better than any other day, as it would give them two days for their escape.
For all these reasons I expected them to come to-night."
"You reasoned it out beautifully," I exclaimed in unfeigned admiration.
"It is so long a chain, and yet every link rings true."
"It saved me from ennui," he answered, yawning.
"Alas!
I already feel it closing in upon me.
My life is spent in one long effort to escape from the commonplaces of existence.
"And you are a benefactor of the race," said I.
He shrugged his shoulders.
"Well, perhaps, after all, it is of some
little use," he remarked. "'L'homme c'est rien--I'oeuvre c'est tout,' as Gustave Flaubert wrote to George Sand." &gt;
ÔªøThey came...
They came with their bulldozers... and they came with their soldiers.
I never left my house and defended it strongly, but they didn't listen to me.
To me it's just like a war zone.
It's like somebody just dropped a bomb here and just boom - dispersed everybody.
Has everyone seen the company's plans?
Our homes do not exist in their plans.
(Don't destroy people's homes!)
Everyone please come look at the thieves stealing people's land!
Mayors come and go, presidents come and go, and the poor continue in the same situation.
It's always the same story.
They say these mega-projects bring development, we've been to several countries and this development does not exist.
[PEOPLE BEFORE PROFlT]
Forced evictions are when people are forcibly moved from their home, from their land, from their community, from their neighborhood, from their culture, against their will or desire for projects that often have no benefit to the communities that are being evicted.
Forced eviction normally is done by companies, private companies with the assistance of the local authorities or the government.
They evict people from their original place without fair compensation, and using force, using violence.
The groups that lack economic or political power are the ones that would most often be susceptible to forced eviction.
No development can violate human rights.
So we need to question how to balance large projects, or what people believe to be development, with improving the quality of people's lives.
I understand that the duty, obligation, of the government is to develop the country.
But develop the country is not develop the country for the sake, for the benefit of only a small amount of people.
The rich become richer, and the poor become poorer.
How can any project that leads to further impoverishment of the communities, removing them from their livelihood sources, be called development?
The truth is 'development' has become a scary word to many people because in its name many crimes are committed against many people.
Wherever a forced eviction takes place, there's a pattern of violations that we can see very clearly.
Before an eviction, communities often aren't consulted about the projects, they receive no information about what's happening, and there's often intimidation, harassment, threats and even physical violence pressuring these communities to accept the projects.
When they come here, they always say to us:
'If you don't accept this offer, a tractor will come and destroy your home.'
You have not respected our human rights, not as Mexicans, not as citizens, and not as humans.
You've never consulted or asked the community if we agree with being flooded or resettled.
We were hearing from time to time that we would be evicted, but we did not receive any eviction notice.
They came at 7 in the morning and forced us to vacate our houses.
Forget about saving our belongings...
My grandson was still asleep when we were being evicted.
During the eviction, the most repeated pattern is use of force and violence, and violation of all sorts of fundamental and human rights that we can possibly imagine.
Normally the residents are in a state of shock.
Sometimes houses are destroyed with residents' belongings still inside, so besides losing their homes, they lose everything they own.
So it's generally a violent process.
You evict people from the place that they've lived for a long time, and they were brought to another place, far away from the first one.
And the new place, most of the new places have no jobs, no electricity, no running water, no market, no schools for the children, no medical care close by, so it's really very bad for the people.
After a forced eviction, families are often left to fend for themselves, they have no place to go.
When there is a resettlement option it's often inadequate, and the main thing we see with communities that go through forced eviction is that they're left in a worse off condition than they were before the eviction.
The people here were treated like garbage.
There used to be 150 homes and small businesses here.
We didn't get any kind of compensation, small businesses didn't get anything.
If we move to another place, the same thing will happen.
We will be forced to leave.
Everyone who lives around here:
You should stand up!
(The people united will never be defeated!)
We see a pattern of resistance, through petitions, meetings, negotiations with the government, protests, public demonstrations.
Solidarity is the most important aspect of resistance.
Solidarity with each other and standing up as one, instead of facing forced eviction and staying silent - being victimized.
No matter who has the power in any state, they cannot stand in the way of a large number of people. For years, all of these actions have helped communities facing forced evictions
learn from each other and build upon each other, locally and internationally. And through this, they've not only claimed but they've also gained a larger stake in deciding what kind of development actually benefits them.
(Stop acts of violence!)
We taught our people about advocacy, human rights, and many other things our community has never done.
A low-income community in Rio de Janeiro presented its own counter-proposal for developing the community in reaction to the threat of forced eviction by the government.
We, the community land owners, took to the streets and to the courts because they want to take our lands and river, and we don't agree with that.
Out of 10 eviction cases that we've challenged to court, we've won them all.
With that, we have gained the dignity of the poor people.
You cannot just come and evict people, you need to follow proper channels of engagement. There are communities that are not aware that their situation is not theirs alone or specific to their region, but it is a shared situation.
So it's necessary to try to link local situations to the broader and more international issues.
You have South Korean companies investing in India.
You have Indian companies investing in South Africa. If the nature of that transaction and finance and the people causing these evictions are international in nature, then the campaigns ought to be international in nature.
We are in a globalized world, and we ought to have campaigns that are global.
We have no choice.
States must incorporate a new approach which places the citizens and the communities at the center of decision-making.
People need to come before profits. Real development should improve the lives of families, and not tear these lives apart.
We must put people's interests before economic interests or large projects.
These men are not crazy.
They're merely passing the time.
Waiting to die.
And as they inch ever closer towards oblivion they search madly for that spark of human understanding.
A spark that illuminates, however briefly what it is to live.
They're trying to communicate.
They are trying to connect.
They're trying to say the same thing.
Each of them says a random word and they both say whatever word connects those two words. And they keep doing that until they say the same thing.
Here Damian has said "pirate". And Tim has said "depression". Trying to find something between "pirate" and "depression", Damian says
"drown", because a depressed pirate might drown himself. Tim says "roadie", because roadies are essentially pirates who sometimes get depressed.
They both then say "fast Tommy", for Fast Tommy Casamada, a former guitar tech who once nearly drowned in a cup of soup.
They have said the same thing.
They have made a human connection.
Peering into the dark abyss of existance and finding light.
The light of empathy, understanding and friendship, only to once again find themselves alone.
But I made an app so you can always play, no matter where you are. And you're never alone.
Say the same thing, a game you play on your phone.
Don't feel cold and alone in the universe.
Instead, say the same thing, and have fun word times with your buddies.

Last year I showed these two slides so that demonstrate that the arctic ice cap, which for most of the last three million years has been the size of the lower 48 states, has shrunk by 40 percent.
But this understates the seriousness of this particular problem because it doesn't show the thickness of the ice.
The arctic ice cap is, in a sense, the beating heart of the global climate system.
It expands in winter and contracts in summer.
The next slide I show you will be a rapid fast-forward of what's happened over the last 25 years.
The permanent ice is marked in red.
As you see, it expands to the dark blue -- that's the annual ice in winter, and it contracts in summer.
The so-called permanent ice, five years old or older, you can see is almost like blood, spilling out of the body here.
In 25 years it's gone from this, to this.
This is a problem because the warming heats up the frozen ground around the Arctic Ocean, where there is a massive amount of frozen carbon which, when it thaws, is turned into methane by microbes.
Compared to the total amount of global warming pollution in the atmosphere, that amount could double if we cross this tipping point.
Already in some shallow lakes in Alaska, methane is actively bubbling up out of the water.
Professor Katey Walter from the University of Alaska went out with another team to another shallow lake last winter.
Video:
Whoa!
(Laughter)
Al Gore:
She's okay.
The question is whether we will be.
And one reason is, this enormous heat sink heats up Greenland from the north.
This is an annual melting river.
But the volumes are much larger than ever.
This is the Kangerlussuaq River in southwest Greenland.
If you want to know how sea level rises from land-base ice melting this is where it reaches the sea.
These flows are increasing very rapidly.
At the other end of the planet, Antarctica the largest mass of ice on the planet.
Last month scientists reported the entire continent is now in negative ice balance.
And west Antarctica cropped up on top some under-sea islands, is particularly rapid in its melting.
That's equal to 20 feet of sea level, as is Greenland.
In the Himalayas, the third largest mass of ice: at the top you see new lakes, which a few years ago were glaciers.
40 percent of all the people in the world get half of their drinking water from that melting flow.
In the Andes, this glacier is the source of drinking water for this city.
The flows have increased.
But when they go away, so does much of the drinking water.
In California there has been a 40 percent decline in the Sierra snowpack.
This is hitting the reservoirs.
And the predictions, as you've read, are serious.
This drying around the world has lead to a dramatic increase in fires.
And the disasters around the world have been increasing at an absolutely extraordinary and unprecedented rate.
Four times as many in the last 30 years as in the previous 75.
This is a completely unsustainable pattern.
If you look at in the context of history you can see what this is doing.
In the last five years we've added 70 million tons of CO2 every 24 hours -- 25 million tons every day to the oceans.
Look carefully at the area of the eastern Pacific, from the Americas, extending westward, and on either side of the Indian subcontinent, where there is a radical depletion of oxygen in the oceans.
The biggest single cause of global warming, along with deforestation, which is 20 percent of it, is the burning of fossil fuels.
Oil is a problem, and coal is the most serious problem.
The United States is one of the two largest emitters, along with China.
And the proposal has been to build a lot more coal plants.
But we're beginning to see a sea change.
Here are the ones that have been cancelled in the last few years with some green alternatives proposed.
(Applause)
However there is a political battle in our country.
And the coal industries and the oil industries spent a quarter of a billion dollars in the last calendar year promoting clean coal, which is an oxymoron.
That image reminded me of something.
(Laughter)
Around Christmas, in my home in Tennessee, a billion gallons of coal sludge was spilled.
You probably saw it on the news.
This, all over the country, is the second largest waste stream in America.
This happened around Christmas.
One of the coal industry's ads around Christmas was this one.
Video: ‚ô™‚ô´ Frosty the coal man is a jolly, happy soul.
He's abundant here in America, and he helps our economy grow.
Frosty the coal man is getting cleaner everyday.
He's affordable and adorable, and workers keep their pay.
Al Gore:
This is the source of much of the coal in West Virginia.
The largest mountaintop miner is the head of Massey Coal.
Video:
Don Blankenship:
Let me be clear about it.
Al Gore,
Nancy Pelosi, Harry Reid, they don't know what they're talking about.
So the Alliance for Climate Protection has launched two campaigns.
This is one of them, part of one of them. At COALergy we view climate change as a very serious threat to our business.
Actor:
That's why we've made it our primary goal to spend a large sum of money on an advertising effort to help bring out and complicate the truth about coal.
The fact is, coal isn't dirty.
We think it's clean -- smells good, too.
So don't worry about climate change.
Leave that up to us.
(Laughter)
Video:
Actor:
Clean coal -- you've heard a lot about it.
So let's take a tour of this state-of-the-art clean coal facility.
Amazing!
The machinery is kind of loud.
But that's the sound of clean coal technology.
And while burning coal is one of the leading causes of global warming, the remarkable clean coal technology you see here changes everything.
Take a good long look: this is today's clean coal technology.
Al Gore: Finally, the positive alternative meshes with our economic challenge and our national security challenge.
America is in crisis -- the economy, national security, the climate crisis.
Narrator:
The thread that links them all: our addiction to carbon based fuels, like dirty coal and foreign oil.
But now there is a bold new solution to get us out of this mess.
Repower America with 100 percent clean electricity within 10 years.
A plan to put America back to work, make us more secure, and help stop global warming.
Finally, a solution that's big enough to solve our problems.
Repower America.
Find out more.
Al Gore:
This is the last one.
Video:
Narrator:
It's about repowering America.
One of the fastest ways to cut our dependence on old dirty fuels that are killing our planet.
Man:
Future's over here.
Wind, sun, a new energy grid.
Man #2:
New investments to create high-paying jobs.
Narrator:
Repower America.
It's time to get real.
Al Gore:
There is an old African proverb that says,
"If you want to go quickly, go alone.
If you want to go far, go together."
We need to go far, quickly.
Thank you very much.
(Applause)
Imagine a big explosion as you climb through 3,000 ft.
Imagine a plane full of smoke.
Imagine an engine going clack, clack, clack.
It sounds scary.
Well, I had a unique seat that day.
I was sitting in 1D.
I was the only one who could talk to the flight attendants.
So I looked at them right away, and they said, "No problem.
We probably hit some birds."
The pilot had already turned the plane around, and we weren't that far.
You could see Manhattan.
Two minutes later, three things happened at the same time.
The pilot lines up the plane with the Hudson River.
That's usually not the route.
(Laughter)
He turns off the engines.
Now, imagine being in a plane with no sound.
And then he says three words. The most unemotional three words I've ever heard.
He says, "Brace for impact."
I didn't have to talk to the flight attendant anymore.
(Laughter)
I could see in her eyes, it was terror.
Life was over.
Now I want to share with you three things I learned about myself that day.
I learned that it all changes in an instant.
We have this bucket list, we have these things we want to do in life, and I thought about all the people I wanted to reach out to that I didn't, all the fences I wanted to mend, all the experiences I wanted to have and I never did.
As I thought about that later on,
I came up with a saying, which is, "I collect bad wines."
Because if the wine is ready and the person is there, I'm opening it.
I no longer want to postpone anything in life.
And that urgency, that purpose, has really changed my life.
The second thing I learned that day -- and this is as we clear the George Washington Bridge, which was by not a lot -- (Laughter)
I thought about, wow, I really feel one real regret.
I've lived a good life.
In my own humanity and mistakes, I've tried to get better at everything I tried.
But in my humanity, I also allow my ego to get in.
And I regretted the time I wasted on things that did not matter with people that matter.
And I thought about my relationship with my wife, with my friends, with people.
And after, as I reflected on that, I decided to eliminate negative energy from my life.
It's not perfect, but it's a lot better.
I've not had a fight with my wife in two years.
It feels great. I no longer try to be right; I choose to be happy.
The third thing I learned -- and this is as your mental clock starts going, "15, 14, 13."
You can see the water coming.
I'm saying, "Please blow up."
I don't want this thing to break in 20 pieces like you've seen in those documentaries.
And as we're coming down, I had a sense of, wow, dying is not scary.
It's almost like we've been preparing for it our whole lives.
But it was very sad.
I didn't want to go; I love my life.
And that sadness really framed in one thought, which is, I only wish for one thing.
I only wish I could see my kids grow up.
About a month later, I was at a performance by my daughter -- first-grader, not much artistic talent -- (Laughter)
Yet! (Laughter)
And I'm bawling, I'm crying, like a little kid.
And it made all the sense in the world to me.
I realized at that point, by connecting those two dots, that the only thing that matters in my life is being a great dad.
Above all, above all, the only goal I have in life is to be a good dad.
I was given the gift of a miracle, of not dying that day.
I was given another gift, which was to be able to see into the future and come back and live differently.
I challenge you guys that are flying today, imagine the same thing happens on your plane -- and please don't -- but imagine, and how would you change?
What would you get done that you're waiting to get done because you think you'll be here forever?
How would you change your relationships and the negative energy in them?
And more than anything, are you being the best parent you can?
Thank you.
(Applause)

This cannot be happening.
We have a dead body in our bathtub.
A police forensic team combing our house for evidence.
And I finally meet a quality guy and he leaves before I can get his number.
Can this day get any worse?!
I'm Detective Chad Winters.
I'd like to ask you a few questions.
Things aren't that bad.
Look on the bright side.
We have a hot detective.
Looks like he died of natural causes.
Maybe a heart attack.
Heart attack.
But he was so young!
I mean, he and I were practically the same age.
Didn't we celebrate your 40th Birthday for the 5th time last...
Shut up Wood!
So you guys found him this morning?
Well, Reggie did.
It was hard to miss him.
He had, you know, "morning wood".
Good Morning.
He's not talking to you Doofus!
So that was when you three called Police.
Was there anyone else in the house when you discovered the body?
Just my boyfriend.
Oh, Nelson, boyfriend already?
What's your boyfriends name?
Hot Toddy...Todd.
What's his last name?
Um, I don't know.
Do you have a number where he can be reached?
No, I don't have a number where he can be reached.
Ok, so maybe "boyfriend" is a bit premature.
What is this an interrogation?!
I'm just doing my job.
I'm going to go check with forensics and see what they've come up with.
I'll be right back.
Excuse me, Detective Winters?
I was wondering. don't know what your schedule is, but
I know this very intimate dark bar.
Bar?
Why go to a bar, when I can fuck you right here?
No.
It's just that sometimes when I've have a cocktail or two
I tend to remember more, and I might think of something.
No.
Well if you're not...
No!
He's obviously straight!
Wait a minute.
I knew it, he wants me!
How can I help you Detective?
Weren't you a Colt Model?
I was uh... back in the 90's.
Wood Burns.
That's actually a stage name.
Burns is a stage name.
Wood was short for Woodrow, which is my real name.
But then I thought, you know what?
Wood, actually does burn.
And I thought
You know, I want to try and make some kind of statement with my name.
And be like this cool guy... but I never really figured out what that statement was...
Wood, was your neighborhood sprayed with a lot of the DDT when your were a child?
I don't know.
I was such a huge fan of yours.
I had your poster on my wall in college.
You were so hot back then!
Still are in my opinion.
Can I get my picture taken with you?
That would be awesome!
Reggie, take the picture!
Ya, Reggie, take their picture.
Be sure and focus.
Say "cheese".
Thanks man.
Ya, no problem.
And by the way, if this does turn out to be a homicide, you're all suspects.
Thanks.
Awesome!
I think he likes me.
I know what you're thinking.
You think I've lost my way, and somebody's going to come on the stage in a minute and guide me gently back to my seat.
(Applause)
I get that all the time in Dubai.
"Here on holiday are you, dear?"
(Laughter)
"Come to visit the children?
How long are you staying?"
Well actually, I hope for a while longer yet.
I have been living and teaching in the Gulf for over 30 years.
(Applause)
And in that time, I have seen a lot of changes.
Now that statistic is quite shocking.
And I want to talk to you today about language loss and the globalization of English.
I want to tell you about my friend who was teaching English to adults in Abu Dhabi.
And one fine day, she decided to take them into the garden to teach them some nature vocabulary.
But it was she who ended up learning all the Arabic words for the local plants, as well as their uses -- medicinal uses, cosmetics, cooking, herbal.
How did those students get all that knowledge?
Of course, from their grandparents and even their great-grandparents.
It's not necessary to tell you how important it is to be able to communicate across generations.
But sadly, today, languages are dying at an unprecedented rate.
A language dies every 14 days.
Now, at the same time, English is the undisputed global language.
Could there be a connection?
Well I don't know.
But I do know that I've seen a lot of changes.
When I first came out to the Gulf, I came to Kuwait in the days when it was still a hardship post.
Actually, not that long ago.
That is a little bit too early.
But nevertheless,
I was recruited by the British Council, along with about 25 other teachers.
And we were the first non-Muslims to teach in the state schools there in Kuwait.
We were brought to teach English because the government wanted to modernize the country and to empower the citizens through education.
And of course, the U.K. benefited from some of that lovely oil wealth.
Okay.
Now this is the major change that I've seen -- how teaching English has morphed from being a mutually beneficial practice to becoming a massive international business that it is today.
No longer just a foreign language on the school curriculum, and no longer the sole domain of mother England, it has become a bandwagon for every English-speaking nation on earth.
And why not?
After all, the best education -- according to the latest World University Rankings -- is to be found in the universities of the U.K. and the U.S.
So everybody wants to have an English education, naturally.
But if you're not a native speaker, you have to pass a test.
Now can it be right to reject a student on linguistic ability alone?
Perhaps you have a computer scientist who's a genius.
Would he need the same language as a lawyer, for example?
Well, I don't think so.
We English teachers reject them all the time.
We put a stop sign, and we stop them in their tracks.
They can't pursue their dream any longer, 'til they get English.
Now let me put it this way: if I met a monolingual Dutch speaker who had the cure for cancer, would I stop him from entering my British University?
I don't think so.
But indeed, that is exactly what we do.
We English teachers are the gatekeepers.
And you have to satisfy us first that your English is good enough.
Now it can be dangerous to give too much power to a narrow segment of society.
Maybe the barrier would be too universal.
Okay.
"But," I hear you say,
"what about the research?
It's all in English."
So the books are in English, the journals are done in English, but that is a self-fulfilling prophecy.
It feeds the English requirement.
And so it goes on.
I ask you, what happened to translation?
If you think about the Islamic Golden Age, there was lots of translation then.
They translated from Latin and Greek into Arabic, into Persian, and then it was translated on into the Germanic languages of Europe and the Romance languages.
And so light shone upon the Dark Ages of Europe.
Now don't get me wrong;
I am not against teaching English, all you English teachers out there.
I love it that we have a global language.
We need one today more than ever.
But I am against using it as a barrier.
Do we really want to end up with 600 languages and the main one being English, or Chinese?
We need more than that.
Where do we draw the line?
This system equates intelligence with a knowledge of English, which is quite arbitrary.
(Applause)
And I want to remind you that the giants upon whose shoulders today's intelligentsia stand did not have to have English, they didn't have to pass an English test.
Case in point, Einstein.
He, by the way, was considered remedial at school because he was, in fact, dyslexic.
But fortunately for the world, he did not have to pass an English test.
Because they didn't start until 1964 with TOEFL, the American test of English.
Now it's exploded.
There are lots and lots of tests of English.
And millions and millions of students take these tests every year.
Now you might think, you and me, "Those fees aren't bad, they're okay," but they are prohibitive to so many millions of poor people.
So immediately, we're rejecting them.
(Applause)
It brings to mind a headline I saw recently:
"Education:
The Great Divide."
Now I get it,
I understand why people would want to focus on English.
They want to give their children the best chance in life.
And to do that, they need a Western education.
Because, of course, the best jobs go to people out of the Western Universities, that I put on earlier.
It's a circular thing.
Okay.
Let me tell you a story about two scientists, two English scientists.
They were doing an experiment to do with genetics and the forelimbs and the hind limbs of animals.
But they couldn't get the results they wanted.
They really didn't know what to do, until along came a German scientist who realized that they were using two words for forelimb and hind limb, whereas genetics does not differentiate and neither does German.
So bingo, problem solved.
If you can't think a thought, you are stuck.
But if another language can think that thought, then, by cooperating, we can achieve and learn so much more.
My daughter came to England from Kuwait.
She had studied science and mathematics in Arabic.
It's an Arabic-medium school.
She had to translate it into English at her grammar school.
And she was the best in the class at those subjects.
Which tells us that when students come to us from abroad, we may not be giving them enough credit for what they know, and they know it in their own language.
When a language dies, we don't know what we lose with that language.
This is -- I don't know if you saw it on CNN recently -- they gave the Heroes Award to a young Kenyan shepherd boy who couldn't study at night in his village, like all the village children, because the kerosene lamp, it had smoke and it damaged his eyes.
And anyway, there was never enough kerosene, because what does a dollar a day buy for you?
So he invented a cost-free solar lamp.
And now the children in his village get the same grades at school as the children who have electricity at home.
(Applause)
When he received his award, he said these lovely words:
"The children can lead Africa from what it is today, a dark continent, to a light continent."
A simple idea, but it could have such far-reaching consequences.
People who have no light, whether it's physical or metaphorical, cannot pass our exams, and we can never know what they know.
Let us not keep them and ourselves in the dark.
Let us celebrate diversity.
Mind your language.
Use it to spread great ideas.
(Applause)
Thank you very much.
(Applause)
That was amazing, Juan.
So, will I see you next week?
Of course, Papi.
Wood, I told you.
Juan doesn't like you doing his job for him while he's taking his break.
I had to to do something to drown out the sound.
Have you seen Nelson this morning?
No, he was gone before I got up.
Well, we need to sit him down and give him the facts.
That Todd is way more involved in this murder than he is willing to admit.
He's never going to believe us.
Look, I know I come down hard on Nelson, sometimes but he's not delusional.
Sooner or later he's going to come to his senses.
Really, at his core, Nelson is a very serious person.
What?!
So, where were you, an audition?
No, Wood, actually I was at Von's.
I always do our weekly grocery shopping dressed as a circus clown.
Of course, I was in an audition you idiot!
Oh, how did it go?
Horribly.
Yeah, I finally got in on that John Wayne Gacy bio pic.
I mean, it's the role of a lifetime.
But, because of you two. I blew it.
How is your bad acting, our fault.
I am not a bad actor.
But today, I kind of was because last night I didn't get to have sex with my life partner.
Oh, now he's your life partner.
Oh my God, it's been less than a week!
I've had blowjobs that lasted longer!
Your insistence that I questioned him, again, ruined our entire dinner.
So today, that's all I could think about.
I prepared for hours for this audition.
I practice stabbing. Kidnapping.
I even practiced digging underneath the house.
And you know I hate manual labor.
But I went into the audition and I mangled it.
That's what you say about every audition.
Anyway, here's what I was supposed to do.
It was just suppose to be one line, okay?
One line!
It's the part where, you know, Gacy's dressed up as Pogo the Clown.
And goes to a kid's birthday party and he turns, I was suppose to turn towards camera and be really menacing and creepy.
Menacing and creepy that you with the Eagle every Friday night.
Yeah, that's right in your wheel house.
Here's what I was suppose to do.
Hi kids!
Come closer!
It's me!
Pogo! ooohh, Awe...
But I couldn't even remember the line because of last night's date debacle!
Okay you know what,
I wish you guys could just let this whole Todd's a killer thing go.
I wish we could too, Nelson, but Wood and I are dealing in reality.
Let's play connect the dots.
No, no.
I don't think we should play games right now.
I think we should focus on this case.
Duley noted.
Okay, we know that J-Cub was poisoned at our party.
We know that he didn't have anything to eat he just had something to drink.
We know that Hot Toddy was the bartender and we know you told him we found J-Cubs Martini glass. and then somebody broke into our house looking for it!
Okay, come on you guys we all have to be thinking the same thing!
What?
Look you two!
The guy that we should be focused on is Ramone Santiago!
Toddy told me he was obsessed with J-Cub.
Yes, he sent him all sorts of threatening phone calls and emails.
He's got a huge temper and he's really jealous and J-Cub was actually frightened of him.
What should we do?
Well, I've actually been thinking about that, okay.
Because one time I had a walk-on role in an indie feature.
Where I took the time, as an actor, to prepare a backstory for my character.
I named him Marvin and he was a crack addict with OCD.
And he lost his house in foreclosure.
Get to the point, Nelson!
Anyway, To prepare for the role
I actually went down and spent the night, down on skid row.
And came dangerously close to injecting a heroin speed ball with a hooker...
Still not getting to the point, Nelson!
My point is we should go undercover at the Eagle.
Try to get some clues about the murder.
That's a great idea!
You know what we can do?
We could act like customers
And order beers and hit on guys and stuff.
We do that every weekend!
Okay, here's what we're gonna do. I'm gonna go in the house and come up with our covers!
Our character bios!
And our inner monologues!
I love this stuff!
Oh, good the plumbers here.
I didn't know there was a problem with the plumbing.
There isn't.
Hey Sergei!
Wood, there he is.
It's Ramone!
What do you have to do to get a drink around here!!
Move your ass bar keep!
Hey, I think you've had a little too much pal.
Why don't I call you a cab.
Why don't you mind your own business and climb back up that beanstalk!
Fine.
Get out of here!!
That was awesome Lester.
You totally sold the out of control, drunk guy bit.
I started drinking at 5.
And that bartender totally ignored me.
And I just won't be ignored.
No, I get it.
I get it.
Here's a $20 for your troubles and go sleep it off, okay.
Hey, Ramone Santiago.
I own this place.
Hi.
So, my boys Hulk and Thor here just stood around like a couple of retarded statues watching that guy caused a scene, but you stepped in.
What's your name?
Wood Burns.
Yes, The Wood Burns.
I get recognized all the time.
Sorry man, I have no idea who the hell you are.
But I do recognize a good bouncer when I see him.
Well, I was going to ask you if you wanted a job, but apparently, you're super famous, so...
No, no, no.
I'm not that famous.
I haven't done a calendar since like 1998.
I would love to work here.
Alright.
Let's go fill out the paperwork.
And, of course, you're going to have to give me a blow job.
Totally understandable.
Yeah, right?
Yeah.
Yes.
I'm in!
He want's me to start tonight!
Wood, have you even thought about how you are going to portrait this brooding bouncer with a dark past?
Have you thought about your subtext, your hopes, your wishes, your family history, anything?
I was just going to be myself.
And that's why I'm the only one here with a SAG card.
Okay sexy, you all set?
The show starts in 5 minutes.
I told you Toddy, I'm not doing it.
Oh, you're doing it.
What?
I'm trying to get him to enter the bear chest contest.
He's a shoe in to win.
He's the hottest guy here.
You're doing it.
Me, in a bear chest contest? Have you ever heard of anything more ridiculous?
No, no, no.
It's perfect.
You'll be up on stage, in full view of the entire bar.
You can keep an eye on Ramone and his goons.
While Reggie and I sneak back there and look for clues and shit.
It's perfect.
How come the only time you actually make sense, is when it involves me humiliating myself?
Just lucky, I guess.
Hey Reggie, what's up?
Hey Sexy. How are you?
I really miss J-Cub.
Oh, ya?
This whole murder thing is really freaking me out.
What?
We were friends, you know.
We shared everything.
Leather gear, chapstick, sometimes even boyfriends.
Boyfriends?
We also had this timeshare together in Palm Springs.
Hey, if you ever need a weekend getaway, let me know.
I can rent it to you real cheap.
I'm broke and I need a new computer.
He was suppose to let me borrow the money before he died.
He had some extra cash cause he was doing some freelance accounting work for Ramone.
Accounting?
To be honest Cyril the only words I was able to make out from that whole speech were chapstick and timeshare.
You lent J-cub chapstick and you have a timeshare in Palm Springs.
Am I even warm?
Yah.
Don't worry your still hot.
I said you're hot!
Reggie!
Reggie, come on!
Come on man, let's go!
Find me later.
I gotta go!
Fuck me, those lights are bright.
Okay, hey everyone!
How's it going tonight?
So, my name is Todd, and I will be the host for our Mr. Bear Chest 2012 Contest this evening.
We have 4 contestants for you.
And right now, let's get a look at them. Tell them to come out.
Contestant #1!
Contestant #2!
Contestant #3! and contestant #4!
There are your Bear Chest Contestants.

Episode 12
You are leaving already?
It's late so just sleep over.
No, thanks.
I have some books to look over, so I'll just go.
Hey...
You should stop, and move back in now.
I know you are living on your own to find your goal in life, but what about my dream of living happily together, all of us, and living a bustling life?
Your being like this is making it hard on Ha Ni as well.
From her perspective she may be thinking that she is the reason why you won't come home, so be a little more nurturing and caring of her.
Please allow me to make my own decisions regarding my life.
I do not want to be manipulated.
Seung Jo...
I did not want to stay in this house, that's why I left.
You brought Ha Ni back in without even asking, or considering my feelings on the matter.
Because of that, do whatever you want Mother.
Baek Seung Jo...
I am sorry.
I am leaving now.
Dear, understand him...
It's not like I said anything about him not coming back.
He left in search of his dream and to change himself in the process.
But in the end, nothing has changed.
We do not ever see him around.
He is still as cold as ever towards Ha Ni.
Dear, how about you sit down and have another talk with him?
He will at least listen to his father
Even if I talk, does that mean he'll even listen?
Let's just wait, and see what kind of decision he makes.
But, besides that, has he been eating well on his own?
Judging by what I am seeing it seems his face has sunken in.
Let's wait a bit.
At least, he makes his own decision. He should be fine.
You think so?
Enjoy the meal!
We will eat well!
Ah!
It's hot.
What's wrong with your hand?
Housewife's eczema.
This is what happens when you wash the hair of 50 people a day.
Oh my gosh...
Oh man does not it hurt?
Yeah it hurts it itches, hurts, and is driving me insane!
But it's better than sitting in class studying boring material!
I am still happy!
Min Ah how is the web comic you are working on?
Well I am drawing characters, and working at a part time job now.
But, what about you guys always being busy and leaving me alone!
I really can not this time.
After messing up, I always end up writing reports.
Aigoo, you should try a little harder.
How is it?
Is it good?
Yes.
Yes, it's really good.
Really?
But, what kind of noodles are these?
Nutrient filled noodles for you youngsters busy working and studying.
It's is especially made for you girls by So Pal Bok Noodles, and it's called Sam Gye Chi Jak Chopped Noodles.
It's a delicacy mixed with the world's best samgyetang and chopped noodles.
Sir, can I have one more bowl please?
But dad...
Huh?
I do not see Joon Gu.
That kid has recently fallen in love with the art of cooking.
He's gone to the market to go personally pick and choose his own ingredients.
Is that really our Bong Joon Gu?
That's really different from back when he was in High School
Did you guys hear?
About what?
Our high school reunion thing?
Reunion?
They have a dress code with a theme of school look.
I heard it too.
I heard.
But I am in trouble, because all my uniforms have gotten smaller because I've gained weight.
I do not know whose idea it is, but I love it.
Our memorable uniforms...
Seung Jo looked good in his uniform.
Especially the winter uniforms.
Baek Seung Jo again?
You heard about it?
What?
That there's a high school reunion, and the dress code is our old uniforms.
Isn't that a fun idea?
Who gave such a childish idea?
I heard it and I do not have any interest in it.
Still,
I am already excited about meeting my old school mates.
Are not you curious about how they are doing?
If you are interested then go.
Really that brat...
I just can not figure out what he is thinking.
Seung Jo said he would not go?
Yes...
Yes, he said it was childish.
Why is he like that?
I totally miss those youthful days.
I had a blind date at a dduk bok gi stand in front of the school.
Omo!
The Ddukbokki in that restaurant is really good!
Many school kids go there.
What was I talking about?
Blind dating!
Aah blind dating!
It was blind dating! Until I ate the whole plate, that male student could not bring himself to say a word.
So I told him to have some.
He was like "Yes!" and started gulping down all the water.
You were only in high school?!
Yes.
Yes, I am talking about your dad!
Student Baek Soo Chang!
Back then he was so cute!
For me, I can not forget how Seung Jo looked at graduation night when he did his speech!
I am going to have fun and I am going to be happy.
I am going to live like that.
Everybody, where ever you going to be, live having fun.
Omo, Ha Ni!
I have thought of a good idea that would make Seung Jo want to attend the high school reunion.
Really?
What is that smell?
Oh my!
What to do?!
Mhm!
What is it?
Ahh.. heh &lt;I&gt;The thing that allowed me to meet Seung Jo in my dream &lt;i&gt;was the leaf.
But still, he did not give me an F mark.
Parang High School's 14th Graduating Class Reunion
You have become much prettier.
Where are you going? &lt;i&gt;Did Seung Jo come?
Ha Ni!
Why are you so late?
Yeah!
You do not even answer your cell phone!
My mother told me to leave my cell phone at home.
Hand phone?
Why?
I do not know.
I think she has something planned.
But, it's strange coming here wearing our school uniforms.
Yeah?
Why?
Is not it thrillng and fun as if we are ditching, which we never got to do in high school?
You never ditched?
I said I never was able to do it wearing my uniform.
Hmm...
Hey, what about Joon Gu?
Ah, there was a group reservation at the restaurant, so he could not come.
Oooo he is a real chef now?
Seriously.
But...
Seung Jo... did not come?
Aigoo!
If you are here to see Seung Jo, then why did not you search for him already?
He is already here. Over there.
He looks completely uncomfortable.
Oh!
He is here!
Then I am only going to greet him for a bit.
Only greet him?
You said you would not come, but you did.
Why did you leave home without your cell phone?
Huh?
That...
Mother had to quickly leave for Busan to meet her family and you left your keys at home.
She told me to give them to you, so I came.
Is that so?
I did not...
Ah.. sorry. Looks like you went out of your way because of me.
Thank you. Without you I would not have been able to enter the house tonight.
Well since you are here, spend some time with friends.
No need.
Baek Seung Jo where you going? Sit down, Sit down. It's been really a long time.
It probably wasn't easy accepting her as a girlfriend. Girlfriends? How bothersome.
I see, so Class 7's Oh Ha Ni.
But Baek Seung Jo, what's your major?
There's no such thing. I'm undecided.
You mean you still haven't decided on a major?
Not yet.
You can inherit your father's company.
Isn't the Chairman's position just waiting for you?
Parang High's best band!
Taking over the Hong Dae indie band scene...
Annyong Bada! &lt;i&gt;Brought to you by PKer team @ www.viikii.net
It must have been fun seeing his friends after such a long time, &lt;i&gt;but he left without a word.
Is he sick?
Seung Jo , I...
I would like it if you would take over my gaming company.
At first as my reliable right-hand man, and later on I would like it if you could take the company in a new direction with your own abilities.
If you wanted, you could easily become a doctor.
So kids like Nu Ri...
I think it would be nice if you became a doctor that fixed the illnesses for many people all around the world.
You forgot this.
Thanks.
May I have a seat?
As you wish.
Thank you.
Are you worried about something?
Tell me.
Don't they say sharing worries could halve them and sharing your happiness will double it?
I will help you.
When I'm worrying about something, or if something good happens, I let Min Ah and Ju Ri know.
Once I do that, it feels like a weight has been lifted off my shoulders.
Then again, sometimes I tell them too much and that becomes a problem.
I'm going to go into the medical field.
I'm going to apply to the med program.
Though I don't know whether or not it's a good match for me, for the first time I've found something I'm interested in.
Seung Jo ah..
Don't tell anyone about it yet.
Especially my parents.
Don't go around spreading rumors all over the place either.
Do you understand?
Of course...
Why would I spread rumors?
Omo!
Then am I the only one who knows that?!
Well, members of the tennis club,
I have some really good news to tell you.
Next week is the 10th year anniversary of our Top Spin tennis club!
So we're thinking of bringing together all the past and current members to host a really great big party.
What do you think?
Aren't you excited!?
Next week is a holiday, so do you think Hae Ra will come?
I got it cheaply because of the holidays.
On top of that, a party with past and current members?
I don't even think I want to go.
Really?
Then should I take that part out?
I think if you could just get Seung Jo to come somehow, Hae Ra will just come automatically.
That's right! This is why you have the right to be the captain!
Seung Jo...Hae Ra... That's right!
Then I need to go ask for Ha Ni's advice. &lt;i&gt;So this is the medical department that Seung Jo is trying to get into. &lt;i&gt;I hear it's totally busy here. &lt;i&gt;Doesn't that mean it'll be even harder to see Seung Jo?
Ha Ni!
I've been looking for you everywhere.
Sunbae!
Sunbae, what are you doing here?
What about you?
At the medical department...
I mean I came looking for you.
I'm here because of Seung Jo...
Seung Jo?
What about him?
Anyway, why did you come all this way searching for me?
It's nothing big, but next week is our Top Spin's 10th year anniversary.
So I'm planning a party.
Planning a party?
So why are you telling me...
Listen!
For this party, if Seung Jo doesn't show up it becomes a real problem.
Senior, don't tell me you're trying to use Seung Jo again to get to Hae Ra.
You're not trying to use my Seung Jo as bait are you?!
Stop using that method now!
If you're not careful things might just turn for you.
I think you meant turn against you.
Anyways, forcing Seung Jo and Hae Ra together does us absolutely no good.
I know...
I know, I know, but if not for this method I will miss the chance to confess to Hae Ra.
I need Seung Jo, so Han Ni, why don't you...
It's Seung jo!
It's Seung Jo.
Ha Ni!
This is my last favor. I'm counting on you.
Do you understand?
I'm counting on you.
Were you following me?
No.
I really wanted to visit the medical department at least once.
I mean it may be the place you start attending.
But it's amazing here.
I guess all the people here are going to become doctors in the future.
There are some that don't.
But why did you come here?
It's not time to choose your major yet.
I came to meet a professor.
Why? To talk about what?
What would you know even if I told you?
Omo, don't look down on me.
Oh yeah, today Dad and Ahjushi went to get a check-up at the hospital.
I don't know how things turned out.
Want to go stop by the house with me later on?
What presents will those two bring back this time?
What do you mean present?
Cake?..
Today is your birthday?
Idiot, I mean an illness.
I want coffee.
Not for you.
I'm absolutely sick and tired of hospitals now.
So how was it? What about the results?
Here it is.
Show me.
Health Examination Results
I can barely understand it.
Induced...
Blood sugar...
It's a cardiac stress test.
It's to check for cardiac infarction or angina.
Let me have a look.
Your blood pressure is high.
Your heart rate is high too.
You've got a bit of cardiac stress.
Your cholesterol is high too.
Father, you have to watch out for your heart.
I heard the exact same thing from the doctor.
Honey, you should be healthy.
You need to think of your family.
Hey, Seung Jo.
How are you so good at it?
It's filled with cryptic words!
Though you're my son, you really amaze me.
Hyung could become a doctor too, since he's a genius.
Baek Eun Jo.
Being a genius isn't the only good thing to be.
Honey from now on you're banned from all things sweet and oily things.
Then what do I eat?
Dad!
You came.
Did something happen?
Yes?
He used to come running out screaming "Ha Ni" whenever you came.
But he's pretty uncaring lately.
Joon Gu?
Why?
What is he doing?
Hey.
Over there.
Take a look into the kitchen.
Today was the first time Joon Gu made a dish presented to a customer.
What?
Already?
Then does that mean Joon Gu is going to become a chef?
Well, he needs a bit more work with the foods presented to the customers.
That's right.
He may look that way, but his cooking abilities aren't bad at all. And he tries really hard too.
Hey.
Let's watch him
Joon Gu..
I just thought he was messing around everyday.
But I need to look again.
True.
See how hard working he is.
It's a bit early but he should do alright. But he's actually quite good.
He wanted to show you first.
Isn't he commendable? &lt;i&gt;It's my first time to see him like that. &lt;i&gt; He doesn't even know that I've come in.
Here.
It looks delicious.
Ha Ni, here.
Eat well.
Yeah.
I will eat well.
How is it?
Hey!
Success!
It's really delicious, Joon Gu ah.
For real?
Yeah.
It's very delicious!
It's the best!
Ha Ni.
If I cooked something well, I wanted you to be the first to taste it.
Wait a moment.
Here.
Try out this dumpling cut noodles.
It's got 3 colored dumplings of green, red, and yellow and the chewy noodles are incredible!
If you try it, you'll definitely like it!
Joon Gu ah..
Eat a lot.
Now even I've found something I'm confident in.
There is more.
Wait a second.
Today I saw a new side of Joon Gu.
I had always ignored him but
I'm sorry, Joon Gu ah.
Are you.... waiting for someone?
You're not going to sit?
Are you going to go to the 10 year anniversary for the tennis club this week?
Why? Are you curious?
It's pertaining to the club and there are going to be a lot of Sunbaes coming, so if possible it would be nice if lots of people attended.
I'm not really interested in a meeting where people gather saying things they don't really mean.
Oh!
Why don't you go and enjoy it for me?
That should do it.
Do you have anything else to tell me?
Yes? Well..
I'm curious about something.
We already talked about the 10 year anniversary.
What is it?
Well.
You're undecided on your major, so have you picked one yet?
You're acting funny today.
Why are you curious about my major?
It's just...
To be honest ,you could go anywhere you please as long as you want to, right?
So.. So.. By any chance,
I was wondering if you were going to follow in the foot steps of Seung Jo.
Why do you think about these things?
You're really an idiot.
Just because the person you like is going, doesn't mean you have to go to hell with them too.
Though I'm interested in Seung Jo, I don't care about the major he chooses.
I... will do as I wish, because it's my life.
You don't always have to be together to date.
Unnie will leave now.
See you.
She always ends it like that!
Well.. thinking that way is pretty cool.
Acknowledged.
Pay attention to what you're doing.
What are you doing?
If you're going, leave.
If you're staying, sit.
Joon Gu is still working hard to become a chef. And Hae Ra has things to do.
Is that what you mean? o?
Even Eun Jo seems to be worrying about his future.
And you have nothing?
Yeah.
I envy you.
Your carelessness.
I, too... have a dream. But.. what?
Something you want to do with me?
Tell me... about your dream.
I'll hear you out.
You know...
Seung Jo you're the doctor for a small village and I'm the nurse that helps you.
You're famous so you're always at the hospital.
It's not a big hospital like the university ones, but still, I try my hardest to help you.
Like attending to a crying child or something.
But.. there's a problem within that dream.
For example, if you say you want to become a pilot, then I want to become a stewardess. And if you say you want to become a pro golfer, then I want to become a caddy. In the end... my dream is simple and does whatever it pleases.
I.. am just moving in the direction of Baek Seung Jo, who is at the center of it.
There exists no such thing as myself.
It's exactly as you said.
But when I decided to become a doctor, I thought about it a lot too.
So what?
Even an unrealistic dream like that... A dream is still a dream.
It fits you.
Hey!
Is it really that unrealistic? Do you really think you could become a nurse just because I'm going to be a doctor?
Then again a dream the harder it is to attain . . . the more you want to try it out.
Right? &lt;i&gt;Dad&lt;/i&gt; Have a seat over there. Today someone from the university, a medical professor, contacted me.
Seung Jo, what I am saying, my dream is. . . I have decided to become a doctor. Even if you say anything, it will be of no use.
Ha Ni.
Seung Jo, &lt;Br&gt; you go as well. Will you be okay? I'm alright.
Sunbaenim, aren't you going to eat? We'll see.
Sunbaenim, you should eat.
Hae Ra.
Sunbae. You didn't come to the 10 year anniversary party. I never said I was going.
[No visitors allowed] That was a close one. There's not many days left until the game is released.
Seung Jo. I'm still young and have no experience, but I'll take care of the company until Dad's health gets better. Thank you Seung Jo.
Ha Ni I'm going to go to the hospital. Will it be okay, that I'm leaving everything to you? Yes, don't worry.
Ha Ni this is your chance when there's no one to interfere! Try experiencing what it feels like to be on your honeymoon! Aigoo, you arrived?
Did you see him smile?
Ah, it's Yon-sama!
They say his IQ is 200.
Aigoo, he's not going to fire me because I'm old right?
You should get ready.
Here are the documents regarding our company as well as new games.
Please look over this material.
Should we have the meeting around 11? There's quite a lot.
Is that so?
I'll try to read it fast.
Yes.
Then...
Manager.
Yes?
When we're together, please speak comfortably.
Oh no, you are here as the interim CEO.
Then, I will be leaving. Manager, he didn't talk about restructuring right?
Does he have a girlfriend?
Is he dating anyone?
- Are we going to get fired?
- How was he?
Aigoo, do not worry about other people is business and just focus on your work.
- It's because we are worried!
- Get back to work!
No, have you looked through all those documents?
This is the data that is compared to last year's data?
Yes, that's correct.
It looks like the profit has dropped significantly this year.
I think we may have been affected by the large scale push by international gaming companies.
Simply put, at this state, we are in a dangerous stage. To add to that, the new game that was supposed to launch is gone as well. We're on thin ice.
If we continue like this it'll be an operational crisis.
We're in a situation where even a merger is impossible.
Without some major support we may just...
Eun Jo, you're really hungry, right?
It'll be done in a few minutes.
Let's just order...
What are you talking about?
Restaurant food is high in calories.
With oil and salt, you don't know how much they put in it.
And on top of that, they don't put much vegetables.
I got it, alright!
Hurry up!
Next time, don't pretend like you know everything.
Why don't you studying cooking?
Oh.
What do I do?
What are you going to do if you get both me and Hyung sick too?!
Seung Jo has arrived. You did well.
Are you very tired?
Hurry and change your clothing.
Shower?
What are you doing?
I am taking off your jacket.
Why are you doing that?
What do you mean?
She is acting like a new bride.
What are you saying?
Ahjusshi is at the hospital.
How could I be thinking such indecent thoughts?
You really are an indecent person.
Go get changed quickly!
Today's menu is seasoned taro, grilled mackerel, and bean paste stew.
Eun Jo, eat it.
Here.
Oh gosh it's salty.
Did you pour in the whole bottle of salt?!
Hyung, this does not taste good.
So, I suggest that you do not eat this.
That sound...
The taro.
Taro makes a sound like that?
It's not fully cooked Hyung!
Hurry and spit it out!
Do not force yourself.
He swallowed it.
Hyung, you'll get a stomach ache!
Baek Eun Jo, do not just complain.
Hurry and eat it.
Eat it?
Which one?
Try poking it with your chopsticks and just eat the ones that are cooked. &lt;i&gt; Even with a horrible meal, &lt;i&gt; Seung Jo did not complain even once and just ate it.
Oh, Ha Ni!
It's Ha Ni?
What, packed lunch?
Why would you need to pack a lunch?!
Ah, Ha Ni's making packed lunch?
How in the world could she do such a thing with such soft hands?!
You're going to what?!
I'm on the phone!
Yes, okay.
Seung Jo and Eun Jo's lunches.
Oh. Egg rolls?
- Egg rolls?
- Egg rolls?!
How can you not be able to make something that easy?!
Our Ha Ni is making Baek Seung Jo's lunch?
You're out already.
Did you grab your handkerchief?
What about your wallet?
I have it.
Here.
Take this.
What is it?
What do you mean?
It's lunch.
I'm going to eat at the cafeteria, so it's fine.
No, don't eat that stuff.
I woke up at the break of dawn and prepared this.
The egg rolls are the point.
When you open it, you'll be totally surprised.
See you! See you.
You probably want to call him "hubby!"
What are you talking about?
Ahjushi is ill.
That's so indecent.
New bride Ha Ni, a nickname given to yourself.
I, too, will see you later.
Goodness that youngster just says the darnest things.
Do a good job!
Ha Ni!
Oh.
Come with me for a second.
Oh, I have class...
It'll just take a second.
Is it true that Seung Jo's father has been hospitalized?
That...
But you can't visit him!
He needs to be stabilized.
Visitors are prohibited.
How's Seung Jo doing?
I am assuming Seung Jo is not allowed to visit either, right?
He is currently working at Ahjushi's company.
That's why I have not been able to see him.
Thanks.
Yes?
Are you eating lunch?
Yes. Why don't you join me?
No.
It's okay.
Enjoy.
It's a packed lunch.
Did your girlfriend prepare that?
What?
Well then, I'll come back after lunch.
Yes.
Alright, a delivery of a special lunch box!
Oh, hey, hey!
Do not eat that.
Bong Joon Gu.
What are you doing?
I can not allow you to eat lunch that Ha Ni packed for you.
Instead, you... eat this. Grilled eel?
From now on, I will come to this company everyday for the packed lunch Ha Ni made.
I won't leave you alone if you eat the lunch. Ha Ni's packed lunch is for me.
Well then, thank you.
You did not poison this did you?
I do not play with fresh food!
I'll enjoy.
Do not waste any of the eel and eat it all up.
Let's take a look.
It's not bad.
Seeing Ha Ni's heart for Baek Seung Jo,
My heart is ripping apart.
But then again, I get to try out the lunch that Ha Ni made.
Alright.
Let's try this.
Ha Ni, I'm going to relish this.
Oh Ha Ni, do you truthfully dislike Baek Seung Jo?
How can you possibly feed him this?!
But still, Ha Ni made it so I need to eat it.
Oh, I don't think I can eat this. &lt;i&gt;Brought to you by PKer team @ www.viikii.net
What are you doing this late at night without the lights turned on?
I am thinking.
What's the matter?
What's bothering you?
I can help...
Probably not, right?
Then, I am going to sleep first.
Father's not doing well.
Huh?
He might need surgery
Heart surgery?
That's such a big surgery.
I might need to continue working at my father's company for the time being.
It's just too much for father to handle.
Then, what about getting into medical school?
There is no reason that I have to go there.
There is. This is the first time, is not it, that you wanted to do something, your dream.
It's not much of a dream.
Though I was smitten by it for a bit.
But once I do get into it...
I do not know how it's going to be.
Is it fun working at the company?
No, it's not.
Then, what should we do?
You said that you are gg to live an enjoyable life at graduation day.
You promised in front of all those people.
I am not in the least bit interested but if I work at the company, my father will be happy.
Then at least, it is a half successful life.
I am not interesed but if others are happy...
What can you do?
What to do?
Really?
Baek Seung Jo?
Seeing he stopped by the student administration offices.
It seems like Seung Jo is planning to take over his father's company.
I thought that if it were Seung Jo, would not do that
His father's condition does noto be good.
How do you know that . . .
Oh my, is that something to be surprised about ?
It's something you can figure out if you put your mind to it.
Especially how Seung Jo must be feeling right now.
I see that he is taken a leave of absence.
I understand.
What?
What do you know about Seung Jo?
I'm thinking about how to help him, that's why I said that.
What can you do ...
Oh Ha Ni...
How are you helping Seung Jo right now when he's going through such a tough time?
Following him around everywhere and getting in his way, or whining, and telling him it's fine and that it's all going to get better...
Comforting him like that?
Right.
You should at least do that.
Because those are the only things that Oh Ha Ni could ever do for Baek Seung Jo.
I'm going.
Living in the 21st century and playing a 2D game is a bit boring, but to play a different game, I mean there aren't many good games.
And when we do it's not that exciting.
Let's use the strategy of turning all the negatives into positives.
I think it would be nice if we create a game that's approachable, graphically appealing, and in 3D.
I heard your IQ was 200, I see you really are a genius.
It's not like that.
You just aren't utilizing your thoughts to their fullest.
Your brains are just a bit rusty because you haven't used them.
Now, shall we start deciding on the name of the game?
Rusty...
Rusty...
Rusty?
Rusty?
That's great.
See, see?!
Wow, it's great.
Let's up the skills, actions, and combos.
Yes that's right.
The importance of the main character...
This is where it gets fun.
Mother, did something happen?
What would happen?
There is nothing.
I just came to pick up some clothes.
Oh I thought...
Ha Ni, thank you, for filling in my empty place.
It's nothing.
It's something I have to do.
Even so, I'm really relieved.
Seung Jo is taking care of his father's company, and you are taking care of the house,
I feel much more at ease.
Seung Jo goes out to work early in the morning, and keeps working hard until late at night.
Is that so?
Really?
It must be hard.
Ha Ni, are you doing okay?
You have to go to school and do the housework.
Of course I have to do it.
Ah, but, Mother.
What?
Do you have something to tell me?
I have something to discuss with you.
What?
I'm going to be late, I'm going to be late.
Where are you going?
Seung Jo. Can you give me a ride today?
Where are you going?
To the same place as you are.
The same place?
No way!
You. . .
I got the approval to work part time at your father's company.
Please take care of me.
Oh Ha Ni this Mr. Kim.
Hello.
My name is Oh Ha Ni.
Oh, hello!
Everyone, she came in as a new employee.
Say hello.
Hello.
I'm Oh Ha Ni.
I will work hard!
Applause.
If you all look after me, I will work hard.
So please take care of me.
Our investor, President Yoon, is waiting downstairs.
Baek Su Chan was always busy bragging about his son, but I see it was all true.
Not at all.
You're too kind.
All right.
How is your father doing in the hospital?
He is getting better, but we thought this was an opportunity for him to take a break.
I guess I'll have to help a bit too.
Yes.
Please do.
Good.
President Yoon this is a document regarding the game we're currently developing.
Oh, I've already read it.
The game's name is "Rusty", right?
Yes.
The idea of the game is very fresh.
Thank you so much.
With an heir like you, I'm sure Baek Su Chang feels relieved.
You've got to make it into an even bigger company than what it is right now.
We've got to get past this hurdle and then think about that.
You have waited for a long time.
It's coffee, right?
Oh right.
Seung Jo-goon, how old are you?
I am 20 years old.
Oh, you're still young.
Don't you have a girl friend?
I don't have one.
Why?
It seems that you are very popular.
Yes.
President Baek Seung Jo is really popular.
Oh.
But he doesn't pay any attention to them.
He enjoys reading and listens to mostly classic.
He's also so very good at tennis, at which he's won many matches.
His IQ is 200 too!
He also cooks as well as any chef!
He is all around perfect.
That is amazing.
Miss Oh Ha Ni...
Yes.
Would you leave now?
Yes, President Baek Seung Jo.
You came?
Oh, yes.
Do you have a second?
It seems meeting President Yoon was quite effective.
His employees came by and asked in detail about all the funds we need for the game.
Do you think they'll invest?
But that's...
The chairman has come to like you very much.
Yesterday, he called me and complimented you a lot.
The chairman has a grand-daughter.
He asked me if you could meet with her sometime.
Are you talking about something like an arranged date?
Oh. Yes.
He was saying how it would be a waste to marry off his grand daugther to just anyone.
For our company, we're at a state where we need President Yoon's help.
I was a bit flustterd with his sudden comment.
How should I respond?
Oh!
You're here early.
Huh?
The stuff!
Thank you.
Let's have Bulgogi today.
Lots and lots.
You seem tired these days so I have to pamper you.
And then everything that's giving you a hard time will all go away.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Oh, you arrived Seung Jo-goon.
Hello, Baek Seung Jo. &lt;i&gt;Brought to you by the PKer team @ www.viikii.net
If you had to choose a son in law... who would you choose?
But still, it seems Seung Jo wasn't thinking about it at all.
you know comrades i'm the best in here if it not for me, those activists can be easily reported they can easily identify who uses us you're so conceited with such small a thing
i can be used to hang those activists without me, they can break away and escape immediately stop it i am really the favorite tool to use by our masters---the police and the soldiers and their agents with the pull of a trigger... the job is done
&lt;i&gt;Brought to you by the PKer team @ www.viikii.net
Episode 13.
You arrived, Seung Jo-goon.
Hi, Baek Seung Jo.
Sit down.
You don't have to be that surprised. I was surprised too when I heard you were my prospective marriage partner.
"I would never have a marriage meeting"
I was positive there would be no way I would marry a man my grandpa picked out for me.
Because of you, now I look funny.
I, too, had no idea that Hae Ra and you knew each other.
Yes, we go to the same school and are the same year.
We're friends.
I did think it was weird that I got her to come out so easily.
But it seems there is a destiny between you and Hae Ra.
Then, let's have something to eat first.
Ah, yes.
Hae Ra, choose something delicious to eat.
Yes, Grandfather.
Seung Jo you also choose what you like.
Yes.
Oh, Seung Jo doesn't really like oily food.
What do you think about this set meal?
It doesn't seem to be too much food either.
That sounds good.
Aigoo, you already get along well just like a married couple.
I'm sorry if I have made you uncomfortable.
I will be leaving early.
What's the matter?
Do you have something else to do?
Do you think this grandfather doesn't have any sense?
Baek Seung Jo!
Hey, Seung Jo!
Mother.
Ha Ni, where is Seung Jo?
He went out.
He went out?
He said he had an appointment, dressed well, and went out.
But why?
You were surprised right?
Yeah...
A bit.
You seem to have delighted my grandpa.
That was the first time he brought a picture and told me to take a look at a guy.
Of course at first, I didn't even look.
But then he said that he was the heir of a successful game company.
And when I saw the picture it was really you!
But how can I not go when it's you?
And it would be so much fun?!
I wanted to see your expression.
How was it?
Your expression was... bitter
So, what do we do next?
If we want to be funded by your grandfather...
Does that mean I need to get married?
With you?
Well, that's possible too.
But you wouldn't like that, right?
Wouldn't you be the one to not like it?
Hey!
What are you doing acting like a kid?
Do you have a handkerchief?
I don't.
In the condition we're in now, a game can't be released.
We're even behind on employees' salaries.
That's why I came out today.
But, since you're the other person, I'm actually relieved.
But don't you dislike it?
Since it's for that reason?
I didn't know these kind of words can come out of Baek Seung Jo's mouth.
Really?
Living is pretty extreme.
It's no joke.
But, I came out because it was you.
You came and you were relieved that it was me, but I came because it was you, even though I knew why you came.
Hey, since I knew the real reason, my pride was hurt so I did actually say that I didn't want to come.
But when this morning came around, I wanted to come out looking pretty.
Doesn't it seem like I really like you?
But don't worry.
Even though the situation seems real, I don't want to go that far.
Let's just take a chance... on each other.
Let's try it out...
Okay, it's good.
Really?
Really?!
It's alright.
Be strong.
Right now those people are probably just seeing his fright.
But once they see his true colors, they'll probably say no first.
He's not humane, he's no fun, and he's not good to the ladies.
How is Seung Jo's dad doing lately?
He is getting better.
I'm back.
Let's talk for a bit Baek Seung Jo.
Aren't you going to Father at the hospital?
Just go.
We'll talk next time.
Aigoo, look at that brat.
Who would like someone that cold?
You're probably the only person that can handle that temper of his.
Be strong, okay?
You came back early.
Yeah...
I can't?
Excuse me...
You had a marriage meeting?
Yeah.
How was it?
Did you hear who it was with?
Hae Ra.
I heard it was the granddaughter of Windy Media.
Yeah.
Pretty perfect, isn't it?
Will you... get married?
Get married?
Probably.
Marriage naturally follows a marriage meeting.
Ha Ni!
Oh!
Ha Ni!
What happened now?
I guess something happened again.
Ha Ni, why do you look so down again?
Was Baek Seung Jo mean to you again?
Did you get kicked out of Seung Jo's company?
I said I was sick and that I was going to take a day off today.
So, you're really sick?
You should go to the hospital if you're sick.
Why did you come to school?
It hurts here.
Why?
It's because there's going to be a marriage .
Marriage?
Who?
With who?!
Maybe... Baek Seung Jo?!
Who's the other person?
Yoon Hae Ra.
What?
Yoon Hae Ra?!
Why suddenly with Yoon Hae Ra?
It was a marriage meeting.
One of the big investors of the company, she's his granddaughter.
Oh my goodness.
Yoon Hae Ra is no ordinary girl.
Hey...
So are they going to get married?
He said he likes the idea.
It's the first time I heard Seung Jo say something like that.
Hey!
That's good then!
Now, you can completely forget someone like Baek Seung Jo.
And you can meet a good guy.
Excuse me, President.
How did the meeting go with the chairman's granddaughter?
Fine.
I heard that you two already knew each other.
Yes, that's true.
President Yoon seems to like you quite a lot as a groom.
Is the Powerpoint tutorial going well?
Oh yes, we're working on it right now.
Ah, yes.
Fighting. &lt;i&gt;Acting like a girlfriend...
You've got a text. &lt;i&gt;Looks like you're taking a leave of absence.
Hello!
Really delicious.
Really!
Did you make it all by yourself?
Of course.
I made the soup base on my own, and made the noddles too!
This whole bowl I made all with my power.
How did you already...
You're amazing Bong Joon Gu.
I wanted to let you have the first noodles that I made.
Before I started working, I washed my hands throughly and prepared my heart.
I put all my passion into it.
What am I that you'd go that far for me?
What do you mean what are you?
If it wasn't for you, I wouldn't even wash my face.
It's really true.
Since I never know when you're coming, I dress nicely, wash my hair everday, and work hard at learning how to cook.
To put it in one sentence, Ha Ni, you are the reason that I live.
Thank you.
Since you're saying that to me, I feel like a special person.
And this is really delicious.
You're really cool.
You did well Bong Joon Gu.
Really?
If you think that, we should go on a date sometime..
It would be good to go on a date...
Ok, let's do it.
Let's go on a date.
Re..really?
Rea... Really?
For real?
Date, date.
Ha Ni, thank you!
When will we go on one?
When will we go on the date?
Where is Ha Ni?
She is going on a date.
Date?
She really dolled herself up before leaving.
A red coat, and red shoes.
She went out completely in red.
Really?
Sounds like she went with a guy with strange tastes.
Ha Ni! &lt;BR&gt; Here, here!
Did you come early?
No, it has been about 3 hours?
What?
Did I get the time wrong?
No, it's not that.
At home, I kept looking at the clock but it felt like it wasn't moving.
So I just came.
I see.
You really came.
I'm so touched that I feel like I'm going to die.
Ha Ni is very pretty today.
Where are we going now?
First, the basics of a date...
Let's watch a movie first.
It was a wish of mine to watch a movie with you.
I did too...
Oh, I really wanted to see this movie.
Is that right?
I thought so that's why I got it.
Let's go in.
You want some popcorn?
Here's the Giant Combo.
Let's go! &lt;i&gt;My beating heart &lt;i&gt;Is a mess like my room &lt;i&gt;I just can't get a hold of it
Take this.
How is it?
It's delicious.
How is it? &lt;i&gt;For your own sake, forget all about me &lt;i&gt;I will call you, you &lt;i&gt;I wish to marry you &lt;i&gt;I wish to kiss you &lt;i&gt;I wish to steal your heart
-Should I put it in (your hair?) -I don't want it.
It's pretty, why not?
Do you want to take a picture?
- Watch, watch!
- Hey!
Hey!
I'm sorry, but can you take one picture for us?
-Hey!
-Here.
-You do it too, you do it too. &lt;BR&gt; -Okay okay. &lt;i&gt;My beating heart &lt;i&gt;Like my messy room
Marriage?
Yes.
I found out that the both of them got into Parang University ranked 1st or 2nd in their schools.
During some point in high school,
I heard that they met once at a tennis tournament.
Yes.
It's a match made in heaven isn't it?!
If that's why you think so, then every couple is a match made in heaven!
For a couple to be a match made in--
But this goes for both Seung Jo and Hae Ra.
Maybe after they finish their studies--
Can they not study after they get married?
I'm thinking it might be nice if they study abroad.
If those two get married think about how talented their children would be?
Doing business and all, I've learned that people are the most important factor.
One smart person can do the work of 100 people.
Chairman Baek, no need to worry about money now.
Just carry on with your company.
Yes. &lt;i&gt; Brought to you by the PKer team @ www.viikii.net&lt;/i&gt;
Baek Seung Jo!
Yoon Hae Ra!
Laugh while you can!
After today, living will suck.
It's very entertaining.
Keep going.
Ah, I'm so full.
I was going to buy dinner.
What are you talking about?
The man usually pays for the meals.
Today was fun.
The movie was fun as well.
I also had a great time.
This is the best day of my life.
Ha Ni, your smiling face is the best thing in the world.
If I got to see your smiling face everyday, I'd probably be full even if I didn't eat.
Why?
Is there something on my face?
Then, am I being strange?
Thank you.
Ha Ni.
You really are a good person.
I already knew... but I really feel it these days.
Ha Ni, have you ever been to the Han river?
I haven't been there at night.
I haven't been there since I came up from Busan.
Do you want to go?
Okay.
Wah!
The Han River is so pretty!
It is.
Your mind is everywhere these days, isn't it?
Is the game development going okay?
My grandpa said that the idea was really good.
It's just okay.
I'm going to go at it like a blue frog.
Blue frog?
Since everyone is always saying 3D, 3D, I'm planning to do something different from 3D.
Like an animation.
That's great.
Everyone's always talking about how to make a game more realistic, An animation type of game .
That's contrarian.
That's exactly it.
Contrarian.
Taking the game's weakest point and making it into the strongest.
I'm thinking about making it look like an animation.
There was a reason that my Grandpa was so interested.
He's really into you.
Do you want to go to a jazz bar in a little bit?
Omo, omo.
Ha Ni, let's get going.
Wow, is this really the Han river?
It's really pretty.
Ha Ni, what's this lit up area?
It seems like it's a cafe.
Cafe?
Then, let's go inside the cafe.
Should we have a caramel macchiato?
Okay..
Really...
Let's go.
Let's go.
The cafe is really pretty.
This is the first time I've been someplace like this in my life.
If I didn't know you, I would have never come here.
These places come out on dramas.
Do you like it?
I really like today.
Ha Ni, aren't you cold?
You should have dressed warmly.
Oh, Baek Seung Jo
You're on a date?
Can you not see?
Hey looking at you two, it looks like you're having a good time too.
Yeah.
It's good.
Could it be that Seoul is that small?
How did we run into one another here?
I wonder...
Ah!
You wanna go together?
We're going to a jazz bar.
It's just a casual place.
Jazz?
What's wrong?
It'll be annoying for all of us.
You guys should go to some place like an arcade.
Isn't that more comfortable?
Hey, what are you implying?
We have ears too and we know how to listen to music as well.
That's right.
You know me quite well.
Let's go somewhere else, Joon Gu.
Sure.
Oh Ha Ni...
You look quite good together.
Really?
Does it really look that way?
You guys are a match made in heaven too!
You and your nasty personalities look perfect together!
Let's go.
Good bye!
Ha Ni...
What?
Ah...
Wow!
It's so pretty!
It's really pretty.
Thank you for bringing me here.
Marry me.
What?
What I'm saying is... marry me.
Why?
Do you not have hands?
You'd probably say that if I were Ha Ni.
Probably.
Why are you so mean to Ha Ni?
Well...
Oh, am I weird?
Why do I feel that it'd be nice if you were mean to me too? &lt;i&gt;Brought to you by the PKer team @ www.viikii.net
Will you... marry me?
Bong Joon Gu.
I look at you, and you look at Baek Seung Jo.
It's already been 4 years of that.
Of course... I can wait however long for you.
But, Baek Seung Jo... he's found someone else now.
Both looking at someone else's back like that... let's stop that now, Ha Ni.
All you have to do it is turn around.
If you just turn around...
I'm right here.
Joon Gu...
Let's get married,
Ha Ni.
He's late.
What is he doing right now?
Jazz bar.
It must be fun.
I'm thinking of Baek Seung Jo again.
You were home.
What time is it right now?!
11 o'clock.
What have you done until now?
You go to a marriage meeting without even telling us.
I heard you went on a date again.
What are you planning to do?
What are you doing right now?
He said he's fine, so what's wrong with you?
You don't have to do that.
Your father's fine.
I'm not doing it because of Father.
What a liar.
You're doing this for your father's company.
Me?
No way.
You really don't know your son?
Then, what's the reason to keep seeing President Yoon's granddaughter?
Are you really curious?
Because I like her.
What?!
That makes no sense.
That reason is enough right?
You...
Baek Seung Jo.
Welcome back.
You're late.
You came early.
You looked good together.
Yes, it was good.
It was fun, and he was nice.
Unlike someone, he wasn't mean to me.
I liked it.
That's good then.
Good luck to you.
What?
A proposal?
Bong Joon Gu is amazing.
Marriage?
So, what did you say?
What did you say?
I didn't say anything.
What is this?
I know that Joon Gu is a really good person, but still...
I don't have those feelings for him.
Even when I received that sudden proposal...
I was a little surprised.
But since it passed, I just calmed down.
Hey... where is there a person who thinks about you as much as Joon Gu?
Yeah.
Hey, honestly speaking, instead of Baek Seung Jo, you look much better with Bong Joon Gu.
Baek Seung Jo is getting married with Yoon Hae Ra.
Yeah, Ha Ni.
This time, think carefully about Bong Joon Gu.
He looked at only you for four years.
You probably know how Joon Gu feels, better than anyone.
You know what I'm saying right?
Okay.
Black?
- It's pretty.
- Ah, Seung Jo.
Which one is better?
The white one.
I think so too.
Should I wrap them together?
Please do it separately.
I'll pay for it.
Really?
Thank you.
Ah!
Then, I'll buy dinner.
I know of a few places. &lt;i&gt;The person that looks good with me&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;is not Baek Seung Jo,&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;and it could be Bong Joon Gu.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Even if I don't get excited, he's comfortable,&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;like family.&lt;/i&gt;
I see you again.
Are you shopping?
We're going to go eat dinner.
Really?
Do you want to come with us?
Oh...
Shall we?
Yes, let's go together.
Whatever you choose.
It's not like I'm begging you to come with us.
Yes, let's go together.
Are you going to look at those all day?
Oh, Chef!
I'm sorry.
Clean it up.
Yes!
Welco...
Welcome.
Dad.
Oh!
Ha Ni!
Hello.
Come in.
This place...Ha Ni, this is your...
Yeah.
Yeah that's right.
Oh Ha Ni and Bong Joon Gu...
This place has 60 years of tradition, So Pal Bok Noodles, which Oh Ha Ni and Bong Joon Gu will be taking on!
Ah, but you're friends?
Friends, Chef?
They're getting married.
Is that so?
Sit... sit down please.
I looked it up on the Internet and decided to come here.
Your restaurant is really pretty.
Ah, yes.
Wow pretty.
It's so pretty it feels like a waste to eat it.
Since this rascal came, our chef made something special.
Of course.
If it's Seung Jo and his friend, then they're VlP.
Please eat a lot.
Yes. I'll eat well.
Ah look at this, look at this.
You don't even know how to eat it.
With this Pyongyang Neng Myun... you put the vinegar right onto the noodles.
And after waiting a little bit for the noodles to soak up the vinegar... you pull them apart and eat them.
Ohhh.
Oh, it's like that.
I didn't know either.
Really?
Well it's okay to not know.
A lot of people don't.
Eat a lot!
Makes me look at him differently.
You must be happy, Oh Ha Ni.
Since your boyfriend knows a lot.
I can't use chopsticks very well.
You can't make fun of me for using them strangely.
Ha Ni.
What are you looking at like that?
Seung Jo's face will fall off. &lt;i&gt;Your Imagination Will Become A Game.
Your imagination will become a game.
We've portrayed many fun features for users within this game.
It's a stylish action with top notch visuals.
With the various missions systems, users can enjoy different levels of enjoyment through the game.
Especially because our games style concept differs from other games.
Action game...
That's the focus and the factor that will differentiate our game.
Then, I will show the demo version.
You have all just experienced the world of imagination.
Just like he said, it looks like an animated movie.
It must not have been easy, but you finished in a short time period.
It was due to the late nights that the employees worked.
-You worked hard.
-Goodbye.
You worked hard.
Should I ask Hae Ra to come out so that we can go eat somewhere?
I'm sorry.
Today is the day that my father gets discharged from the hospital, so I have to go home and eat dinner at home.
Ah is that so?
Then the timing is good!
I'll ask Hae Ra to go over there.
She needs to give her greetings now that he's out of the hospital.
Seung Jo, your mother came out.
-Hello.
-Yes.
Why are you here?
Come here.
I've met you once before.
I'm Yoon Hae Ra.
Oh is that so?
It seems like I've seen you before, but I guess your impression wasn't that great.
Ah!
You know that Ha Ni and Seung Jo are living together right?
Yes, of course.
Oh my, you bought cake.
He's (father) forbidden to eat anything sweet.
And Seung Jo doesn't like sweet things.
I bought it, so that you could eat it.
Oh, really?
These are rice cakes.
It's set to eat comfortably.
Please eat it once.
She is different from Oh Ha Ni.
What about rice cakes?
Even if it's simple, rice cakes are rice cakes.
Shall I eat cake?
Then please talk.
I should go in and lay down.
Me too.
Seung Jo.
He is my son, but Seung Jo has a very tiring temper.
He's self centered and naughty...
And he's no fun.
That's not true.
He is fun.
And he can converse well.
You too... must be a boring style.
You talk back well and only talk about things from books.
You must be like that?
Yes, you're right.
We're both rational and logical.
But even though people look at us like that, it's fun for us.
More than that, he is not good to women.
He doesn't say a single nice thing.
He's the type of person to fix someone's love letter and give it back.
Really?
I've done that before too.
Wow really?
You really did that before?
Yes.
You guys must be one of a kind.
Baek Seung Jo seems like he's smart, right?
But, he's dumb.
He doesn't know his own feelings.
If he likes someone, he's colder to them and hurts them more.
And he pushes them away.
That's what I see.
That means he's scared.
People's feelings... can't be solved easily like a math equation. that he might get caught.
Are you like that too?
Mother!
You're childish.
What?
Childish?
I won't say anything about you liking Oh Ha Ni.
But, why are you pushing me to like her as well?
Were my words wrong?
You are my son.
I know you.
But you don't know yourself.
Even if I don't, Let me do things the way I want.
Beak Seung Jo.
My career and even my love life.
Please stop your meddling.
Meddling?
I have always respected your decisions.
Isn't that so?
But what is this?
You obviously know Ha Ni's feelings and you still brought her to our house!
This is a problem with courtesy among people.
Are you a kid that doesn't have courtesy?
Mother,
I'm fine.
Now, please Would you stop this!
Baek Seung Jo, you!
Right.
Since you have always respected my decision, please do so this time as well. &lt;i&gt;Brought to you by the PKer team @ www.viikii.net
I thought that Seung Jo really liked Ha Ni.
Since he is my son I believed that he would eventually come to like her.
You can't control your kids like that.
But don't those two really suit each other well?
They fill the missing spots and share what they have too much of.
Isn't it really like that?
That's how I see it too, but Seung Jo is not going that way.
What to do?
I feel like I did something bad to both Seung Jo and Ha Ni.
He likes her.
What?
Hyung likes Oh Ha Ni.
So don't cry, Mom.
Eun Jo!
What are you talking about?
Baek Eun Jo!
Hyung...
Are you really going to get married to Hae Ra?
Isn't she pretty?
You like pretty Nunas.
Do you like that Nuna?
Won't it turn out like that, if we keep going on?
But still!
Still, the person you like is . . .
That nuna is a woman that suits me very well.
She is smart, and she can play tennis well too.
Hyung!
If you meet her for a couple more times, you'll definitely like her.
Liar.
Sleeping in a place like this... She's really carefree.
Right!
A bug on top of her hand?
Oh Ha Ni, you'll be surprised for sure.
Oh! &lt;i&gt; Then hyung went back to the pension.
So it was a dream! &lt;i&gt; H..hyung kissed Oh Ha Ni.
After doing that...
I saw everything.
But still I can't tell that to Mom.
Hyung is saying it isn't so.
But this is for sure.
Hyung likes Oh Ha Ni.
Is something going wrong?
No.
There isn't anything that's going well or anything that's going wrong
I'm just playing.
What is this, genius Yoon He Ra?
Should Grandpa put some speed into it? Put speed?
Yeah, we're the ones that pulled the knife.
He's the one that's supposed to be trying, not us.
I don't want it, Grandpa.
Scaring someone to make them do something, that hurts my pride more.
Really?
Then should Grandpa just stay still?
Yeah. For now.
If I really think there's nothing I can do, then I might ask you to use a knife.
Yeah. Don't hold it in.
I won't hold back.
Baek Eun Jo...
I made the pudding that you like!
Here!
Eat it.
Is it good?
That's a relief.
But, Eun Jo... what was that you told me before, about Seung Jo liking Ha Ni.
I'm not eating anymore.
Ah, why?
You're hiding something aren't you?
Come here!
Maybe because the weather is clear today, there are many stars in the sky.
Dad.
What do you think about me dating Joon Gu?
Joon Gu?
Why?
Did something happen?
No, I was just saying "What if"
What if that's the case.
What if?
Yeah, what if that's the case.
Well, who knows?!
I didn't like him much because he was rough on the edges and all...
He's like a man.
And when he cooks, he really focuses.
As a chef I think he's great.
And more than anything else, he really likes you Ha Ni.
He cares for you, so there's nothing not to like.
Is that so?
I guess Seung Jo's getting married?
Yes.
It's that girl who came to the restaurant?
I feel like I've made an unwise decision.
We shouldn't have moved back in no matter how much they tried to convince me.
You know.
If we stay here longer, it will get strange.
It'll get uncomfortable between people.
We won't even be able to talk.
Seung Jo...Well Oh Ha Ni was a really good lady.
Making me really think about it, it was a good opportunity.
Yeah.
There are many stars, right?
Oh, Joon Gu!
At the restaurant?
Why?
Today is your day off, isn't it?
What are you doing on your day-off alone?
I'm making a new menu Can you come by after school?
If you say it tastes good, then I want to officially present it to the chef.
You have to come, okay?
These little punks... What are you doing?!
Get up quickly!
Sunbae, can we not rest for a while?
What did you do so that you can rest?
Training does not stop.
Never stop!
It's supposed to rain tomorrow morning.
Are we doing this tomorrow too?
Huh?
You crazy jerk
Why would it rain on a day like this?!
I'll bet my life savings and my left hand that it doesn't rain!
Hurry and get up and stop with the nonsense.
Hurry!
You're the same.
Aigoo!
Hey!
Seung Jo!
It's really been a long time!
I've heard about your father.
Is he alright now?
Yes, he got through it.
Oh!
That's a relief!
What to do about this?
Since you don't come, the girls don't come as well.
Look at this!
It's full of men.
Aigoo really.
You came well.
Since you're here, let's play a game.
I came to clean out my locker today.
I don't think I'll be able to come for a while.
Something must be wrong with you.
What kind of freshman is that busy?
I don't see the ball boy today.
Ball boy?
Ahhh.
Ha Ni?
She's always skipping these days.
She must be busy dating that guy who works in the cafeteria.
These little punks!
What are you doing?!
Move it!
This is our school's tennis court.
Ah, the tennis court where Ha Ni suffered and got ignored a lot?
Yeah.
This is the place.
-Woah.
-It's good, huh?
Yeah pretty extreme.
Wow, oh.
Practicing...
Oh!
Baek Seung Jo!
Why are you here?
Shouldn't I be asking you that?
Ah.That's right.
Anyway, we heard you're getting married.
With Yoon Hae Ra?
Today, isn't Ha Ni meeting up with Bong Joon Gu?
Yeah!
Bong Joon Gu is making something really yummy for her.
Bong Joon Gu is so great!
I know!
Who knew he'd even ask her to marry him?
Is she responding today?
Ah, that's right!
That's why she dressed up so nicely.
Then won't Ha Ni be the first one to get married?
Ah I know!
So Pal Bok Noodles.
Eat more of this.
Ah, I'm full.
How can you be full already?
I prepared a lot.
Next time.
But these are really delicious.
Be sure to tell Dad.
It'll be a jackpot.
Is that so?
Drink this.
It's plum juice.
You'll digest nicely.
Joon Gu, you're really great.
It seems like your cooking skills have gotten better than my dad's.
Aigoo what are you talking about?
I still have a long way to go to be like Chef.
But since you're complimenting me, I do feel good.
My heart is beating.
It's raining really hard.
Here...
Ha Ni...
Huh?
What I said last time...
I didn't just say it.
Have you thought about it?
But... I...
A little more ti...
It still can't be?
I'm talking about Seung Jo.
He even went on a marriage meeting.
You can't get rid of your feelings yet?
No, more than that...
Ha Ni...
That cold and bad guy, what do you like so much about him?
I told you last time.
I'm a house.
Whenever you come, I'll be always there.
But if you let the house be empty for too long, you can't use it anymore.
Joon Gu...
Are you okay?
Ha Ni, are you okay?
Ha Ni, I really like you!
Joon Gu...
Ha Ni...
Joon Gu, don't do this.
Joon Gu!
Don't be like this.
No, don't do it.
I told you not to do it!
Joon Gu!
I guess... that it can't be me.
I'm sorry, Joon Gu. &lt;i&gt;I really am no good. &lt;i&gt;After making Joon Gu that hopeful, &lt;i&gt;he only ended up getting hurt. &lt;i&gt;What is this?
Did I make it so that if it's not Baek Seung Jo, it can't be anyone?
-What are you doing here?
-What do you mean?
Isn't it obvious?
There's no chance that you'd take an umbrella with you.
Then, were you waiting for me?
Are you coming from meeting that guy?
Which answer did you give him?
Huh?
I heard he asked you to marry him.
Why?
I can't do that?
That's why I ask, which answer you gave him.
Whatever I said to him, it's none of your business.
That's right.
I... am going to move out.
I've talked with my father about it.
I'm going to get in your way.
It's a relief that Joon Gu works so hard.
My dad likes him a lot too.
Now, I should help my father at his restaurant with Joon Gu.
Do you like him?
Bong Joon Gu?
Of course I do.
For 4 years, he only liked me.
If someone says they like you, then you just like them like that too?
Why?
I can't do that?
I'm tired of having a crush now.
I want to see a guy that likes me.
I like Joon Gu.
You ...
You like me.
You can't like anyone but me.
What is this, that confidence?
Am I not right?
Yes, you are right!
I only like you.
So what am I supposed to do?
You don't ever see me.
Someone like me...
Don't say that you like another guy.
That's the second one.
Second what?
Kiss.
It's the third.
It's fine. you don't have to count those things.
Okay. &lt;i&gt;Brought to you by the PKer team @ www.viikii.net &lt;i&gt;There are actually results from having a crush for four years. &lt;i&gt;Get in. &lt;i&gt;You finally did it. &lt;i&gt;Then what about Bong Joon Gu? &lt;i&gt;You're faster than I thought.
I knew that someday you'd find your true feelings. &lt;i&gt;But you're not having a hard time anymore? &lt;i&gt;I'm not. &lt;i&gt;It became fun. &lt;i&gt;Yoon Hae Ra, what's wrong with you?
I wanted to call you "Father."
I wanted to call you "Father-in-law." &lt;i&gt;Congratulations on your marriage. &lt;i&gt;I'm sorry.
Are you okay?
Yeah.
Even if you weren't okay, you're not the type who would tell me.
I'm really okay. Wait just a little.
This time, honestly, even if I have to leave my home, I'm going to protect you.
What are you saying?
The Witch's personality isn't the kind to sit back and do nothing. She's definitely up to something. I'm just saying that I'll be preparing, too.
Don't do that. what?
Whatever you do, you have to be the reason for it.
I don't want you protecting me.
Why do you not like it?
Because you're my girl, it's a given that I'd protect you. Someone protecting someone else; someone guarding over someone else...
If it's only sustainable by that... I don't like it.
Until now, I've already received so much from you, F4 sunbaes, even JaeKyung unnie.
At the very least, I want for you and I to be on equal footing. As I overcome what needs to be overcome.
Do you know?
What?
You're the type of girl on whom
"cuteness" is wasted.
Huh, what's wrong with you?
Chan!
(the boy's name) What's wrong?
Why are you so sad? What's wrong?
What?!
Is this the time to be laughing?
Hold it in.
You'd better hold it in!
Chan, what is that?
Can you see that?
You can't see it well, huh?
Let me ride on your shoulders, okay? what?
A shoulder ride. Is it fun?
Yeah.
He's going to fall. &lt;BR&gt;No, I'm not going to fall.
It must be spring . . . the weather's mellowed.
It's weird.
What is? I feel as though I'm in a vague dream that I've had before.
I'm just saying...
How come this small kid's so heavy!
Hey, Manager Jung. Young master, I think you'd better come back now. Madam Chairman will find you.
Happy birthday to you!
Happy birthday to you! Happy birthday to YiJung! Happy birthday to you!
Happy birthday, YiJung.
Come on, you should make a wish and blow out the candles.
This is a gift.
"One meeting, one opportunity " What does it mean? A once-in-a-lifetime fate.
GaEul.
YiJung sunbae... I found it. What?
Even knowing I was an idiot . . . She knew it better than anyone in the whole world.
How could she give me such a tough problem to solve?
YiJung.
I really would like for you to show up.
The breeze... can't go back to a place it has already left, YiJung.
Do it over!
Do it over!
Let me redo it!
Yesterday, the lovely spring weather brought out many families to the city zoo, where flowers were in full bloom.
Mr. President.
Are you serious about keeping this buried?
Even if they say it was an accident that a zealot committed?
It's not as though it would bring these two back to life.
I can't let JiHoo see his father and mother's death be used in political strife.
President.
I had no fear about something that I always believed was right.
But it wasn't until after I lost them that I realized that that was also a form of arrogance. . .
It was because of the fear that I might also lose you...
The years that I was unable to see you was my punishment.
When you should have been blaming your Grandfather, you had been living with that terrible burden.
Now, even if I die,
I have no regrets, child.
Can I ask that you take care of the Foundation and the clinic?
It was your father and mother's wish to cure the heart by the arts and to cure illness by medical practice
Grandfather, I'm not yet...
Come over here!
Spicy fish soup is ready!
He he, that kid sure has a loud voice.
You're going to chase away all the fish with that loud voice of yours!
Is it all done?
Yes.
How is it?
You rascal, know that I'll eat it because I don't want to waste the perfectly good fish.
JiHoo, why don't you taste it?
Amazingly, it tastes a lot like your mom's.
Ok, you two, look over here! one...two...three!
I have good news and bad news. Which one do you want to hear first? Ah, I know your style.
I don't know.
No, they will.
But, what's the good news?
Even with all that, the fact that I will continue.
I'm not going to avoid it anymore.
If you give up once, how much you regret it...
I learned thanks to you.
Sunbae.
GaEul, you want to try it? How did you know that I would listen bad news first? Because good girls like happy endings.
Yes, mom. What? Is that true?
Jandi, take a walk around. Okay. It's quite something, isn't it?
Yes, it's me. Hey, is that true? Who would have the nerve?
No! Whatever happens, we must take care of the foundation!
No!
Grandpa! Grandpa!
Grandpa! Grandpa!
Grandpa, your medicine! The medicine!
Sunbae! The hospital, the hospital!
He did not want you to know. He said he'd be fine as long as he's careful. Let's go and get Grandfather's stuff.
Chairwoman, Apart from anything else, could you reconsider about the Sooam Foundation?
You know better than anyone that I'm not doing this out of greed for the silly foundation. What are you intending to do?
I'm sorry about that. But... it's not like the ties are completely cut with JK Group. I will do my utmost to save it.
Yeah. I'll make that promise.
I won't lift a finger against Geum Jandi. In return don't forget what you've said just now. Don't worry.
Granny? Do you still not know your mother? This is not the time for you to feel at ease.
Granny!
Thank you.
*JiHoo in Kindergarten*
* JiHoo in elementary school *
JiHoo in college.
Gaeul Didn't you say your father had tenure of 20 years at his company? It hasn't even been that long since he was promoted to assistant manager.
Looks like it. I was wondering why she didn't do anything after the wedding. Then again it seems Jihoo has been put into a mess too.
JiHoo's? It seems Chairman Kang is going to take over Jihoo's foundation as well.
What? The development of the new art center in Song-do has already been postponed. Then...
This is all?
Her plan to destroy, the one, Geum JanDi.
Grandfather...
JanDi, glad you came. Why? Did you miss me in that short period of time?
JanDi, since you're here, why don't you take that boy out of here? He's completely stuck on me and won't move an inch. It's suffocating.
Get out of here now!
Let's get out of here. &lt;i&gt;The development of the new art center has already been postponed.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;So, this is . . .&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Her plan to destroy the one, Geum JanDi.&lt;/i&gt; The desire to protect someone, I never thought it would develop in me.
But since I met you, I started developing it.
Grandfather, the clinic, the foundation, And... you. &lt;i&gt;Now since Grandpa is with Sunbae, I'm really relieved. &lt;i&gt;Sunbae, you don't know that, right?
But sunbae, you were always like sunshine to me. &lt;i&gt; Goodbye, my fireman. A dandelion lives as a dandelion, while a horseweed lives as a horseweed. A plantain also lives as a plantain.
There were a lot of books I wanted to read to you.
I apologize. I... can endure hunger. And even being cold, I can endure.
But there is one thing... that I can never endure. It's seeing those that I love endure hardship because of me. It's not something that I can make better by trying harder.
Chairwoman,
Geum JanDi is here. She came here quicker than I expected. Let her in.
Hello, Miss. Oh, Jandi!
Hi!
Has everyone been doing well? But what's going on? Is it okay for you to be here?
Geum JanDi!
Fighting!
We're all on your side!
Hello Sunbae nim.
Welcome, Miss Geum JanDi. Why are you acting like that? It's me, Geum JanDi, your apprentice.
You're a guest when you come to this house now. But, what brings you here?
Ah..Goo JunPyo....
I mean Master JunPyo.... I came to see Goo JoonPyo. Young Master is in his room.
JunPyo, let's play!
Goo JunPyo, let's play! Now I'm even hearing Geum JanDi's voice.
Hey, what's going on?
Goo JoonPyo, let's play. Why are you here? Did that Witch do something again?
You're right. While we're on the subject, can I ask you for one more favor? What is it?
What's your offer?
What are you going to give me in return? If there's nothing as collateral, I don't have any desire to agree.
I'll leave.
I'll leave Goo JoonPyo.
I'll transfer schools and move.
I'll move to a place Goo JoonPyo can never find me.
Is that enough?
If only you keep that promise..
I'll keep that promise.
Fine.
I think we've come to an agreement.
I'm not losing to you. i'm not running away or stealing either.
You are...
The most evil person I've ever known.
The people that I love....
I don't want them entangled with you. so I'm leaving.
From you, ...the person I love the most
I can't save, and it makes me feel so anxious
Goo JoonPyo
Hmm?
Stop the car here.
Here?
Why?
Just stop the car. What's up with these bags?
Is this a surprise event?
Goo JoonPyo,
I'm not going to see you anymore. What
Today was my last day with you
Hey, Geum JanD Are you bothered that we didn't fight once today? Even if you're going to joke around, what kind of a joke is this?
I'm not joking. What's your reason?
Did the witch do something to you again? No, it was my decision. to take you out of my life.
Geum jandi Thank you for everything. Take care.
DON'T LEAVE You said you liked me Your love is like this
JanDi!
Geum JanDi!
JanDi! I said pull over!
JanDi!
JanDi !
Ever since I've liked you, I've always wished for it... that you were a normal guy that had nothing to do with ShinHwa or being a plutocrat. Sorry GooJunPyo For not being able to keep our promise.
JanDi! Grandfather is here. Where is she?
Jandi? This child! I'm sorry that I have to leave this way.
Then my future daughter-in-law is Jun Sul Group's daughter! My daughter goes to ShinHwa High School. I've even made dinner for ShinHwa Group's heir, Goo JoonPyo.
Oh, welcome. What can I get you Give me one of these
M, M . . . However, he lost everything because of some large corporations. He was divorced and lost his kids, too.
JanDi!
Mom! What brought you here? I wanted to see you.
JanDi, come on. Let's go talk! Why don't you all watch over my little store?
Watch it carefully! How and what brought you here, JanDi?
She looks like she's grown well. What? Dad's on a boat?
What were we supposed to do?
Our debt kept growing. We have to send your brother, KangSan, to school.
It seems like we can't even support the three of us.
Why didn't you tell me then?
What good would it have done except to make you worry? I could have quit school, gotten a job. I could have done something.
And that's why I didn't say anything
You need to graduate from ShinHwa High and go to ShinHwa University.
Get married to Master JoonPyo or someone so we can survive.
That's our hope.
Mom...
That's rubbish.
Wait, you....why aren't you going to school and why'd you suddenly come here? I came because I missed you guys. Mom, dad, San.
I came. You're healthy, right? Please look after your health!
Dad!
Dad! Have you heard any news about JanDi? Well....
I know... It's as if he's sitting on a time bomb. It's hard to watch from above or below.
He's doing well with his grandfather.
Do you think Yoon JiHoo going to work everyday at the Foundation is normal? For a guy who used to sleep all the time and mess around with his instruments to act like that is.... I think is more strange than how JoonPyo is, and it makes me quite worried.
Oh, what to do! Our JanDi has come to visit and the ban chan (side dishes) are lacking. What about the ban chan?
It'll be nice if you could stay a long time.
I like you. No matter how much I've tried not to like you, even though I've tried to erase the feeling, I can't, to the point where I'm just frustrated.
JoonPyo.
According to his Facebook page, which I only go to about 20 times a day, he works out here every day, so we might run into him.
Look, there he is.
Oh, Jesus look at that.
It's like a calendar photo.
Yeah, and I tap that!
Yeah, me.
I tapped that!
Not fair.
Oh, that Butt.
It's like a shelf.
He's going!
What do we do?
Not too obvious.
Hey, Babe!
Hey.
What are you doing here?
What a coincidence.
I didn't know that you worked out at Elysian Park, too.
I do.
Gosh, I'm surprised we haven't see you here before.
We come here everyday, don't we guys?
Then why did we have to use Google Maps to find the place...
So, what do you like to do?
Oh, all the usual stuff, dude.
You know, push-ups, free weights, crunches.
A lot of "Ab" and "Core" work.
In fact, this week is my "Core Week".
It kind of sounds like my Boot Camp Class.
Exactly.
Well, you know, my bartending gig isn't quite paying all my bills right now, so I'm sort of training to be a Personal Trainer.
If you guys would be in to it, you could be my guinea pigs today and work you out.
We'll be whatever you want us to be, Todd.
Well, I'd have to put on my mean tough drill sergeant persona.
Go for it.
ALL RlGHT YOU
BEER GUZZLlNG, PlZZA EATlNG, SACKS OF CRAP!!
NOW, GET DOWN ON AND GlVE ME 20 PUSHUPS!!
LET'S GO, I AM DEAD SERlOUS!!
NOW, NOW, NOW!!
LET'S GO!!
You are SO going to pay for this!
DlD I SAY YOU CAN SPEAK, CUPCAKE!! I DON"T THlNK SO!!
YOU JUST BOUGHT YOUR SELF ANOTHER 20!
NOW LET"S GO!!
TOUCH YOUR NOSE TO THE GROUND!!
COME ON, UP....AND DOWN...
PATHETlC!!
PATHETlC!!
Come on, ladies.
Feel the burn. It's a good thing.
Guys!!
Is he having a heart attack?
Oh, God I hope so.
Then we will finally have an excuse to stop this madness.
Guys, guys!!
I didn't say it was time for a break.
We still have 3 more miles to..
Oh shit!
Honey, are you OK?
I just wanna...
I just..
What's he trying to say?
I think what he is trying to tell you is... although, Wood and I are in excellent shape and could do 12 more miles...
Clearly.
He really really needs to stop.
He also, wants to know, if you happen to have served your roommate a Martini the night your working the party at our house.
You got all that from the wheezing, right here?
Well, no...I mean, we've known each other a long time.
So, you know, we can practically finish each other's sentences.
Look, I didn't serve JCub anything.
Like I said, I didn't even know he was at the party.
Well somebody did!
He was poisoned!
And he did eat any of the food.
He just had the one cocktail.
You think I spiked the Martini?!
No, no! Absolutely not!
Why would I do something like that?
JCub was my friend and my roommate.
And now that he is dead and gone, I'm screwed on bills this month.
That's why I need to do this training thing.
Well, somebody slipped it in his drink!
Well I was at the bar all night and I only took one break, for 15 minutes tops.
Who covered for you when you went on your break?
Birthday boy.
Me?!
I don't even remember.
I hope that's not too strong.
What, What?
That makes me the killer?
Come on.
Up..oh, God.
Now look, you're the most adorable, sweet, cuddly man I ever met.
You couldn't hurt a fly.
Kiss.
Now, come on.
We got some more work to do here.
This ain't going to fix itself.
Let's go.
What?
What? Don't give me that look!
OK, you heard him.
He did not even see JCub that night.
He could be lying.
I mean, how much do we really know about this guy?
We know a lot about him., OK?
And if there's one thing I know, it's that he's innocent!
Trust me!!
Shit, I'm probably sleeping with a murderer.
When we first met Sal Khan 18 months ago, he was working at home in a converted closet in the heart of Silicone Valley.
The former hedge fund analyst had recently quit his job to do something that at the time, sounded a bit strange.
Right now, I'm cash flow negative.
He gave up a paycheck with a hefty ambition, to help educate the world online.
A lot of people thought I was kind of crazy.
Obviously you know, when every waking hour you have, you would sneak into a room and make math videos, and put them on YouTube, people would kind of question, you know, what's up.
What originally started as some math tutoring for a cousin, turned into a global phenomenon.
The idea didn't seem so crazy anymore.
Though Khan, a brilliant MlT and Harvard grad with a wife and two children to support was slowly starting to run out of his savings.
That's when he learned that one comment from the right man can change everything.
An out of the blue endorsement from Bill Gates.
There's a new website that I've just been using with my kids recently called Khan Academy, K-H-A-N.
Just one guy doing some unbelievable 15 minute tutorials.
It was surreal, I mean it's one of those things where, you know, it's this person that you grew up knowing, kind of almost a hero most of your life, all of your life.
Soon Gates kicked in a million and a half dollars.
He also won two million from Google.
It had a contest to see who had the best ideas to better the planet.
We did now have millions of dollars to essentially pursue the dream.
A dream that's enabled him to post more than 2300 videos on a host of different subjects, from math, to history, to economics.
It involves an expansion of the central bank's balance sheet.
Khan has expanded his approach to create a software platform for classrooms, and he's working closely with one local school district.
Why don't you start with reviewing some of these and getting them out of the way?
It was really just starting with me just saying look, my cousins have a problem,
I think I have a solution for my cousin's problem, so I did it.
It required pretty much no resources, a little bit of my time.
It was like, oh wait, my cousins liked it? And other people liked it?
Let's keep going!
With his newfound fame and resources, this is the worldwide headquarters of the Khan Academy,
Khan has been able to ditch the bedroom closet for an office.
And he now has a small staff to take things to an even higher level.
A true gentleman would never leave such a beautiful lady by herself..
This is a dream, right?
I feel like I'm floating.
It would be nice if she got off of my shoes...
She looks like a completely different person.
Definitely Min Seo Hyun's work.
Maybe I should bring her to my next exhibition as my partner.
What the...
WAHHH!!!
Save me!!!
He fell! Senior Goo Joon Pyo fell into the pool!
Come quickly!
What is it?
Why is it such a big deal ?
He can't
Eh?
The only thing the GREAT Goo Joon Pyo cannot do is swim!
Goo Joon Pyo!
Goo Joon Pyo!
Wake up!
Open your eyes!
Ya!
What the..
You're such scum.
You swindling bastard!
Achoo!!
Master, I'm sorry!
I'll prepare the tea again! Please forgive me!
For what?
Have you caught a cold?
Shall I call Doctor Kim?
What cold?
I feel great.
Prepare the car, I should go to school soon.
You want to leave this early sir?
It's never too early for a student going to school.
Don't you know that bugs that wake up early die early?
I'll fire the maid immediately.
But why?
Pardon?
Butler Lee, don't you think you are too uptight?
Relax. Relax.
Ahhh, what wonderful weather!
What the..
Goo Joon Pyo!
Wait until I get my hands on you!
If you get caught, you're done for.
Getting here so early just to work on that.
This is the first time I've seen him try this hard.
Problem is, why must he torture the poor transfer student
Furthermore, if you think about it, isn't she the one who saved his life?
Don't bite the hand that feeds you. This is a situation you use it in, isn't that right?
What are you guys talking about?
This is my way of saying thanks for yesterday.
If not, why would I bother to do such silly things to a low class person.
Normal people may not be grateful for this.
Ji Hoo isn't here.
So now you are picking on me instead, huh?
Right, why isn't that guy here, anyway?
After he came back from Hainan Island, he slipped into depression
Lovers quarrel huh? idiot!
If you like a girl, just grab her.
What's so hard about that?
I'll just leave after I do this...
First, it was Senior Joon Pyo and now, Senior Ji Hoo?
Does she have a death wish or something?
Oh, my god!
Look at that fox!
Naturally, that girl is the type that doesn't know when to back off.
What the heck are we supposed to do now?
(Geum Jan Di's ‚ô•)
Hey!
Don't you think you're arriving kind of late? Could you even be on a swim team? You'd be forced off for sure.
Could you even be on a swim team?
You'd be kicked out for sure..
I think they've been meeting up for a while.
There's a reason senior JiHoo is so protective of JanDi .
As time passes, friendships are even being affected because of this girl.
So now you know that even though JanDi looks innocent, her actions are those of a lovely snake.
Shut up!!
If you say one more word, I will twist your neck.
That was brand new...
Disappointed the one you were really hoping to see isn't here?
Goo JoonPyo!
Why are you . . .
What?
Am I not allowed to come here?
Did you two rent this place out or something?
Where are you going?
Since I have nothing to say to you I'm going home. Do you have a problem with that?
I do
What the heck are you doing?!
I have something to say!
Let go.. and talk.
Who do you think you are to fool with me?
To mess with us, the great F4 ?
Who fooled whom?
Let go!!
Was I a joke?
Just 'cause i went easy on someone like you?
I don't know if you know this about me, but I'm not a charitable person.
It's dissatisfying having to give more than I can take.
What the heck are you doing?
No!
Stop!
No!
Do you hate me that much?
Geum Jan Di, are you going to school or not?
I'm not going!
Would you like to get hit and go? Or just go?
Just hit me and I won't go.
Hit me!
Huh!
You, really!
Would you like to get hit and go? Or just go? I want to get hit and not go.
Hit me! I'm not going! I can't go!
I'd rather break the ice of the Han river and swim there.
I'm not going back that school! Never!
Do you want me to die?
Isn't today PlaySat.(nol toh= short for "playing saturday")?
And also, some man delivered this for you.
What is that?
What's that?
Invitation. Hello.
I want to invite all of you to my home to celebrate my 23rd birthday.
Please free up your schedule so you can attend.. Min SeoHyun
Pa...
Party!!
Party?
Then, is our Jan Di finally making her debut in society?
Oh, honey! &lt;BR&gt;Honey, honey, honey...
Give me the card.
Give it to me!
It's not time for us to be doing this right now.
Dress, honey dress, dress
Dress!
Take this one here.
I'm sorry, Jan Di. I can't even give my daughter a nice evening dress.
I'm sorry, JanDi. Since our neighborhood is poor, they don't bring in decent clothes to be serviced here either!
Ah!
There's a hanbok.
How this? Will it do?
Is she going to a traditional wedding?
They said garden party, PARTY!
Isn't this the part where the charming prince comes and takes the girl shopping for a dress?
Hello.
This is a gift from Ms. Min Seo Hyun.
Min Seo Hyun?!
Let's see, let's see.
Does it fit?
A little bit lower.
Why didn't you call last time?
You said you were going to call me, but you never did.
Wait a minute, you said the same thing to me too!
Who did you come with tonight?
I don't think you're with someone. What do you think about me??
What are you talking about?
It's me that he wants!
Ya!
Don't touch him.
You're funny!
Hold on, hold on, sorry!
Hey, darling, why are you so late?
What brings you here?
Seo Hyun unnie invited me here, why?
Did you empty the departmental store ?
I thought this last time too, but doesn't Geum Jan Di look pretty good when she's all dressed up?
Right.
You're the cutest one here.
Cute??!
Can you transform a pumpkin into a watermelon just by drawing some lines on it?
- Huh!
Goo Joon Pyo - has a point.
Happy Birthday to you.
Dear Min Seo Hyun~ Happy Birthday to you~
Thank you all for coming here to celebrate my 23rd birthday
I would like to thank my family and friends for their love and care.
I also have something else to announce to all of you.
That was why I held this huge party, which is not like me.
Where'd that punk Ji Hoo go?
They're not gonna announce their engagement, are they?
I'm going back to Paris next week
And I won't be returning to Korea.
I've already packed and arranged everything and folded model activities.
What's she talking about?
I do not wish to rely on the fruits of my parents' labor.
Instead, I would like to start fresh relying only on my own abilities.
I will not be taking over my parent's law firm.
Because I want a life where I can travel the world and give back as much as I can.
My decision is bound to cause an uproar since it will be hard for those of you with differing views to understand.
Everyone... please be happy for me.
Min SeoHyun, she's always full of surprises!
JiHoo... did he know about this the whole time?
Now we know the reason why he's been so depressed.
It's impressive, but, what's JiHoo gonna do?
Hi.
I can't believe you still have this.
It's from the first time we were separated.
You remember, huh?
It's since then that you stopped calling me noona.
What was I to you?
Our Ji Hoo must be very mad.
I also feel like I'm being thrown away.
If there is something here that can't be so easily thrown away... it's... you.
Don't lie!
If it was a lie, then it wouldn't have bothered me that you're interested in someone else.
What are you talking about?
When you dashed towards that girl, I don't know why but my heart sank.
Funny, right?
I'm not in the mood for jokes.
But isn't it great?
Our JiHoo has really become a man.
Don't joke around!
You'll do what you want anyway.
But you'll tighten me today and loosen me up tomorrow so I can neither go to you nor distance myself from you.
I was just a toy.
If I lost you I would not be able to sleep
Who's interested in whom?
Only looking at Min Seo Hyun for 15 years, it's not enough!
I'm a man, too!
A man who's eager to embrace a woman called Min Seo Hyun!
I know, me too.
Sorry, Ji Hoo. I'm really sorry.
It would be really embarrassing if you passed out there.
Such behavior really doesn't suit you.
You know that, right?
Who says I was going to faint?
Oh, JanDi, you came... but why didn't you come in?
Ah... that... uh... that's because...
I was about to come to greet you and say thank you.
I came by... just NOW.
The party was chaotic, yes?
We were thinking of going on a quiet drive together. Would you like to come with us then?
Eh? Oh, no.. it's ok.
We have somewhere else to go.
We?
Yes both of us were also going to go for a drive.
Drive! We're going to...
Then, goodbye.
See you later.
Let's go.
- Unni-
I've paid my debt.
What debt?
Saving me at the pool.
You want to repay me for saving your life just like that?
Then shall we go back?
10%
let's say it's even.. 50 25
This is nice.
But why aren't there any customers?
I sent them out.
Why?
I rented it out til the morning, so do whatever you want.
Do whatever I want, what?
Yell or cry.
If you want to hit someone, do you want me to call a Mr. portly on standby outside?
Why do I have to do that?
Dldn't you have a heart attack after seeing JiHoo and SeoHyun?
What? no way!
Someone like me can't compete with Min SeoHyun, right.?
I'm not pretty, not smart either. And I come from a poor family.
And your figure is mediocre and your character sucks too.
THAT'S RlGHT!
How could a girl like me dare to be jealous of Min SeoHyun?
I didn't have a chance against her from the beginning.
Even though there's lots of bad things about you, there are still some good things.
You have potential.
Huh?
I'm certain if Ji Hoo had met you first, he would have fallen for you.
Seriously?
Looks, brains, and background may not be much, but you're the first girl I've approved of.
Full of potential.
Hang on, I need to go use the restroom.
It's warm.
Isn't it warm?
It's warm, I'm thirsty. Water.
Man, what the heck?
Hey, Dry Cleaner!
Hey, wake up!
What's wrong with her?
Well, it's because of that.
She drank all of it?
Yes.
Hey. Hey!
Wake up, woman!
Woman?
Yeah, I'm a woman.
I know that my family background, my physical appearance and my brains are all crap. Even without you pointing that out, I feel it in my bones every day, you bastard!
What?
Bastard?
No, no.
I don't have time to waste on things like this.
If you only knew how busy I am.
I have to be a loser at an exclusive school where it's not fate, do part-time jobs because of a Dad who causes so much trouble.
And for tuition, I have to swim so I can get a scholarship.
I don't have time to butt into you princes' love lives!
You alcoholic Hey, gangster!
Wake up!
Ya!
I'm so sad lately.
I'm a bit sad.
You bastard!
Goo JoonPyo!
You're the enemy!
Fine, I'll let this go because I feel like it.
50%!
I'm saying that I'll cut in half what you owe to your savior!!
Thank you Goo JoonPyo, for saving me today.
I don't really have anything I can do for you, instead, I will . . . .
Aisshh!
"Charity Auction in aid of Namibian Refugees"
I just know this is a really expensive room just by smelling it.
You have a really good sense of smell. (geh koh: euphemism short for "you have a nose like a dog")
What happened?
Why am I here?
You're here because I brought you here.
That's what I'm saying!
Why am I here and not my house!
You don't remember?
This suit just came from Milan two days ago, and was designed by the famous designer, Yoshikuchi Kenzi, of Ermenegildo Zegna as one of his new works for this spring/summer collection.
The price is . . .
Hey, stop.
There's no reason to shock her.
I'm not exactly in the mood to listen to you brag about your clothes right now in this kind of situation!
That's what I wore yesterday.
What's that got to do with me?!
It was the first time I wore that suit, and my last, thanks to someone.
Do you remember now?
Then, in that state, we needed to come to my house.
Or should we have gone to yours?
Sorry.
I already notified your parents.
According to the driver, they didn't seem that concerned.
I'll leave now.
I'm sorry for all the trouble I may have caused you.
Just do what you normally do.
Young master.
What's the matter?
The lady of the house . . .
What about the witch?
She has arrived.
Already?
Why is she here already?
What about JoonPyo?
He is on the second floor.
I'm going to have him take part in the event, so put someone on him to make sure he doesn't run off somewhere.
Yes, ma'am.
What?
It's an emergency!
YJH:
What?
GJP:
The witch showed up here.
JanDi is in my room right now, but I can't get her out!
Joonpyo, if you get caught, then . .
You're dead meat!
She finds an unfamiliar girl in her son's room, especially someone with Geum JanDi's profile.
I'm really curious.
I'll bet $1,000 that she'll send JoonPyo to Alaska tomorrow morning.
I'll bet $3,000 that she'll send him to Sejong Antarctic Research Center.&lt;BR&gt;
Rather than that, she'll probably hire an asassin first.
What?
Really? Is she really that scary?
Do you remember the day we ran away from 6th grade camp?
We almost died.
How can I forget?
Don't move!
Bonjour!
Noona!
Is this really So YiJong?
Can you really look this cool?
Noona is the very one whom people call a Korean Vivienne Westwood.
What is it?
Hurry up and tell me,
Hm?
What is it you want?
After all, this is why I like noona so much.
A request to sponsor needy schoolchildren has come in from Seoul City..
Reject.
The Ministry of Education would like to conduct a special selection process for agriculture students at Shinhwa University from next year onwards....
Reject.
You've held up JoonPyo well, right?
Yes.
Hello.
Who is she?
Ah!
Hello.
She's my guest, so don't worry about it.
She's in my house, so she's my guest as well.
Isn't that right, young lady?
She's a friend.
Friend?
Yes, she's our junior at our school.
She's a cute sophomore, so we're specifically training her as the F4 mascot. Something like that..
Whose daughter are you?
I'm the . .
What does your father do?
My father - has a business.
Really?
What kind?
He's in the clothing business.
No, I mean, fashion business.
It's actually pretty famous within the industry.
That's interesting.
So, do you have any interest in today's auction?
Yes, she has more than an interest.
With the new dress from Bella, she's the darkhorse who will definitely raise a lot of donations tonight..
I guess your mother has a very discerning eye.
What does your mother do?
President, it's time for you to greet your guests.
Joon Pyo, come downstairs and take your place.
The rest of you, since it's for a good cause, do your part before you leave.
Yes ma'm!
Why did you lie?
How are you going to fix this?
We should have told the truth.
Then, should we tell the truth that your dad owns a dry cleaner and your mom, a sauna?
If we did that, then no one knows what would've happened to not only you, but to your family as well.
It's not a joke when we say that you won't survive once you've been singled out.
So it's genetic, huh?
Yes, this next auction item, once you see it, I bet your eyes will jump!
It's coming out now, please look closely.
It's Swimmer Pak Taehwan's goggles!

Great!
[auctioneer]
What are you doing?Hurry up, it;s your turn now!
[auctioneer speaking]
Yes the next auction item, it's very dazzling
I can't do that!
Please!
Please!
You can do it!
I can't!
I can't!
Yes, the light yellow tint, and the lemon-like color will uplift the wearer's glamour..
The gold spangles and beads stress the luxury of the item.
We are starting the bid for this Bella Song dress at $10,000.
Yes, we have $10,000!
Do we have higher bids? $15,000?
How is JoonPyo doing these days?
He has been very quiet.
He is even attending school well.
Do you know that student? &lt;i&gt; [Banditore]
It's a pleasure to finally meet the famous wonder girl.
I didn't push him.
Really, I -
Mr. Jung.
Yes?
I know that she is a student of Shin-Hwa High School.
Find out whose daughter she is.
Yes, madam.
[auctioneer speaking] [auctioneer speaking]
Is this real?
Are these really the goggles that Pak TaeHwan used?
Mmm.
WAHHH!
Noona, noona, big news!
Now what?
Pak Tae Hwan's goggles!
If you sell them, you can get at least $2,000! $2,000?! $2,000 for goggles?
Sell them!
We have to sell them.
Where can you find $2,000?
No way!!
It's worth so much more.
What I'm saying is, this is one of those things that you can't put a price on.
Sell it. $2,000 is $2,000.
I would understand if it were just $20.
What's wrong with you?
But still, if we sell them . . . It's kind of . .
Ah . . . I don't know.
Good night.
Hey!
Why, you little!
HEY!
I'm going now.
Anyway, thanks.
What?I can't hear you !
I said thank you. What?
What?
I said, THANK YOU!!
Just a plain "thank you" would've sufficed.
For being a commoner, all you have is your big pride.
That's it. I take it back! What?
I'm taking back the thank you!
What was I thinking?
People don't change that easily.
I'm leaving.
Hey, Jandi Baht (field of grass)
You don't drink when I'm not around.
SeoHyun Unni?
What brings you here?
I had to take care of something regarding my dropping out of school.
I wanted to see you one more time before I left. What a relief.
Dropping out of school? You're really not going to come back?
Most likely.
Tomorrow.
Ah. So soon?
I still haven't been able to say thank you . . .
I haven't even returned the favor.
If you keep saying things like that then I'm going to be sad.
I knew from the moment I saw you, that it was you whom JiHoo talked about with a smile on his face.
Um.. Unni.
JanDi, What are you doing?
I was a fan of yours way before I even met you.
So, that's why I know better than anyone why you made this kind of decision. But...
I'm begging you, please don't leave.
Please stand up.
I know that I have no right to make this kind of request and that you have no reason to listen to me, but if I don't even try . . .
Is it because of JiHoo?
I don't know anything about Senior JiHoo
But, I do know how much he cares about you.
And for some reason, I can see the sad look in his eyes.
But, there are times when he does smile.
He smiles so warmly that whoever is watching him feels that warmth.
The only person who can make him smile is you.
If you leave like this, he may never smile again.
Please stand up.
To me, when a person tries to decide what to do, it's similar to buying something in a foreign country.
If you don't buy it at that very moment, then there's no second chance.
I know very well how agonizing that regret is.
JiHoo is an important person to me.
And I also believe that I am to him as well.
That's why I don't believe that he would want me to regret my decision.
What do you think?
I'm sorry.
I'm very sorry.
No, I'm really happy you said those things.
Thank you.
Unni . . .
Oh, hang on.
Are these . . . for me? As I told you, shoes are of the utmost importance.
I'll pray that these shoes take you to great places without fail.
I also have a request for you.
Please, make JiHoo . . . smile again.
Who do you think you are?
Who are you to say those things thing!?
Who asked you to make that kind of request?
No, not a request, to beg?
Don't you have any pride?
It's not because I don't have any pride.
It's because you're in such agony.
Because you looked like you would die of sadness.
What's it to you?!
It has nothing to do with you!
Get lost
Lauren Hodge:
If you were going to a restaurant and wanted a healthier option, which would you choose, grilled or fried chicken?
Now most people would answer grilled, and it's true that grilled chicken does contain less fat and fewer calories.
However, grilled chicken poses a hidden danger.
The hidden danger is heterocyclic amines -- specifically phenomethylimidazopyridine, or PhlP -- (laughter) which is the immunogenic or carcinogenic compound.
A carcinogen is any substance or agent that causes abnormal growth of cells, which can also cause them to metastasize or spread.
They are also organic compounds in which one or more of the hydrogens in ammonia is replaced with a more complex group.
Studies show that antioxidants are known to decrease these heterocyclic amines.
However, no studies exist yet that show how or why.
These here are five different organizations that classify carcinogens.
And as you can see, none of the organizations consider the compounds to be safe, which justifies the need to decrease them in our diet.
Now you might wonder how a 13 year-old girl could come up with this idea.
And I was led to it through a series of events.
I first learned about it through a lawsuit I read about in my doctor's office -- (Laughter) which was between the Physician's Committee for Responsible Medicine and seven different fast food restaurants.
They weren't sued because there was carcinogens in the chicken, but they were sued because of California's Proposition 65, which stated that if there's anything dangerous in the products then the companies had to give a clear warning.
So I was very surprised about this.
And I was wondering why nobody knew more about this dangerous grilled chicken, which doesn't seem very harmful.
But then one night, my mom was cooking grilled chicken for dinner, and I noticed that the edges of the chicken, which had been marinated in lemon juice, turned white.
And later in biology class, I learned that it's due to a process called denaturing, which is where the proteins will change shape and lose their ability to chemically function.
So I combined these two ideas and I formulated a hypothesis, saying that, could possibly the carcinogens be decreased due to a marinade and could it be due to the differences in PH?
So my idea was born, and I had the project set up and a hypothesis, so what was my next step?
Well obviously I had to find a lab to work at because I didn't have the equipment in my school.
I thought this would be easy, but I emailed about 200 different people within a five-hour radius of where I lived, and I got one positive response that said that they could work with me.
Most of the others either never responded back, said they didn't have the time or didn't have the equipment and couldn't help me.
So it was a big commitment to drive to the lab to work multiple times.
However, it was a great opportunity to work in a real lab -- so I could finally start my project.
The first stage was completed at home, which consisted of marinating the chicken, grilling the chicken, amassing it and preparing it to be transported to the lab.
The second stage was completed at the Penn State University main campus lab, which is where I extracted the chemicals, changed the PH so I could run it through the equipment and separated the compounds I needed from the rest of the chicken.
The final stages, when I ran the samples through a high-pressure liquid chromatography mass spectrometer, which separated the compounds and analyzed the chemicals and told me exactly how much carcinogens I had in my chicken.
So when I went through the data, I had very surprising results, because I found that four out of the five marinating ingredients actually inhibited the carcinogen formation.
When compared with the unmarinated chicken, which is what I used as my control, I found that lemon juice worked by far the best, which decreased the carcinogens by about 98 percent.
The saltwater marinade and the brown sugar marinade also worked very well, decreasing the carcinogens by about 60 percent.
Olive oil slightly decreased the PhlP formation, but it was nearly negligible.
And the soy sauce results were inconclusive because of the large data range, but it seems like soy sauce actually increased the potential carcinogens.
Another important factor that I didn't take into account initially was the time cooked.
And I found that if you increase the time cooked, the amount of carcinogens rapidly increases.
So the best way to marinate chicken, based on this, is to, not under-cook, but definitely don't over-cook and char the chicken, and marinate in either lemon juice, brown sugar or saltwater.
(Applause)
Based on these findings, I have a question for you.
Would you be willing to make a simple change in your diet that could potentially save your life?
Now I'm not saying that if you eat grilled chicken that's not marinated, you're definitely going to catch cancer and die.
However, anything you can do to decrease the risk of potential carcinogens can definitely increase the quality of lifestyle.
Is it worth it to you?
How will you cook your chicken now?
(Applause)
Shree Bose:
Hi everyone.
I'm Shree Bose.
I was the 17-18 year-old age category winner and then the grand prize winner.
And I want all of you to imagine a little girl holding a dead blue spinach plant.
And she's standing in front of you and she's explaining to you that little kids will eat their vegetables if they're different colors.
Sounds ridiculous, right.
But that was me years ago.
And that was my first science fair project.
It got a bit more complicated from there.
My older brother Panaki Bose spent hours of his time explaining atoms to me when I barely understood basic algebra.
My parents suffered through many more of my science fair projects, including a remote controlled garbage can.
(Laughter)
And then came the summer after my freshman year, when my grandfather passed away due to cancer.
And I remember watching my family go through that and thinking that I never wanted another family to feel that kind of loss.
So, armed with all the wisdom of freshman year biology, I decided I wanted to do cancer research at 15.
Good plan.
So I started emailing all of these professors in my area asking to work under their supervision in a lab.
Got rejected by all except one.
And then went on, my next summer, to work under Dr. Basu at the UNT Health Center at Fort Worth, Texas.
And that is where the research began.
So ovarian cancer is one of those cancers that most people don't know about, or at least don't pay that much attention to.
But yet, it's the fifth leading cause of cancer deaths among women in the United States.
In fact, one in 70 women will be diagnosed with ovarian cancer.
One in 100 will die from it.
Chemotherapy, one of the most effective ways used to treat cancer today, involves giving patients really high doses of chemicals to try and kill off cancer cells.
Cisplatin is a relatively common ovarian cancer chemotherapy drug -- a relatively simple molecule made in the lab that messes with the DNA of cancer cells and causes them to kill themselves.
Sounds great, right?
But here's the problem: sometimes patients become resistant to the drug, and then years after they've been declared to be cancer free, they come back.
And this time, they no longer respond to the drug.
It's a huge problem.
In fact, it's one of the biggest problems with chemotherapy today.
So we wanted to figure out how these ovarian cancer cells are becoming resistant to this drug called Cisplatin.
And we wanted to figure this out, because if we could figure that out, then we might be able to prevent that resistance from ever happening.
So that's what we set out to do.
And we thought it had something to do with this protein called AMP kinase, an energy protein.
So we ran all of these tests blocking the protein, and we saw this huge shift.
I mean, on the slide, you can see that on our sensitive side, these cells that are responding to the drug, when we start blocking the protein, the number of dying cells -- those colored dots -- they're going down.
But then on this side, with the same treatment, they're going up -- interesting.
But those are dots on a screen for you; what exactly does that mean?
Well basically that means that this protein is changing from the sensitive cell to the resistant cell.
And in fact, it might be changing the cells themselves to make the cells resistant.
And that's huge.
In fact, it means that if a patient comes in and they're resistant to this drug, then if we give them a chemical to block this protein, then we can treat them again with the same drug.
And that's huge for chemotherapy effectiveness -- possibly for many different types of cancer.
So that was my work, and it was my way of reimagining the future for future research, with figuring out exactly what this protein does, but also for the future of chemotherapy effectiveness -- so maybe all grandfathers with cancer have a little bit more time to spend with their grandchildren.
But my work wasn't just about the research.
It was about finding my passion.
That's why being the grand prize winner of the Google Global Science Fair -- cute picture, right -- it was so exciting to me and it was such an amazing honor.
And ever since then,
I've gotten to do some pretty cool stuff -- from getting to meet the president to getting to be on this stage to talk to all of you guys.
But like I said, my journey wasn't just about the research, it was about finding my passion, and it was about making my own opportunities when I didn't even know what I was doing.
It was about inspiration and determination and never giving up on my interest for science and learning and growing.
After all, my story begins with a dried, withered spinach plant and it's only getting better from there.
Thank you.
(Applause)
Naomi Shah:
Hi everyone.
I'm Naomi Shah, and today I'll be talking to you about my research involving indoor air quality and asthmatic patients.
1.6 million deaths worldwide.
One death every 20 seconds.
People spend over 90 percent of their lives indoors.
And the economic burden of asthma exceeds that of HlV and tuberculosis combined.
Now these statistics had a huge impact on me, but what really sparked my interest in my research was watching both my dad and my brother suffer from chronic allergies year-round.
It confused me; why did these allergy symptoms persist well past the pollen season?
With this question in mind, I started researching, and I soon found that indoor air pollutants were the culprit.
As soon as I realized this, I investigated the underlying relationship between four prevalent air pollutants and their affect on the lung health of asthmatic patients.
At first, I just wanted to figure out which of these four pollutants have the largest negative health impact on the lung health of asthmatic patients.
But soon after, I developed a novel mathematical model that essentially quantifies the effect of these environmental pollutants on the lung health of asthmatic patients.
And it surprises me that no model currently exists that quantifies the effect of environmental factors on human lung health, because that relationship seems so important.
So with that in mind, I started researching more, I started investigating more, and I became very passionate.
Because I realized that if we could find a way to target remediation, we could also find a way to treat asthmatic patients more effectively.
For example, volatile organic compounds are chemical pollutants that are found in our schools, homes and workplaces.
They're everywhere.
These chemical pollutants are currently not a criteria air pollutant, as defined by the U.S. Clean Air Act.
Which is surprising to me, because these chemical pollutants, through my research, I show that they had a very large negative impact on the lung health of asthmatic patients and thus should be regulated.
So today I want to show you my interactive software model that I created.
I'm going to show it to you on my laptop.
And I have a volunteer subject in the audience today, Julie.
And all of Julie's data has been pre-entered into my interactive software model.
And this can be used by anyone.
So I want you to imagine that you're in Julie's shoes, or someone who's really close to you who suffers from asthma or another lung disorder.
So Julie's going to her doctor's office to get treated for her asthma.
And the doctor has her sit down, and he takes her peak expiratory flow rate -- which is essentially her exhalation rate, or the amount of air that she can breathe out in one breath.
So that peak expiratory flow rate, I've entered it up into the interactive software model.
I've also entered in her age, her gender and her height.
I've assumed that she lives in an average household with average air pollutant levels.
So any user can come in here and click on "lung function report" and it'll take them to this report that I created.
And this report really drives home the crux of my research.
So what it shows -- if you want to focus on that top graph in the right-hand corner -- it shows Julie's actual peak expiratory flow rate in the yellow bar.
This is the measurement that she took in her doctor's office.
In the blue bar at the bottom of the graph, it shows what her peak expiratory flow rate, what her exhalation rate or lung health, should be based on her age, gender and height.
So the doctor sees this difference between the yellow bar and the blue bar, and he says, "Wow, we need to give her steroids, medication and inhalers."
But I want everyone here to reimagine a world where instead of prescribing steroids, inhalers and medication, the doctor turns to Julie and says,
"Why don't you go home and clean out your air filters.
Clean out the air ducts in your home, in your workplace, in your school.
Stop the use of incense and candles.
And if you're remodeling your house, take out all the carpeting and put in hardwood flooring."
Because these solutions are natural, these solutions are sustainable, and these solutions are long-term investments -- long-term investments that we're making for our generation and for future generations.
Because these environmental solutions that Julie can make in her home, her workplace and her school are impacting everyone that lives around her.
So I'm very passionate about this research and I really want to continue it and expand it to more disorders besides asthma, more respiratory disorders, as well as more pollutants.
But before I end my talk today, I want to leave you with one saying.
And that saying is that genetics loads the gun, but the environment pulls the trigger.
And that made a huge impact on me when I was doing this research.
Because what I feel, is a lot of us think that the environment is at a macro level, that we can't do anything to change our air quality or to change the climate or anything.
But if each one of us takes initiative in our own home, in our own school and in our own workplace, we can make a huge difference in air quality.
Because remember, we spend 90 percent of our lives indoors.
And air quality and air pollutants have a huge impact on the lung health of asthmatic patients, anyone with a respiratory disorder and really all of us in general.
So I want you to reimagine a world with better air quality, better quality of life and better quality of living for everyone including our future generations.
Thank you.
(Applause)
Lisa Ling:
Right.
Can I have Shree and Lauren come up really quickly?
Your Google Science Fair champions.
Your winners.
(Applause)
When I was preparing for this talk, I was thinking and hoping that eventually, this talk will reach my students.
That's why I asked permission if I could use Filipino and I was allowed by TEDx.
And when the time comes that it reaches my students, what do I want them to hear?
That's why I created a letter for them that I'd want to share with you.
To my students, it's happy to learn, it's happy to study.
And even if you tell me that you don't want to anymore, that you are having a hard time, that you can't bear it anymore, there's still that glimmer on your eyes when we studied about the beauty of the solar system; when you asked me how typhoons are formed; when you learned about how plants eat.
And I don't believe that you can't, that you don't want to because of the glimmer on your eyes, I see that you are happy to learn.
And perhaps you can also see the same glimmer on my eyes because during that time, I learned something new about you.
Don't get the words of the people who say you can't, that you're a pest, that you have no use.
Those are not your words so don't repeat them to yourself over and over.
You're still young and you will still learn more things about yourself.
Just wait. Wait and you will be amazed at your own talent.
Don't let yourself be imprisoned by your own talents.
Come, look at my eyes.
I believe in you. You're good.
You can.
You can.
You can become anything -- doctor, engineer, lawyer, astronaut, hero.
I will help you as long as you help yourself.
Get hold of your dreams.
Don't give in.
Don't let go.
Don't be lazy.
Fulfilling dreams don't start when you're already old.
It starts now.
It starts now.
I don't know anyone yet who just suddenly woke up one day then he's already a doctor.
Toil over it.
Let's toil over it.
Even if there's no definite future, do your best right now and we'll reach where we want to go.
You might be mad at your family or your might be mad at the world.
But hopefully, hopefully in one year in my classroom, you'll experience that there's a safe place for you to go, that there's someone who cares for you, that it's possible to accept you and love you.
Don't grow up angry.
Because believe me, even if life's hard and heavy, it's still rich with love and it lightens it with hope.
Thank you.
Thank you for the one year that you came into my life because -- because even if I'm your teacher, I learned a lot from you.
And because of you, I did not only become a better teacher, I also became a better person.
You are the reason why I'm here.
You are the one who gives me reason in my teaching.
Thank you very much.
I really work our uniform.
This is the national uniform at the DepEd and we wear this on Mondays. I wore this because I want the look of a public school teacher to be recognized.
So next time that you see anyone who's in this attire, greet her because there's a high chance that she's a public school teacher or someone who works at DepEd.
During my first year as a public school teacher, I always get the following reactions -- surprise, amazement, disappointment.
Like, "Huh?
Why are you teaching there?
Oh, you're from a very good university but you're a public school teacher?
Such a waste!" Always like that.
And I even received a random Facebook message from someone I don't know who told me to not teach in a public school since I'll be a waste there.
My dad is an economist -- he's here now -- he asked me about return of investment.
What is the "return" if -- what is the return if I become a public school teacher after he worked hard for the high tuition fee of Ateneo.
The interview that I had at the Division Office of DepEd, I was asked by the interviewer, looking at my paper.
He said, "Oh, your credentials are so nice.
Why don't you teach in a private school?
Or, pursue being a doctor."
I was like, "Ma'am, looks like I'm not accepted," isn't it?
That.
And even my co-teachers at first, they were telling me that my time might be wasted at Culiat Elementary School - that I will see that it's hard to teach in public school and I will transfer to private.
It seems everyone, is saying that my decision is wrong.
Maybe I'm hardknocked that's why I still continued or maybe I just see something different with public school.
Because whenever I hear someone remark that my time here is wasted, I think that, "Wait, it's not only him that influenced by decision to become a public school teacher."
If you think about it, those remarks, pertains more towards the public schools themselves -- because if our public schools were good, proper, beautiful, they wouldn't say that to me.
Alright.
Let's play "top of mind." Favor please.
I will give a word.
In five seconds, think -- notice what enters your mind when I give the word.
The rule here is that don't do too much thinking, okay?
Okay.
There.
What enters your mind when the word "public school" is mentioned?
Eh, what about "public school teacher?" You don't have to shout it out.
[Laughs]
Public school students?
I get hurt.
Okay.
There.
Thank you very much.
I don't know what things entered your mind but it's nice to think, why those?
Why did you think of those?
My top of mind when one says "public school" is "hope.
Public school teachers, colleague.
Public school students, good.
When it was my first -- before I taught, I was -- I spent a year being a Jesuit volunteer and I was sent to Iloilo where I gave education situationers to the youth.
That's why I know what I entered.
I know about the lack of chairs, textbooks and classrooms, about the large number of students but with only a small percentage finishing, about the hardwork and diligence of the parents and students in view of reaching their dreams.
I know all of those.
The one who destroyed my life was also a teacher, my mentor at the Ateneo.
And -- she was the one first one who asked if I wanted to be a teacher and she described the kind of teacher that the Philippines needs.
I asked her, "Ma'am, why me?
You very well know that I will become a doctor.
My med school application is ready.
I just need to submit it.
Why me?"
Then she just looked straight to my eyes and said, "Because I believe that you can become a great teacher.
Because I believe that you can become a great teacher."
And because she believed me first, I'm here today -- experiencing those that I just storytell about during the education situationers.
In my experience, a lot of what you know about public school teachers are true -- that there are those who sell ice candy, because tocino isn't popular anymore.
There are those who hurt people, and those who don't teach properly.
But I want to say that those are not the only ones you'd see.
A lot of what you know about public school students are true -- that there are those who aren't good at reading even if they're already in Grade 5, that there are those who go to school hungry, tired because of work in the morning, those who walk some kilometers just to go to school.
But I want to say that those are not their only stories.
There's someone from the media who asked me before, "Is there hope that teachers in the public school will have a better orientation about their jobs and will teach their children to their utmost?"
It's like she asked, "Is there still hope for (public school teachers) to teach properly?" It seems that I fumed.
I seems like I wanted to introduce her to all my co-teachers, to all my friends who are public school teachers so that she can see that, wait a minute, there are more -- and really -- there are more good public teachers who love their students and care that they learn than those teachers who don't care about their being a teacher.
More often, those passionate teachers work silently.
And often, what comes out in the media are stories about bad things teachers do.
And this does not help how you see us.
But I hope, I hope, you get the pleasure to meet Sir Edmund.
He's here right now.
He has 80 students in Payatas-B Elementary School.
And when it rains, he continues to teach even if his socks and shoes are drenched because of the mini-waterfalls that are in his crowded classroom.
And you know, even though he's doing a lot of things, he's still going to teach the school youths because of the Alternative Learning System.
Ma'am Linda of Culion, Palawan, a senior teacher, who has a lot of white strands in her hair.
That's the only picture that she was in - there she is.
She has a lot of white strands in her hair but she's still learning how to search using Google because she wants to research online along with her students.
Ma'am Rodriguez always jokingly tells me, "O, you're not going to give up with the students yet?
Because I give up already." But everyday, I see her teach non-readers until they the learn how to read.
A lot of my co-teachers are here today that should be acknowledged because of their passion and dedication.
If I narrate you to their stories, we are going to run out of time.
What me and my friends do, we gathered these quiet and passionate teachers and we formed a support group because we thought, we need each other's support, because if we want to continue to change the classrooms for our students, then we really need each other's help.
And we called our group, "Kape't Guro". coffee-teacher sessions, but kapit-guro also because to show that we need to support each other.
Darwin is here today, he's there somewhere in front, and he's part of my first batch of students.
Darwin is exceptionally intelligent and excels in Science.
He's better than me but I just don't want to admit it.
But now, he knows.
And Darwin, I always bring him along in my talks in Ateneo because he's more knowledgeable about the public school than I was back then.
I was a new public school teacher, and he was already Grade Five.
So, he's been in a public school for five years.
And when I first brought him to this university, he saw the extent of the field, the Bellarmine Field, Eh, they didn't have a field at Culiat.
So Darwin ran in circles around the field several times.
He went to me panting and perspiring.
Then he told me, "Ma'am, I'm going to study here." Do you know where he is right now?
He's in second year high school at Ateneo High School, and he's an honor student.
[applause]
The very first student that came from Culiat Elementary School that passed Ateneo High School.
I told my father, "Dad, that's my return of investment."
(Thank you).
Dad.
It's rare to have a Darwin in the life of a teacher.
But our dream and I know this is what Darwin dreams of too, and before long, our public schools will be just as amazing as private schools that no one will have to dream of getting into Ateneo like Darwin did because our public schools will be just as incredible as Ateneo.
It may happen in the distant future, but as a teacher, I envision that it is possible to slowly change through the simple changes in the perspectives of my students.
Usually, we follow the saying, "To see is to believe." We need to see first in order to know or believe that it is possible.
But if you're a teacher, the saying should go, "To believe is to see." We need to believe first that our students are capable in order to truly see that they really can do it
And I have a story to tell.
I teach five classes that range from the middle to the lowest sections.
And - but in my class, I always say that "All of you are part of the first section.
All of you are the best." And I really believe in that and that's what I do.
And that's how I recognize them all.
All of them are the best.
That's why we had a goal in my class, that when I asked my class "What's your goal?" They would it already.
They would shout: "We will pass!" Okay!
They even hung a poster of that mantra in the room!
And when I ask, "What score?," they'll shout "Perfect!"
I noticed that most of the kids do not have a motivation because they felt that they can't do it.
That's why I wanted them to repeatedly profess that "We will pass," until they took it to heart and believed in it.
And as we talked, we came to discuss that if we had a goal as a call, we will do our best.
We have to aim high, that's why we have to get perfect.
For the entire year, we repeated it.
Everyday, we just tried and tried.
And even if we weren't always perfect, I noticed that slowly but surely the grades of my students were increasing, along with the slow but sure increase in their confidence in Science and English.
But there came a day that we, my students and I, considered the best day ever because that was the day we were able to reach our goal.
This was the middle class- the second to the lowest section in the school with around 50 students.
We had a quiz on conductors and insulators and (untillegible).
And when- always, when the quiz was finished, I always tally that.
I ask who got 10, 9, 8, 7, so that the class can see if we were able to reach our goal.
I asked:"How many got 10?" A lot of students raised their hands.
And so we were so happy.
I wrote it on the board.
"How many got 9?" Still a lot.
"How many got 8"? No one raised their hand.
When I asked who got 7, a lot again.
But when I asked 6 and below, no one raised their hand.
The class was silent.
I said: "The passing score is 7." Then, I was shocked because everybody suddenly stood up, laughed, clapped, because they were so happy.
And then Fyords adds: "Ma'am, my heart is thumping." He was like that.
He was just so happy.
And then I said, "Don't ever forget that feeling, the feeling that you're happy not just for yourself because you passed, but that because everyone passed.
Be happy for everyone.
We will all pass.
And we reached our goal." We reached our goal.
And when I saw my class, when I saw them believe in the greatness within them, I know that, little by little, there is change happening in this country.
I always say that if you want to really know your country, if you want to really understand it, "Come, teach in the public schools, because this is where most of our students are." And in every student, their lives and the lives of their parents, that you see everyday, mirrors the lives of most of our fellow Filipinos.
Their every success and their belief in themselves is a sucess, and it reverberates the return of the belief in the future of the Philippines.
Even if many say, that I am idealistic- my decision to teach in the public school, in my opinion, is so that I may spend my idealism something meaningful and something that I find important.
But if you think about it, isn't it more realistic to answer to the needs of your country, that are true?
In the end, whatever happens, I don't care if I'm idealistic or realistic.
What I know, what I know, is that as a public school teacher, it is imperative that I respond with nothing but love for my country and my students. Thank you very much.
This means, "I'm smiling."
So does that.
This means "mouse."
"Cat."
Here we have a story.
The start of the story, where this means guy, and that is a ponytail on a passer-by.
Here's where it happens.
These are when.
This is a cassette tape the girl puts into her cassette-tape player.
She wears it every day.
It's not considered vintage -- she just likes certain music to sound a certain way.
Look at her posture; it's remarkable.
That's because she dances.
Now he, the guy, takes all of this in, figuring,
"Honestly, geez, what are my chances?"
(Laughter)
And he could say, "Oh my God!" or "I heart you!"
"I'm laughing out loud."
"I want to give you a hug."
But he comes up with that, you know.
He tells her, "I'd like to hand-paint your portrait on a coffee mug."
(Laughter)
Put a crab inside it.
Add some water.
Seven different salts.
He means he's got this sudden notion to stand on dry land, but just panhandle at the ocean.
He says, "You look like a mermaid, but you walk like a waltz."
And the girl goes, "Wha'?"
So, the guy replies, "Yeah, I know, I know.
I think my heartbeat might be the Morse code for inappropriate.
At least, that's how it seems.
I'm like a junior varsity cheerleader sometimes -- for swearing, awkward silences, and very simple rhyme schemes.
Right now, talking to you, I'm not even really a guy.
I'm a monkey -- (Laughter) -- blowing kisses at a butterfly.
But I'm still suggesting you and I should meet.
First, soon, and then a lot.
I'm thinking the southwest corner of 5th and 42nd at noon tomorrow, but I'll stay until you show up, ponytail or not.
Hell, ponytail alone.
I don't know what else to tell you.
I got a pencil you can borrow.
You can put it in your phone."
But the girl does not budge, does not smile, does not frown.
She just says, "No thank you."
You know?
[ "i don't need 2 write it down." ] (Applause)
(Papaji) Please sit down and your question is...
A great question.
Can you show me God?
This is his question.
There are many questions come but this is the highest question that one could ask.
Can you show me God?
But I remember a story, same... same quest, same request.
A girl eight year old, came to me, asked me:
'Show me God.'
I told her,
'You go to school', she was about to leave for school, tomorrow I show you.
Then tomorrow came.
And then she said, 'Show me God.'
You promised yesterday. I said, 'Now your driver is waiting to take you to the school, you came back and later tomorrow
I'll show you.
And this morning I'm not going to to school.
You have to show me!'
So little child
I said, 'Okay. You come in the room, I will show you God.
But when you see God, you have to give something to him.
But you have got to give and then out of her school bag, she said, I take chocolate everyday.
My Mama gives chocolate to eat in the interval when the school is closed.
And I will give chocolate.
I say, 'Then you give the chocolate to God and he will come.
Then she said, Where is God first to give the chocolate.
I said you give the chocolate then only
Not that the God must come before you give the chocolate is in your hand.
You extend the hand and give it to God and they will take.
She was a child no doubt in her and she extend it.
Then there was a lot of noise in the room her mother was in the kitchen she came out.
Calling, 'Baby what happened?'
She said to her,
'Mom, I gave him chocolate to God.
And he took all of it and not even gave one half of it to me.
Even then,
I slapped on his face.
Slapped on his face, and then mother said 'You are lying, I don't see God.'
She said, 'Mama can't you see God.
See how he's loving me and hugging me.
I really don't understand why you can't see Him.
I am seeing, Papaji is seeing
Why can't you see?' Then her mother never agreed.
That her child is speaking.
Then she said, 'I will make a drawing because I cannot speak what is happening and what he is doing.
Then she made a very beautiful drawing of God which I never seen in any picture so far. And until then she always use to go walking with me.
Meditating with me.
Even she will tie a rope around my leg and and keep in her hand when she slept so what I want to tell you is.
It is innocence
God is everywhere.
Those who are not innocent cannot see him.
You can see God everywhere.
He is everywhere.
Why you can't see him?
The one who has a doubt cannot see him.
And if you don't have a doubt that God is everywhere.
Why can't you see him?
So the veil between you and God is only doubt.
That God is not seen
God cannot be seen.
God will be seen not by long penance in the cave of the himalayas.
And those people have doubts in their minds.
As this child could see, only instantly giving a piece of chocolate. You see? And now you extend your hand, when you go back to your room.
Give him the chocolate. Not having any doubt then tomorrow, day after tomorrow
You tell me, 'I gave the chocolate and he didn't eat.
You have to do it and then you come on Satsang on Monday.
And if you are innocent, have not doubt you will see what happen.
And now? Whom do you see?
Now it said, why tomorrow?
What do you see?
I don't see anything.
I told you, you are not to doubt.
Again, you say,
'I don't see' This is a doubt.
Remove this doubt.
This do... "Don't" is a doubt itself!
Again tell me, don't keep doubt in your mind.
And tell me, what do you see? I see God.
Ha? Is that simple?
[Laughter]
Come here.
It was so simple, it was so simple.
[Papaji hugs the man]
It was so simple isn't it?
When it comes to neighbors, most countries have several options: like North to Canada or South to Mexico.
But there are countries that don't have this freedom of choice, not because they're islands but because they're trapped in another country.
For example: tiny Vatican City, which fits inside of not just Italy, but also just Rome.
How Vatican City got surrounded is complicated, but not unique for there is also the Republic of San Marino, home to 30,000 citizens which Italy also completely surrounds.
Italy, apparently, is a country that likes countries in its country.
But trapping nations is not just Italy's thing for there's also Lesotho, in South Africa which is both the largest encircled country at 70 times Vatican City's size and the most populated with over 2,000,000 citizens.
The thing that makes these three countries' borders bizarre is that any path in or out must go through the one and only neighbor they have.
But now take a look at The Gambia, which excluding that tiny ocean border, is as surrounded as any nation can get.
If we amend the previous rule to every land route, now we've made a category of single-neighbored nations. Which includes all four of these and countries like Portugal, where the only way in or out is through Spain.
Who else is on this list?
Well, there's Monaco which must go through France, Qatar through Saudi Arabia Denmark through Germany, South Korea through North Korea (though South Korea might as well be an island nation for most practical travel purposes)
East Timor and Papua New Guinea both through Indonesia, Brunei through Malaysia
And there are two sets of twins: there is The Dominican Republic whose only neighbor is Haiti and Haiti, whose only neighbor is The Dominican Republic. And the second set is:
Ireland through the United Kingdom and the United Kingdom through
Ireland.
A side note here:
While there are tons of 'British' places around the world, some of which border other nations
-- these are not part of the United Kingdom.
It's complicated.
Though if you wanted to, you could argue that the United Kingdom technically dug a land border under the channel to the continent, presumably to be closer to France, her best friend ever.
Finally, there's one more country in this category:
Canada: the largest single-neighbored, nation in the world.

I like a Savior, that really got the job done.
And dealt with my sins.
If any man sins, we've got to remember, we've got an advocate, don't worry about what you've done or haven't done.
You've got to look to the Savior.
You've got an advocate.
Without Him we are in all sorts of trouble with the living God.
We've have got the best of lawyers.
He never lost a case.
He never failed.
Jesus Christ, the righteous.
No it's not a matter of what we've done, you couldn't go over there and join with those in the jungles of Africa and offer pigs and chicken for your sin; it wouldn't do you a bit of good.
You could go down on the Andes" Mountains and offer young virgins for your sin, that wouldn't do any good.
You could offer rivers of oil and thousands of beasts, and that wouldn't do any good Micah says.
You could go and win a thousand souls for Christ and that wouldn't do you any good, to find favor with God, to find a reprieve from God.
There is nothing, nothing!
And so we've got to come to Christ,
Nothing in my hand I bring, nothing Lord!
There is no hope of me ever standing before the living God, on that great day, apart from what you are and what you've done.
Christ and Him crucified, that's the glorious gospel.
It's not a matter of who did what, it's the matter of a person, and so we are putting our trust in Jesus Christ.
That person and what He did on the cross, Jesus Christ the righteous.
That's our confidence.
Ya, we've got a real good lawyer, we have Jesus Christ the righteous.
Who knew no sin, He did no sin, He had no sin, in Him there was no sin!
He walked a perfect life, He died a perfect death, He rose again with mighty power.
Jesus said "It's finished." (John 19:30) and God says "It's well done," and He raised Him from the grave.
Seated Him at His right hand, with all authority and put everything in His hand.
He's the man, Jesus from Nazareth, He's been given authority over all flesh to give eternal life to as many as the Father has given Him.
And I am saying "Lord Jesus, I trust, I believe, I do believe that you died for me."
"You really did propitiate and remove the wrath of God!"
"And bold shall I stand in that great day, because of what Jesus did."
Greater love has no man then this, that a man lay down his life for his friend.
That is the greatest manifestation of the love of God towards you as believer.
"Love so amazing, so divine, demands my life, my soul, my all!"
You know, that Jesus would personally die for me, personally."
C.T. Studd says "If Christ be God and died for me, there's no sacrifice to great for me to make for Him."
You've gotta flee from the wrath to come!
And say "Lord Jesus I believe, I believe you died for sinners, I believe you died for sinners just like me,
I'm headed for hell, with no reason you should take me to heaven, but I'm trusting that you died and really did pay that sin debt."
That's the gospel.
The good news... is that although I'm a sinner deserving of hell, I right now can stand perfect and have favor in the sight of God!
That's the good news.
Because of what Jesus did.
Glory to God! and Glory to the Lamb forever!
To Him be glory power, honor, and dominion forever and ever, because of what He did.

Episode 10
I will call you, Mother .
Seung Jo, take care of yourself.
I know, I know.
If you need anything, call me.
I don't need anything.
You have to come home once in a while, okay ?
I'm going Eun Jo.
Hyung. &lt;i&gt;He left.
He really left like that.
I was so happy about living in this house with Seung Jo...
Even if he's cold towards me...even if he's says things I don't like...
It was nice just being with him .
Ha Ni...don't cry.
Let's wait...
He didn't go far away.
So he'll come back really soon... &lt;i&gt;Now I can't see him anywhere but at school. &lt;i&gt;He'll probably... &lt;i&gt;Seung Jo will probably forget me.
Ha Ni!
Oh Ha Ni!
Hey!
Oh Ha Ni!
Huh?
Did you say something?
Please pull yourself together.
You've lost your mind.
Everyday for a week, you've been like an octopus without bones.
An octopus.
I understand that you're sad because Seung Jo left the house, but this is not my friend, Ha Ni.
Pull yourself together, okay ?
Oh!
It's Seung Jo.
What are you doing?
You missed him so much.

They say Baek Seung Jo left his house.
She's in shock.
Let's practice. &lt;i&gt;Seung Jo isn't coming for practice. &lt;i&gt;I already knew he wouldn't, but I was thinking maybe...
Hey, Oh Ha Ni!
You can't even pick up the balls properly?
Yes...
Ah really!
Ha Ni!
Do you feel like buying me dinner?
I don't.
Really?
That's a shame.

Let's practice.
I'll buy it, sunbae!
I'll buy it, sunbae!
I'll buy it, I'll buy it!
I know a good place.
Yes?
It's not an expensive place, so you don't need to be pressured.
Besides that... the information you were talking about...
Ah information.
As you may already know, Seung Jo doesn't hide anything from me.
So if I tell you, it's pretty good information.
After practice, I'll take you where Seung Jo is working part time.

Seung Jo
Hello!
Where do you live now?
I'm working now... Are you angry? Because I'm here?
I knew you'd come sooner or later, however don't be a tattle-tale about this. &lt;i&gt;Brought to you by the PKer team @ www.viikii.net
That's it!
What?
That!
If I do part-time here, I can very very casually... I can be with Seung Jo
But this is quite the opposite of casual.
Just a second.
Oh?
Part time?
Yes.
I'll do my best!
I'm sorry.
What to do?
Yes?
I just hired someone a minute ago, so the positions are all filled.
Yes?!
Sorry, but maybe next time.
You!
Why are you here?
A part time job. I see you're a second late.
Excuse me, don't you have any other positions?!
Sorry but we don't need any more right now.
Well then, please work hard starting today!
Looks like the tables have turned.
What is?
Ever since Seung Jo left his house, the only place you could meet Seung Jo is at the tennis club, right?
But then again Seung Jo barely ever goes.
I was in the same class and work in a part-time job in the same place as Seung Jo.
Goodness why do I keep feeling like I'm taking candy from you?
Well, I have to go to work so see you!
Oh gosh that was good.
Hey Ha Ni thanks to you, I really enjoyed my meal.
Oh right !
Did you get the part time job?
Great, it's all figured out then.
You have to be thankful to me.
It's all thanks to me. Let's go now.
You're leaving ma'am?
There's still the tea left in your set meal.
Oh!
Can you just save it for me for tomorrow?
Excuse me?!
The tea...
Can't I come back tomorrow and drink it?
We cannot do that.
And I am not thankful at all if you show up tomorrow as well.
I won't bother you.
In the end, I'm still a customer.
Hey!
Don't you dare tell my family.
Then does that mean I can come?
Busy, huh? Yeah, probably because there are a lot of customers. How is living alone?
I just can't leave feeling at ease when Hae Ra is always around.
I need to come tomorrow and the day after as well.
Ha Ni, what are you doing?
Lets go!
Anyway, I'm happy I could see Seung Jo.
I'm back home!
Oh! Ha Ni
You haven't eaten dinner yet have you? Come here, let's eat together
I already ate out. Oh my!
Ha Ni it's been a long time since I've seen you smile
Did something happen?
Huh?
No. Just...... You've been so sad since Seung Jo moved out.
Mother, Seung Jo is...
Don't you dare tell my family.
What!
Seung Jo is working part time at a family restaurant!
It was supposed to be a secret.
I had dinner there.
Oh my, oh my, it must have been so much fun!
I want to see it myself. Right Eun Jo?!
Seung Jo is a waiter!
I want to see him too
Then shall the three of us have dinner there tomorrow?
Huh?
But he said it was a secret...
Oh Ha Ni no need to be shy!
Alright then. How about all of us disguising ourselves?
We'll sit off to the side.
Yeah! &lt;i&gt; Seung Jo, what are you doing all by yourself? &lt;i&gt;Are you making dinner or are you reading a book? &lt;i&gt; Where in the world are you living right now?
I would like mushrooms and lotus leaves over rice, cabbage salad, and omija tea.
I would like abalone porridge, with grilled green tea mountain roots.
Blueberry sorbet after the meal. I would like diced hot rice cakes with vegetables.
And please don't add any pepper on my grilled salmon.
I would like the grilled rib steak with 6 pieces of lemon chicken, actually 8 pieces.
Instead of the abalone porridge, I would like the chicken breast.
He won't know if we all order like this, so let's clear it up.
What did you get?
Allow me to confirm your orders.
Mushroom and lotus leaves over rice, cabbage salad, and omija tea.
Grilled green tea mountain roots, and the rice cakes with vegetables.
Grilled salmon with no pepper.
Grilled chicken with orange sorbet. You forgot mine?
Yes, the blueberry sorbet after the meal.
That's all.
I don't think he even jotted it down.
He's so smart, he must have memorized it all!
Hyung, you're so cool!
He's definitely a prodigy.
But he's not very cute. My Seung Jo is cutest when he smiles.
Do you think Hyung has recognized us?
Hey Ha Ni, there's no way he could recognize us when we're disguised this well!
Excuse me!
Are you ready to order?
Should we eat the lotus leaf steak?
I want half lemon chicken half seasoned chicken.
I want to eat something I haven't tried.
Hurry up!
What is today's special?
Fried yam salad.
Oh I had that yesterday ...
Hey Ha Ni!
Idiot, Hyung probably already recognized us.
Is this you in disguise?
I'm sorry.
Oh it's Seung Jo's mother and Eun Jo.
Welcome.
Oh my gosh, why are you here?!
I work here part time with Seung Jo.
What?!
What were you doing, Ha Ni?!
I'm sorry. Yoon Hae Ra made a move first!
Son, come home once in awhile.
And be careful not to fall for Hae Ra, not at all!
I get it.
Seung Jo, come on and tell me where you live.
Hurry and leave!
Alright Ha Ni? You cannot lose to Hae Ra.
Don't you care what he says about you being persistent or tired of you.
You have to meet him everyday.
Stick to him like glue!
Come here every day, alright?
Yes!
There's nothing like a stalker.
My sad Hyung. Poor Seung Jo.
What?!
Really?!
Yeah, it looks like Hae Ra has attached herself to Seung Jo.
Hae Ra's pretty darn persistent too.
Now that this has happened, you have no choice but to go every day as well.
Don't you think Seung Jo will dislike it?
Oh my gosh!
What in the world are you talking about?!
It's Oh Ha Ni to happily go after him whether he runs away or doesn't like it.
Like a cicada that sticks to a tree like glue and cries all summer long!
Okay.
That's it!
A cicada stuck to a tree!
But the problem is...Do you have the time and money to go visit Seung Jo every single day?
Oh...
Are you renting this place?
Are you studying today again?
I have a paper that I have to turn in by next week.
I'll get the order here.
Ah...Okay.
Why did you purposely come?
It seemed like you were going to eat my friend.
What would you like?
Give me anything.
Yes, I understand.
Then, just a little bit...
The food you ordered has come out.
Could you please move your books?
What is this?
This is our restaurant's most popular Super Special Set.
This big...
Is this a duck?
Not a duck... a chicken.
Didn't you tell me to get you anything?
Then enjoy your meal.
Thank you, thank you!
Customer!
Should I give you a fifth cup of coffee?
If you drink six cups of black coffee everyday, your stomach will feel terrible.
Aigoo, thank you.
You even worry about me?
It's okay.
I'm nothing if not healthy.
What guy in this world would like a girl that sits here all day wasting her life away watching him.
If I were a guy, I'd probably get really tired of it.
Well anyways, work hard.
Even if you do that, see if I leave. &lt;i&gt;Brought to you by the PKer team @ www.viikii.net&lt;/i&gt;
Excuse me, customer!
Customer!
There isn't much time until we close.
Ah... yes. It's 123,000 won all together.
What's that expensive?
You had a Super Special Set and 7 cups of coffee.
Super... whatever it is... how much is it?
It is 58000 won.
A moment please.
Wait a moment please.
Here.
Yes.
Thank you.
Excuse me.
Until what time does Baek Seung Jo work?
Aye, tell me.
I'm not sure.
It's probably until 9 pm.
Ah, really?
Thank you. At 9 pm?
Since it's 8:30 now...
He should be getting off soon.
Good.
Today, I will go see where Seung Jo lives.
Of course, just slightly.
Were you waiting?
I just came out.
Really?
It is a relief.
Oh, I am tired.
-Let's hurry -Okay.
They're just going together because they live in the same area. It has to be like that.
What is this?
Seung Jo...
With Hae Ra...
Ha Ni!
What happened? Why are you so late?
I was worried. It's past midnight already.
I am sorry.
Was there a club meeting?
Did something happen?
No, everything is alright.
What about a bath?
Should I get the water ready for you?
I am just going to sleep today.
Good night.
Okay.
Good night.
Strange. &lt;i&gt;Seung Jo, who used to be right next door... &lt;i&gt;now lives with Hae Ra now. &lt;i&gt;What was all that talk about not hating me? &lt;i&gt;He doesn't hate me... &lt;i&gt;but he likes He Ra.
Is that it?
Right now, those two...
I'll be back.
Oh my, Ha Ni!
There are dark circles under your eyes!
And your eyes are swollen.
You look a bit sickly.
Really?
I couldn't sleep that well.
Aren't you studying too much?
That could never happen.
Are you okay?
What do you think about taking a day off of school today?
I'm okay.
If you feel worse, ask Seung Jo to bring you home.
If you show that face to our hyung, he'll probably faint.
He probably will. I better be careful.
Then, I'll be back.
Hey Ha Ni, what about breakfast?
I don't have an appetite.
Then.
What do you think happened to Ha Ni?
It seems like it's not something normal.
What could it be?
Ah, really! Are you on a diet?
Why aren't you eating these days?!
It's because I don't have an appetite...
What's the matter?
It's because of Baek Seung Jo, isn't it?
Tell us, we will listen.
I... think I'll just give up now.
Aigoo!
I've heard that more than a hundred times before.
Right?
My ears refuse to hear it.
But I really mean it this time...
What?!
Living together?!
Yoon Hae Ra and Beak Seung Jo?!
Didn't you see it wrong or something?
But still, staying at home together for more than one hour and not going out,
Wouldn't they be in that kind of relationship. . .
Seeing that it became like this,
I must have liked Seung Jo very much.
I could feel it all the way in my bones.
Crushes are really painful...
Ha Ni...
What to do?
Hello everyone.
1, 2, 3.
Back to the starting position!
1, 2, 3.
Back to the starting position!
1, 2, 3.
Hey Oh Ha Ni!
Won't you go back to your senses?!
Yes.
1, 2, 3.
Hey!
Baek Seung Jo!
Who are you?
"Who... Who are you?"
We've been around each other for so long, and you're saying you don't know who we are?
We are Oh Ha Ni's friends.
You have an IQ of 200 but you can't even remember that? We weren't in the same class, but we went to the same high school!
I immediately erase useless data out of my head, you know.
Ah, I remember!
The two who have the same level of brains as Oh Ha Ni,
Jung Joo Ri and...
Go Min Ah, right?
What's the matter?
Ah really, what did Ha Ni like about a guy like you...
You're right.
What did you want to say?
Hey!
Don't you think, you were too much?
It's about Ha Ni, do you know?
In the last 10 days she looks like she's been through hell and back!
As her friend, I can't just sit and watch her like this!
So what?
What is it you want to say?
Living together!
Living together?
What?
You want to stand here and deny it now?
That you are living together with Yoon Hae Ra!
Ha Ni said, she followed you two and saw everything with her own eyes!
Ha Ni, the poor thing,
Waited for more than one hour on the street!
Although you know about Ha Ni's feelings,
Did you have to leave home like this, and even live with another woman?
At least clear everything up first!
You're such a coward.
Don't fool around behind her back!
Be a man and tell her the truth!
Fine.
All I have to do is tell her the truth?
If you're too honest then it'll be bad for Ha Ni so...
She's a lot more sensitive than what she looks to be...
So what we're saying is to stop tormenting Ha Ni!
We're not telling you to stop liking Yoon Hae Ra.
You understand, right?
Tell her there's no hope and to give up.
Oh Ha Ni... has been in a one-sided love with you for 4 years.
That's what we wanted to say.
We'll get going now.
Let's go.
Here.
You were hungry right?
Wow!
This is abalone.
This is mountain root.
This is duck.
Here Ha Ni eat up, it's a treat from Joon Gu and us.
You have to take care of your body.
And find a new love.
That's right, Ha Ni.
Hey, that's not important.
Is he the only man in this world?
Look around you, there are so many gorgeous man out there...
You're right...
But I have no appetite...
You guys eat up.
Hey, Ha Ni...
You taking it this hard...
Is absolutely killing me.
You should eat a little. &lt;i&gt; I haven't seen Seung Jo in two weeks already. &lt;i&gt; Yeah... &lt;i&gt;Without me trying... &lt;i&gt;There was no way for us to meet like this.
What are you doing here?
Are you waiting for someone?
Long time no see...
I haven't seen you around lately.
Yeah that's right...
Then I'm going to go first.
Show some compassion.
Can't you sit with me while I wait for someone?
Well...I guess.
Well... how is it? The new house? Oh...
It's good.
The rooms are spacious.
Yeah...
What about meals?
Well,
Sometimes I eat at my part-time job.
Sometimes someone cooks for me. &lt;i&gt; C-cooks for him?
When you're suddenly living on your own, it must be quite lonely.
Well, it isn't even like that. For the most part,
I'm with Yoon Hae Ra quite often.
Ah... yeah...
Teacher!
I'm here!
You're good about being on time.
Coming to Parang University, which is my target...
I'm really starting to think that I need to study really hard. Omo!
This unnie... are you maybe Oh Ha Ni unnie?
Ah...
- How do you know me?
- I knew it!
She's exactly the way teacher Hae Ra described.
I can recognize her instantly.
I heard a lot about you.
Ah yes...
Huh?!
What did you hear about me?
I heard that you were the bottom of the school, but with the help of teacher Baek Seung Jo that you got into the top 50!
I heard that's still a legend!
Ah.
Well, yes...
Teacher!
Did you wait long?
No, I just came.
I'm getting English tutoring from Hae Ra teacher and math tutoring from Seung Jo teacher, because I'm going to take the entrance exam for this school.
Then your teachers...
They come over at least 3 times a week.
My mom loves them. She even cooks them meals all the time.
But, it seems like Hae Ra teacher and Ha Ni unnie are not that close.
Then.... the place you went in with Hae Ra... You weren't living together, right?
Live together?!
Making conclusions on your own basis...
It's a good part-time job because it takes care of dinner.
Let's go now.
Then, good-bye.
You were making chocolate??
You give chocolate to special people...
You... perhaps...
Oh my goodness!
Do you know how long I've been waiting for this moment?
It took too long, right?
It's seems like you came back to your own self now.
I was so worried because you kept looking so lifeless these last few days.
This time you really need to make things work.
Yes.
Fighting!
Fighting!
I just can't get it to taste right.
Although the taste is not that important ...
What's wrong...
Is it because I haven't been eating well for the past few days?
Did you make it?
It looks beautiful.
It must be delicious.
Should I put it on your finger?
Seung Jo...
It's even raining on a day like this and I didn't bring my umbrella.
Ahjusshi what's wrong?
What to do?
The car seems to be broken.
What?
Oh, Ha Ni came.
Seung Jo... I came.
On a day when it's raining this hard!
You're really an amazing person.
There's no use in waiting until Seung Jo has finished.
It seems things just get worse for you.
Today we tutor Ji Yeon.
Ah, it's coffee, right?
A lot of it? &lt;i&gt; When will I be able to give this to him? &lt;i&gt; Here is a little...
And anyhow, Hae Ra is here too.
What's with that face?
What's wrong with my face?
You don't look good.
You should get back home immediately.
I'm fine.
Customer?
Ha Ni?
Ha Ni?
Oh Ha Ni?
Ha Ni?
Oh Ha Ni?!
Hey!
Are you alright?
I'm sorry.
Causing trouble.
Will you be okay without calling an ambulance?
Seung Jo Shi already gave you first aid.
That's okay.
I'm better now.
Baek Seung Jo shi, is this a person you know?
Yes.
Is it?
Then both of you should get back home.
You should give this young lady a ride home.
Ah, no.
I'm really fine.
How can you leave by yourself with this situation?
Do as I say Seung Jo shi.
Yes.
I got it.
It seems that you'll leave alone.
I understand.
There is nothing I can do about it.
Getting bumped around by little Miss Trouble everyday, it must be painful.
Oh Ha Ni!
You are amazing.
Anyway take care of yourself.
I'm going.
I'm going.
There aren't many cars around here.
I think it would be hard to find a cab here.
Seung Jo, you're getting wet.
Come closer.
Don't go whining about being sick after getting wet so you can just get closer.
Seung Jo...
I'll just walk over to the station so you just go in.
It's a 30 minute walk to the station.
And with rain this harsh...
The trains might come to a halt like last time.
My apartment is 10 min away from here... You wanna come?
In my room, you can call mother and tell her to come here by car.
Wow!
It looks better than I expected.
What you even have a full kitchen?!
Here is...
The bathroom.
Hae Ra... came here too?
Here?
You're the first to come over.
How are you doing?
Now I'm okay.
That's what you get for drinking that much coffee on an empty stomach!
It would be amazing if you didn't get a stomachache.
I said I'm alright now.
Here, a towel.
Baek Seung Jo's smell.
What smell? it's brand new. &lt;i&gt;Brought to you by the PKer team @ www.viikii.net
Hello?
It's me, Seung Jo.
I'm at my home
Pardon?
I met her.
She came by my part time job.
She fainted after she drank a cup of coffee.
No, she seems fine right now. &lt;i&gt; The time for us being alone like this, will be over once Mother comes to pick me up. &lt;i&gt; Before that, I have to get a look at Seung Jo's bedroom.
We are together now.
Omo!
Really?!
Pardon?
Pardon?!
Are you joking now?
Mom?
Mom?!
Hello...?
Ah what?!
Hanging up like that.
Why?
What did she say?
She doesn't want to come because it's raining too much.
Huh?
She will pick us up tomorrow, so we have to stay here for the night.
That's what she said. &lt;i&gt;He's taking a shower, and from now on it will only be the 2 of us all night long. &lt;i&gt;Ah... &lt;i&gt;A situation that only arises in romance novels! &lt;i&gt; What should I do? &lt;i&gt; This happened before at Seung Jo's parents' house, but the situation is different now. &lt;i&gt;In this house, there is only the two of us! &lt;i&gt; There's also only one bed!
Hey!
Yes?
Are you going to take a shower?
Sh-shower?
Ah, yeah, then... I'll take a shower.
Are you nervous?
Nervous?
No way.
Not at all.
Put that on.
There's only my clothes.
If you don't like it then forget it.
Thank you. &lt;i&gt;I like this feeling of having my heart flutter like this. &lt;i&gt;This spot where Seung Jo was just at...Now I'm here. &lt;i&gt;Is Seung Jo waiting for me outside? &lt;i&gt;Tonight seems like a night that people only experience once in their lifetime.
Joong Gu, answer the phone!
Ah, yes. I understand.
Hello, this is So Pal Bok Noodles.
I'm calling from Seung Jo's house.
I'd like to speak to Ha Ni's father.
Ah, you are Baek Seung Jo's mother?
Oh my, then who would you be?
Joong Goo-goon?
Oh yes it's Bong Joon Gu.
But our chef is extremely busy right now.
Then listen carefully Joon Gu, and please make sure to tell Ha Ni's father.
Yes I got it.
Please tell me.
Ha Ni will be spending the night away from home tonight.
That he need not to worry.
She's going to sleep over at Seung Jo's house.
What?
I just thought it was better for her to stay there than to come home during these windy rains.
What...
What...What did you say?
Are you serious lady?!
H-ha Ni is going to sleep over at Seung Jo's home?!
Where is Baek Seung Jo now?
Omo, what to do... I don't know that.
But although I know it, I'm not gonna tell you~
What?!
Well then, I'm gonna hang up~
Excuse me, hello--
Ahjumma, don't hang up! Don't hang up!
What's the matter?
Ch-chef!
Do you know where that Baek Seung Jo lives?
How in the world would I know where Seung Jo lives!?
I only know that he's working at that family restaurant.
What's the name of the family restaurant?
I think they're selling Dak (Korean for "chicken") there, ah no, it was chicken, or something like that.
Is it Dak or Chicken?
I'm leaving first!
Hey!
Hey!
Baek Seung Jo!
Hey you!
Joon Gu!
I...
I enjoyed the shower.
Thank you.
Yeah. &lt;i&gt; So... &lt;i&gt; What are we gonna do from now on?
Who are you?
Hello?
Hello?
I wanted... to ask something...
At this restaurant... is there a guy called Seung Jo...
Seung Jo?
Baek Seung Jo?
I must find...
I must find...
Hello?
Sir?
Hello?
Excuse me!
I'm going to go to sleep.
Huh?
Yeah, it's already 12 o'clock...
Well then I will sleep on the floor, so you just sleep in the bed.
Of course.
What?
There's only one blanket. if you're cold, go to the closet
Pull out a coat of mine and go to sleep if you must.
Hey, usually in situations like this, you should say to the girl
"Hey, what are you saying, I'll sleep on the floor, so you can sleep in the bed."
Isn't that common sense?
I don't want to say something like that to you.
What did you say to a sick person?!
You're not even a human!
You crazy cold human!
What?
Hey...
Hey...
What is it? I hate the dark...
Can't we turn the lights on?
I can't sleep if it's not dark.
A ghost could come out...
Hey...
What now?
Aren't you cold?
Of course I'm cold.
Even my back is cold.
I'll just sleep on the floor.
It's fine, so just go to sleep! But still...
But it's cold... Okay!
I can sleep here too, right?
Wait!
Then...
I'll sleep on the floor...
It's fine!
If I do this, then you'll quiet down too!
Sleep!
Are you nervous?
Why do you keep asking that!
Nervous? Whatever.
I'm not.
Then what's that sound of you swallowing your spit?
Huh?
You're spending a night with me.
You never know if something could happen.
Like a kiss?
Or...
Something beyond that could happen.
You may look forward to it...
Sorry.
But I'm not going to do anything. Sleep well.
Good night. &lt;i&gt; It's like it all died down, &lt;i&gt; but I think I feel relieved. &lt;i&gt;But still, to not do anything while on a bed with a girl,&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;I wonder if Seung Jo feels numb towards women or something.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Maybe it's just because he doesn't see me as an attractive girl.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;That's it!&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;There's no way a girl like me...&lt;/i&gt;
Are you blaming yourself?
Blaming myself?
No...
I... Don't want to become what my mother thinks of me as.
Say something did happen between us tonight.
We'll totally be caught up in it. Then we'll forever be controlled by my mother.
That's all.
So...
So don't expect anything and just go to sleep. &lt;i&gt;That's right, he said he didn't dislike me. &lt;i&gt;For some reason I feel warm and happy. &lt;i&gt;Being able to sleep next to Seung Jo... &lt;i&gt;It's so precious I can't fall asleep. &lt;i&gt;Brought to you by the PKer team @ www.viikii.net&lt;/i&gt;
Baek Seung Jo!
Yoon Hae Ra!
One two!
It's fun. Go on. Alright.

My travels to Afghanistan began many, many years ago on the eastern border of my country, my homeland, Poland.
I was walking through the forests of my grandmother's tales.
A land where every field hides a grave, where millions of people have been deported or killed in the 20th century.
Behind the destruction, I found a soul of places.
I met humble people.
I heard their prayer and ate their bread.
Then I have been walking East for 20 years -- from Eastern Europe to Central Asia -- through the Caucasus Mountains,
Middle East,
North Africa,
Russia.
And I ever met more humble people.
And I shared their bread and their prayer.
This is why I went to Afghanistan.
One day, I crossed the bridge over the Oxus River.
I was alone on foot.
And the Afghan soldier was so surprised to see me that he forgot to stamp my passport.
But he gave me a cup of tea.
And I understood that his surprise was my protection.
So I have been walking and traveling, by horses, by yak, by truck, by hitchhiking, from Iran's border to the bottom, to the edge of the Wakhan Corridor.
And in this way I could find noor, the hidden light of Afghanistan.
My only weapon was my notebook and my Leica.
I heard prayers of the Sufi -- humble Muslims, hated by the Taliban.
Hidden river, interconnected with the mysticism from Gibraltar to India.
The mosque where the respectful foreigner is showered with blessings and with tears, and welcomed as a gift.
What do we know about the country and the people that we pretend to protect, about the villages where the only one medicine to kill the pain and to stop the hunger is opium?
These are opium-addicted people on the roofs of Kabul 10 years after the beginning of our war.
These are the nomad girls who became prostitutes for Afghan businessmen.
What do we know about the women 10 years after the war?
Clothed in this nylon bag, made in China, with the name of burqa.
I saw one day, the largest school in Afghanistan, a girls' school.
13,000 girls studying here in the rooms underground, full of scorpions.
And their love [for studying] was so big that I cried.
What do we know about the death threats by the Taliban nailed on the doors of the people who dare to send their daughters to school as in Balkh?
The region is not secure, but full of the Taliban, and they did it.
My aim is to give a voice to the silent people, to show the hidden lights behind the curtain of the great game, the small worlds ignored by the media and the prophets of a global conflict.
Thanks.
(Applause)
Two years ago, I was invited as an artist to participate in an exhibition commemorating 100 years of Islamic art in Europe.
The curator had only one condition:
I had to use the Arabic script for my artwork.
Now, as an artist, a woman, an Arab, or a human being living in the world in 2010, I only had one thing to say:
I wanted to say no. And in Arabic, to say "no," we say "no, and a thousand times no."
So I decided to look for a thousand different noes. on everything ever produced under Islamic or Arab patronage in the past 1,400 years, from Spain to the borders of China.
I collected my findings in a book, placed them chronologically, stating the name, the patron, the medium and the date.
Now, the book sat on a small shelf next to the installation, which stood three by seven meters, in Munich, Germany, in September of 2010.
Now, in January, 2011, the revolution started, and life stopped for 18 days, and on the 12th of February, we naively celebrated on the streets of Cairo, believing that the revolution had succeeded.
Nine months later I found myself spraying messages in Tahrir Square.
The reason for this act was this image that I saw in my newsfeed.
I did not feel that I could live in a city where people were being killed and thrown like garbage on the street.
So I took one "no" off a tombstone from the Islamic Museum in Cairo, and I added a message to it: "no to military rule." And I started spraying that on the streets in Cairo.
But that led to a series of no, coming out of the book like ammunition, and adding messages to them, and I started spraying them on the walls.
So I'll be sharing some of these noes with you.
No to a new Pharaoh, because whoever comes next should understand that we will never be ruled by another dictator.
No to violence:
Ramy Essam came to Tahrir on the second day of the revolution, and he sat there with this guitar, singing.
One month after Mubarak stepped down, this was his reward.
No to blinding heroes.
Ahmed Harara lost his right eye on the 28th of January, and he lost his left eye on the 19th of November, by two different snipers.
No to killing, in this case no to killing men of religion, because Sheikh Ahmed Adina Refaat was shot on December 16th, during a demonstration, leaving behind three orphans and a widow.
The Institute of Egypt was burned on December 17th, a huge cultural loss.
No to stripping the people, and the blue bra is to remind us of our shame as a nation when we allow a veiled woman to be stripped and beaten on the street, and the footprint reads,
"Long live a peaceful revolution," because we will never retaliate with violence.
No to barrier walls.
On February 5th, concrete roadblocks were set up in Cairo to protect the Ministry of Defense from protesters.
Now, speaking of walls, I want to share with you the story of one wall in Cairo.
A group of artists decided to paint a life-size tank on a wall.
It's one to one. In front of this tank there's a man on a bicycle with a breadbasket on his head.
To any passerby, there's no problem with this visual.
After acts of violence, another artist came, painted blood, protesters being run over by the tank, demonstrators, and a message that read,
"Starting tomorrow, I wear the new face, the face of every martyr.
I exist."
Authority comes, paints the wall white, leaves the tank and adds a message:
"Army and people, one hand.
Egypt for Egyptians."
Another artist comes, paints the head of the military as a monster eating a maiden in a river of blood in front of the tank.
Authority comes, paints the wall white, leaves the tank, leaves the suit, and throws a bucket of black paint just to hide the face of the monster.
So I come with my stencils, and I spray them on the suit, on the tank, and on the whole wall, and this is how it stands today until further notice.
Now, I want to leave you with a final no.
I found Neruda scribbled on a piece of paper in a field hospital in Tahrir, and I decided to take a no of
Mamluk Mausoleum in Cairo.

I totally want to blow you!
Just so you know, I'm gay now.
You were gay then.
I saw the look on that tight ends face the day after Prom.
Come in.
I was so excited to get your call.
I haven't seen you since graduation.
Weren't you Valedictorian?
I always loved you for your mind.
No.
I barely graduated.
Yah, but you always thought with your penis. which makes you smart in my book.
Ya, speaking of smart.
Wow, you're really doing well for yourself.
Ya, I guess all those years playing doctor with the neighborhood boys, finally paid off.
County Coroner.
So cool.
I'm making you a double Martini.
Are you trying to get me drunk?
I remember you weren't always so gay when you were drunk.
Ya, ya, ya. I'll have a drink.
I'll have a drink. Go make me a drink.
Make yourself comfortable sexy.
I'll be right back.
Feel free to ditch the pants.
Kidding.
Dirty or clean?
Uh huh.
Jesus christ!
You scared the...
Hello.
What's going on in there?
I see you met Potter.
He's my lab assistant.
We're working from home today.
Hi.
Hi.
I like to call him Hairy Potter.
You should see all that fur underneath that shirt.
Go ahead Potter.
Show him.
Really Susie?
Show him your fur.
Don't you just want to be Little Red Riding Hood skipping to Grandmother's house through that forrest?
But, you're not here to see him.
You're here to see me, right stud?
Have a seat with me on the couch.
Here are the stomach contents from the hooker.
Not now.
Go work someplace else!
So, what excuse are you going to use to see if I'm still as hot as I was in high school?
So,
I heard you did the autopsy on a friend of mine who died recently.
That party bear?
You knew him?
What a pity.
He was a cutie. whoa, whoa..
So, I was wondering if you knew how he died?
Come on, Wood!
Is that really why you're here?
Yeah.
Fuck.
I was hoping you had a head injury and thought you were straight.
Sort of a reversal of that straight English rugby player that had a freak gym accident and went into a coma.
And when he woke up, he thought he was a completely gay hairdresser.
Wood, I have been dying to suck that dick of yours for years.
It's the only thing I could think about since your call.
If, I let you suck it, will you tell me what I want to know?
Hell ya!
Ok!
Ok.
But you are probably going to need some help getting hard, right?
A little.
Potter, get in here!
Good idea.
Take your shirt off.
Strip for him!
Look, I told you before, I'm not a stripper.
I have a PHD.
Just do it!!
Faster!
I need music.
I can't do this without music.
For fuck sake!
Yes, I like that.
Alright
I like where you are going with that.
Ya, ya, ok, that's working.
I'm feeling Wood.
Ya, pants.
There we go!
Good job Potter.
Ya, dance for me.
Nice ass!
Do the "Cabbage patch".
Do the "Sprinkler" for me.
Do the "Swim".
You're a fish now.
You're a sexy fish.
You're my sexy little bitch fish.
That's what you are.
Ya, that'll...woo...
Do the Kylie Minogue.
Don't talk.
Don't ruin it.
Yes, yes!
And were off!!
Thank you!
So what happened to the guy?
She found traces of an odorless, fast-acting poison in J Cub's system.
Someone definitely had it out for him.
Chapter I. Down the Rabbit-Hole
Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the bank, and of having nothing to do: once or twice she had peeped into the book her sister was reading, but it had no pictures or conversations in it, 'and what is the use of a book,' thought Alice 'without pictures or conversation?'
So she was considering in her own mind (as well as she could, for the hot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid), whether the pleasure of making a daisy-chain would be worth the trouble of getting up and picking the daisies, when suddenly a White Rabbit with pink eyes ran close by her.
There was nothing so VERY remarkable in that; nor did Alice think it so VERY much out of the way to hear the Rabbit say to itself, 'Oh dear!
Oh dear!
I shall be late!' (when she thought it over afterwards, it occurred to her that she ought to have wondered at this, but at the time it all seemed quite natural); but when the Rabbit actually TOOK A WATCH OUT OF ITS WAlSTCOAT-
POCKET, and looked at it, and then hurried on, Alice started to her feet, for it flashed across her mind that she had never before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket, or a watch to take out of it, and burning with curiosity, she ran across the field after it, and fortunately was just in time to see it pop down a large rabbit-hole under the hedge.
In another moment down went Alice after it, never once considering how in the world she was to get out again.
The rabbit-hole went straight on like a tunnel for some way, and then dipped suddenly down, so suddenly that Alice had not a moment to think about stopping herself before she found herself falling down a very deep well.
Either the well was very deep, or she fell very slowly, for she had plenty of time as she went down to look about her and to wonder what was going to happen next.
First, she tried to look down and make out what she was coming to, but it was too dark to see anything; then she looked at the sides of the well, and noticed that they were filled with cupboards and book- shelves; here and there she saw maps and pictures hung upon pegs.
She took down a jar from one of the shelves as she passed; it was labelled 'ORANGE
MARMALADE', but to her great disappointment it was empty: she did not like to drop the jar for fear of killing somebody, so managed to put it into one of the cupboards as she fell past it.
'Well!' thought Alice to herself, 'after such a fall as this, I shall think nothing of tumbling down stairs!
How brave they'll all think me at home!
Why, I wouldn't say anything about it, even if I fell off the top of the house!'
(Which was very likely true.)
Down, down, down.
Would the fall NEVER come to an end!
'I wonder how many miles I've fallen by this time?' she said aloud.
'I must be getting somewhere near the centre of the earth.
Let me see: that would be four thousand miles down, I think--' (for, you see, Alice had learnt several things of this sort in her lessons in the schoolroom, and though this was not a VERY good opportunity for showing off her knowledge, as there was no one to listen to her, still it was good practice to say it over) '--yes, that's about the right distance--but then I wonder what Latitude or Longitude I've got to?' (Alice had no idea what Latitude was, or Longitude either, but thought they were nice grand words to say.) Presently she began again.
'I wonder if I shall fall right THROUGH the earth!
How funny it'll seem to come out among the people that walk with their heads downward!
The Antipathies, I think--' (she was rather glad there WAS no one listening, this time, as it didn't sound at all the right word) '--but I shall have to ask them what the name of the country is, you know.
Please, Ma'am, is this New Zealand or Australia?' (and she tried to curtsey as she spoke-- fancy CURTSEYlNG as you're falling through the air!
Do you think you could manage it?) 'And what an ignorant little girl she'll think me for asking!
No, it'll never do to ask: perhaps I shall see it written up somewhere.'
Down, down, down.
There was nothing else to do, so Alice soon began talking again.
'Dinah'll miss me very much to-night, I should think!' (Dinah was the cat.) 'I hope they'll remember her saucer of milk at tea-time.
Dinah my dear!
I wish you were down here with me!
There are no mice in the air, I'm afraid, but you might catch a bat, and that's very
like a mouse, you know. But do cats eat bats, I wonder?'
And here Alice began to get rather sleepy, and went on saying to herself, in a dreamy sort of way, 'Do cats eat bats?
Do cats eat bats?' and sometimes,
'Do bats eat cats?' for, you see, as she couldn't answer either question, it didn't much matter which way she put it.
She felt that she was dozing off, and had just begun to dream that she was walking hand in hand with Dinah, and saying to her very earnestly, 'Now, Dinah, tell me the truth: did you ever eat a bat?' when suddenly, thump! thump! down she came upon a heap of sticks and dry leaves, and the fall was over.
Alice was not a bit hurt, and she jumped up on to her feet in a moment: she looked up, but it was all dark overhead; before her was another long passage, and the White
Rabbit was still in sight, hurrying down it.
There was not a moment to be lost: away went Alice like the wind, and was just in time to hear it say, as it turned a corner, 'Oh my ears and whiskers, how late it's getting!'
She was close behind it when she turned the corner, but the Rabbit was no longer to be seen: she found herself in a long, low hall, which was lit up by a row of lamps hanging from the roof.
There were doors all round the hall, but they were all locked; and when Alice had been all the way down one side and up the other, trying every door, she walked sadly down the middle, wondering how she was ever to get out again.
Suddenly she came upon a little three- legged table, all made of solid glass; there was nothing on it except a tiny golden key, and Alice's first thought was that it might belong to one of the doors of the hall; but, alas! either the locks were too large, or the key was too small, but at any rate it would not open any of them.
However, on the second time round, she came upon a low curtain she had not noticed before, and behind it was a little door about fifteen inches high: she tried the little golden key in the lock, and to her great delight it fitted!
Alice opened the door and found that it led into a small passage, not much larger than a rat-hole: she knelt down and looked along the passage into the loveliest garden you ever saw.
How she longed to get out of that dark hall, and wander about among those beds of bright flowers and those cool fountains, but she could not even get her head through the doorway; 'and even if my head would go through,' thought poor Alice, 'it would be of very little use without my shoulders.
Oh, how I wish I could shut up like a telescope!
I think I could, if I only know how to begin.'
For, you see, so many out-of-the-way things had happened lately, that Alice had begun to think that very few things indeed were really impossible.
There seemed to be no use in waiting by the little door, so she went back to the table, half hoping she might find another key on it, or at any rate a book of rules for shutting people up like telescopes: this time she found a little bottle on it, ('which certainly was not here before,' said Alice,) and round the neck of the bottle was a paper label, with the words
'DRlNK ME' beautifully printed on it in large letters.
It was all very well to say 'Drink me,' but the wise little Alice was not going to do
THAT in a hurry.
'No, I'll look first,' she said, 'and see whether it's marked "poison" or not'; for she had read several nice little histories about children who had got burnt, and eaten up by wild beasts and other unpleasant things, all because they WOULD not remember the simple rules their friends had taught them: such as, that a red-hot poker will burn you if you hold it too long; and that if you cut your finger VERY deeply with a knife, it usually bleeds; and she had never forgotten that, if you drink much from a bottle marked 'poison,' it is almost certain to disagree with you, sooner or later.
However, this bottle was NOT marked 'poison,' so Alice ventured to taste it, and finding it very nice, (it had, in fact, a sort of mixed flavour of cherry-tart, custard, pine-apple, roast turkey, toffee, and hot buttered toast,) she very soon finished it off.
'What a curious feeling!' said Alice; 'I must be shutting up like a telescope.'
And so it was indeed: she was now only ten inches high, and her face brightened up at the thought that she was now the right size for going through the little door into that lovely garden.
First, however, she waited for a few minutes to see if she was going to shrink any further: she felt a little nervous about this; 'for it might end, you know,' said Alice to herself, 'in my going out altogether, like a candle.
I wonder what I should be like then?'
And she tried to fancy what the flame of a candle is like after the candle is blown out, for she could not remember ever having seen such a thing.
After a while, finding that nothing more happened, she decided on going into the garden at once; but, alas for poor Alice! when she got to the door, she found she had forgotten the little golden key, and when she went back to the table for it, she found she could not possibly reach it: she could see it quite plainly through the glass, and she tried her best to climb up one of the legs of the table, but it was too slippery; and when she had tired herself out with trying, the poor little thing sat down and cried.
'Come, there's no use in crying like that!' said Alice to herself, rather sharply; 'I advise you to leave off this minute!'
She generally gave herself very good advice, (though she very seldom followed it), and sometimes she scolded herself so severely as to bring tears into her eyes; and once she remembered trying to box her own ears for having cheated herself in a game of croquet she was playing against herself, for this curious child was very fond of pretending to be two people.
'But it's no use now,' thought poor Alice, 'to pretend to be two people!
Why, there's hardly enough of me left to make ONE respectable person!'
Soon her eye fell on a little glass box that was lying under the table: she opened it, and found in it a very small cake, on which the words 'EAT ME' were beautifully marked in currants.
'Well, I'll eat it,' said Alice, 'and if it makes me grow larger, I can reach the key; and if it makes me grow smaller, I can creep under the door; so either way I'll get into the garden, and I don't care which happens!'
She ate a little bit, and said anxiously to herself, 'Which way?
Which way?', holding her hand on the top of her head to feel which way it was growing, and she was quite surprised to find that she remained the same size: to be sure, this generally happens when one eats cake, but Alice had got so much into the way of expecting nothing but out-of-the-way things to happen, that it seemed quite dull and stupid for life to go on in the common way.
So she set to work, and very soon finished off the cake. &gt;
Chapter Il.
The Pool of Tears
'Curiouser and curiouser!' cried Alice (she was so much surprised, that for the moment she quite forgot how to speak good English); 'now I'm opening out like the largest telescope that ever was!
Good-bye, feet!' (for when she looked down at her feet, they seemed to be almost out of sight, they were getting so far off).
'Oh, my poor little feet, I wonder who will put on your shoes and stockings for you now, dears?
I'm sure I shan't be able!
I shall be a great deal too far off to trouble myself about you: you must manage the best way you can;--but I must be kind to them,' thought Alice, 'or perhaps they won't walk the way I want to go!
Let me see: I'll give them a new pair of boots every Christmas.'
And she went on planning to herself how she would manage it.
'They must go by the carrier,' she thought; 'and how funny it'll seem, sending presents to one's own feet!
And how odd the directions will look!
ALlCE'S RlGHT FOOT, ESQ.
HEARTHRUG,
NEAR THE FENDER, (WlTH ALlCE'S LOVE).
Oh dear, what nonsense I'm talking!'
Just then her head struck against the roof of the hall: in fact she was now more than nine feet high, and she at once took up the little golden key and hurried off to the garden door.
It was as much as she could do, lying down on one side, to look through into the garden with one eye; but to get through was more hopeless than ever: she sat down and began to cry again.
'You ought to be ashamed of yourself,' said Alice, 'a great girl like you,' (she might well say this), 'to go on crying in this way!
Stop this moment, I tell you!'
But she went on all the same, shedding gallons of tears, until there was a large pool all round her, about four inches deep and reaching half down the hall.
After a time she heard a little pattering of feet in the distance, and she hastily dried her eyes to see what was coming.
It was the White Rabbit returning, splendidly dressed, with a pair of white kid gloves in one hand and a large fan in the other: he came trotting along in a great hurry, muttering to himself as he came, 'Oh! the Duchess, the Duchess!
Oh! won't she be savage if I've kept her waiting!'
Alice felt so desperate that she was ready to ask help of any one; so, when the Rabbit came near her, she began, in a low, timid voice, 'If you please, sir--' The Rabbit started violently, dropped the white kid gloves and the fan, and skurried away into the darkness as hard as he could go.
Alice took up the fan and gloves, and, as the hall was very hot, she kept fanning herself all the time she went on talking:
'Dear, dear!
How queer everything is to-day!
And yesterday things went on just as usual.
I wonder if I've been changed in the night?
Let me think: was I the same when I got up this morning?
I almost think I can remember feeling a little different.
But if I'm not the same, the next question is, Who in the world am I?
Ah, THAT'S the great puzzle!'
And she began thinking over all the children she knew that were of the same age as herself, to see if she could have been changed for any of them.
'I'm sure I'm not Ada,' she said, 'for her hair goes in such long ringlets, and mine doesn't go in ringlets at all; and I'm sure I can't be Mabel, for I know all sorts of things, and she, oh! she knows such a very little!
Besides, SHE'S she, and I'm I, and--oh dear, how puzzling it all is!
I'll try if I know all the things I used to know.
Let me see: four times five is twelve, and four times six is thirteen, and four times seven is--oh dear!
I shall never get to twenty at that rate!
However, the Multiplication Table doesn't signify: let's try Geography.
London is the capital of Paris, and Paris is the capital of Rome, and Rome--no,
THAT'S all wrong, I'm certain!
I must have been changed for Mabel!
I'll try and say "How doth the little--"' and she crossed her hands on her lap as if she were saying lessons, and began to repeat it, but her voice sounded hoarse and strange, and the words did not come the same as they used to do:--
'How doth the little crocodile Improve his shining tail,
And pour the waters of the Nile On every golden scale!
'How cheerfully he seems to grin, How neatly spread his claws,
And welcome little fishes in With gently smiling jaws!'
'I'm sure those are not the right words,' said poor Alice, and her eyes filled with tears again as she went on, 'I must be Mabel after all, and I shall have to go and live in that poky little house, and have next to no toys to play with, and oh! ever so many lessons to learn!
No, I've made up my mind about it; if I'm Mabel, I'll stay down here!
It'll be no use their putting their heads down and saying "Come up again, dear!"
I shall only look up and say "Who am I then?
Tell me that first, and then, if I like being that person, I'll come up: if not,
I'll stay down here till I'm somebody else"--but, oh dear!' cried Alice, with a sudden burst of tears, 'I do wish they WOULD put their heads down!
I am so VERY tired of being all alone here!'
As she said this she looked down at her hands, and was surprised to see that she had put on one of the Rabbit's little white kid gloves while she was talking.
'How CAN I have done that?' she thought.
'I must be growing small again.'
She got up and went to the table to measure herself by it, and found that, as nearly as she could guess, she was now about two feet high, and was going on shrinking rapidly: she soon found out that the cause of this was the fan she was holding, and she dropped it hastily, just in time to avoid shrinking away altogether.
'That WAS a narrow escape!' said Alice, a good deal frightened at the sudden change, but very glad to find herself still in existence; 'and now for the garden!' and she ran with all speed back to the little door: but, alas! the little door was shut again, and the little golden key was lying on the glass table as before, 'and things are worse than ever,' thought the poor child, 'for I never was so small as this before, never!
And I declare it's too bad, that it is!'
As she said these words her foot slipped, and in another moment, splash! she was up to her chin in salt water.
Her first idea was that she had somehow fallen into the sea, 'and in that case I can go back by railway,' she said to herself.
(Alice had been to the seaside once in her life, and had come to the general conclusion, that wherever you go to on the English coast you find a number of bathing machines in the sea, some children digging in the sand with wooden spades, then a row of lodging houses, and behind them a railway station.)
However, she soon made out that she was in the pool of tears which she had wept when she was nine feet high.
'I wish I hadn't cried so much!' said Alice, as she swam about, trying to find her way out.
'I shall be punished for it now, I suppose, by being drowned in my own tears!
That WlLL be a queer thing, to be sure!
However, everything is queer to-day.'
Just then she heard something splashing about in the pool a little way off, and she swam nearer to make out what it was: at first she thought it must be a walrus or hippopotamus, but then she remembered how small she was now, and she soon made out that it was only a mouse that had slipped in like herself.
'Would it be of any use, now,' thought
Alice, 'to speak to this mouse?
Everything is so out-of-the-way down here, that I should think very likely it can talk: at any rate, there's no harm in trying.'
So she began:
'O Mouse, do you know the way out of this pool?
I am very tired of swimming about here, O Mouse!' (Alice thought this must be the right way of speaking to a mouse: she had never done such a thing before, but she remembered having seen in her brother's Latin Grammar,
'A mouse--of a mouse--to a mouse--a mouse-- O mouse!')
The Mouse looked at her rather inquisitively, and seemed to her to wink with one of its little eyes, but it said nothing.
'Perhaps it doesn't understand English,' thought Alice; 'I daresay it's a French mouse, come over with William the Conqueror.' (For, with all her knowledge of history, Alice had no very clear notion how long ago anything had happened.)
So she began again: 'Ou est ma chatte?' which was the first sentence in her French lesson-book.
The Mouse gave a sudden leap out of the water, and seemed to quiver all over with fright.
'Oh, I beg your pardon!' cried Alice hastily, afraid that she had hurt the poor animal's feelings.
'I quite forgot you didn't like cats.'
'Not like cats!' cried the Mouse, in a shrill, passionate voice.
'Would YOU like cats if you were me?' 'Well, perhaps not,' said Alice in a soothing tone: 'don't be angry about it.
And yet I wish I could show you our cat Dinah: I think you'd take a fancy to cats if you could only see her.
She is such a dear quiet thing,' Alice went on, half to herself, as she swam lazily about in the pool, 'and she sits purring so nicely by the fire, licking her paws and washing her face--and she is such a nice soft thing to nurse--and she's such a capital one for catching mice--oh, I beg your pardon!' cried Alice again, for this time the Mouse was bristling all over, and she felt certain it must be really offended.
'We won't talk about her any more if you'd rather not.'
'We indeed!' cried the Mouse, who was trembling down to the end of his tail.
'As if I would talk on such a subject!
Our family always HATED cats: nasty, low, vulgar things!
Don't let me hear the name again!'
'I won't indeed!' said Alice, in a great hurry to change the subject of conversation.
'Are you--are you fond--of--of dogs?'
The Mouse did not answer, so Alice went on eagerly:
'There is such a nice little dog near our house I should like to show you!
A little bright-eyed terrier, you know, with oh, such long curly brown hair!
And it'll fetch things when you throw them, and it'll sit up and beg for its dinner, and all sorts of things--I can't remember half of them--and it belongs to a farmer, you know, and he says it's so useful, it's worth a hundred pounds!
He says it kills all the rats and--oh dear!' cried Alice in a sorrowful tone,
'I'm afraid I've offended it again!'
For the Mouse was swimming away from her as hard as it could go, and making quite a commotion in the pool as it went.
So she called softly after it, 'Mouse dear!
Do come back again, and we won't talk about cats or dogs either, if you don't like them!'
When the Mouse heard this, it turned round and swam slowly back to her: its face was quite pale (with passion, Alice thought), and it said in a low trembling voice, 'Let us get to the shore, and then I'll tell you my history, and you'll understand why it is I hate cats and dogs.'
It was high time to go, for the pool was getting quite crowded with the birds and animals that had fallen into it: there were a Duck and a Dodo, a Lory and an Eaglet, and several other curious creatures.
Alice led the way, and the whole party swam to the shore. &gt;
Chapter ill.
A Caucus-Race and a Long Tale
They were indeed a queer-looking party that assembled on the bank--the birds with draggled feathers, the animals with their fur clinging close to them, and all dripping wet, cross, and uncomfortable.
The first question of course was, how to get dry again: they had a consultation about this, and after a few minutes it seemed quite natural to Alice to find herself talking familiarly with them, as if she had known them all her life.
Indeed, she had quite a long argument with the Lory, who at last turned sulky, and would only say, 'I am older than you, and must know better'; and this Alice would not allow without knowing how old it was, and, as the Lory positively refused to tell its age, there was no more to be said.
At last the Mouse, who seemed to be a person of authority among them, called out,
'Sit down, all of you, and listen to me!
I'LL soon make you dry enough!'
They all sat down at once, in a large ring, with the Mouse in the middle.
Alice kept her eyes anxiously fixed on it, for she felt sure she would catch a bad cold if she did not get dry very soon.
'Ahem!' said the Mouse with an important air, 'are you all ready?
This is the driest thing I know.
Silence all round, if you please!
"William the Conqueror, whose cause was favoured by the pope, was soon submitted to by the English, who wanted leaders, and had been of late much accustomed to usurpation and conquest.
Edwin and Morcar, the earls of Mercia and Northumbria--"'
'Ugh!' said the Lory, with a shiver.
'I beg your pardon!' said the Mouse, frowning, but very politely:
'Did you speak?' 'Not I!' said the Lory hastily.
'I thought you did,' said the Mouse.
'--I proceed.
"Edwin and Morcar, the earls of Mercia and
Northumbria, declared for him: and even Stigand, the patriotic archbishop of
Canterbury, found it advisable--"'
'Found WHAT?' said the Duck.
'Found IT,' the Mouse replied rather crossly: 'of course you know what "it" means.'
The question is, what did the archbishop find?'
The Mouse did not notice this question, but hurriedly went on, '"--found it advisable to go with Edgar Atheling to meet William and offer him the crown.
William's conduct at first was moderate.
But the insolence of his Normans--" How are you getting on now, my dear?' it continued, turning to Alice as it spoke.
'As wet as ever,' said Alice in a melancholy tone: 'it doesn't seem to dry me at all.'
'In that case,' said the Dodo solemnly, rising to its feet, 'I move that the meeting adjourn, for the immediate adoption of more energetic remedies--'
'Speak English!' said the Eaglet.
'I don't know the meaning of half those long words, and, what's more, I don't believe you do either!'
And the Eaglet bent down its head to hide a smile: some of the other birds tittered audibly.
'What I was going to say,' said the Dodo in an offended tone, 'was, that the best thing to get us dry would be a Caucus-race.'
'What IS a Caucus-race?' said Alice; not that she wanted much to know, but the Dodo had paused as if it thought that SOMEBODY ought to speak, and no one else seemed inclined to say anything.
'Why,' said the Dodo, 'the best way to explain it is to do it.' (And, as you might like to try the thing yourself, some winter day, I will tell you how the Dodo managed it.)
First it marked out a race-course, in a sort of circle, ('the exact shape doesn't matter,' it said,) and then all the party were placed along the course, here and there.
There was no 'One, two, three, and away,' but they began running when they liked, and left off when they liked, so that it was not easy to know when the race was over.
However, when they had been running half an hour or so, and were quite dry again, the
Dodo suddenly called out 'The race is over!' and they all crowded round it, panting, and asking, 'But who has won?'
This question the Dodo could not answer without a great deal of thought, and it sat for a long time with one finger pressed upon its forehead (the position in which you usually see Shakespeare, in the pictures of him), while the rest waited in silence.
At last the Dodo said, 'EVERYBODY has won, and all must have prizes.'
'But who is to give the prizes?' quite a chorus of voices asked.
'Why, SHE, of course,' said the Dodo, pointing to Alice with one finger; and the whole party at once crowded round her, calling out in a confused way, 'Prizes!
Prizes!'
Alice had no idea what to do, and in despair she put her hand in her pocket, and pulled out a box of comfits, (luckily the salt water had not got into it), and handed them round as prizes.
There was exactly one a-piece all round.
'But she must have a prize herself, you know,' said the Mouse.
'Of course,' the Dodo replied very gravely.
'What else have you got in your pocket?' he went on, turning to Alice.
'Only a thimble,' said Alice sadly.
'Hand it over here,' said the Dodo.
Then they all crowded round her once more, while the Dodo solemnly presented the thimble, saying 'We beg your acceptance of this elegant thimble'; and, when it had finished this short speech, they all cheered.
Alice thought the whole thing very absurd, but they all looked so grave that she did not dare to laugh; and, as she could not think of anything to say, she simply bowed, and took the thimble, looking as solemn as she could.
The next thing was to eat the comfits: this caused some noise and confusion, as the large birds complained that they could not taste theirs, and the small ones choked and had to be patted on the back.
However, it was over at last, and they sat down again in a ring, and begged the Mouse to tell them something more.
'You promised to tell me your history, you know,' said Alice, 'and why it is you hate-
-C and D,' she added in a whisper, half afraid that it would be offended again.
'Mine is a long and a sad tale!' said the Mouse, turning to Alice, and sighing.
'It IS a long tail, certainly,' said Alice, looking down with wonder at the Mouse's tail; 'but why do you call it sad?'
And she kept on puzzling about it while the Mouse was speaking, so that her idea of the tale was something like this:--
'Fury said to a mouse, That he met in the house,
"Let us both go to law: I will prosecute YOU.--Come,
I'll take no denial; We must have a trial:
For really this morning I've nothing to do."
Said the mouse to the cur, "Such a trial, dear Sir,
With no jury or judge, would be wasting our breath."
"I'll be judge, I'll be jury,"
Said cunning old Fury:
"I'll try the whole cause, and condemn you to death."'
'You are not attending!' said the Mouse to Alice severely.
'What are you thinking of?'
'I beg your pardon,' said Alice very humbly: 'you had got to the fifth bend, I think?' 'I had NOT!' cried the Mouse, sharply and very angrily.
'A knot!' said Alice, always ready to make herself useful, and looking anxiously about her.
'Oh, do let me help to undo it!'
'I shall do nothing of the sort,' said the Mouse, getting up and walking away.
'You insult me by talking such nonsense!' 'I didn't mean it!' pleaded poor Alice.
'But you're so easily offended, you know!'
The Mouse only growled in reply.
'Please come back and finish your story!'
Alice called after it; and the others all joined in chorus, 'Yes, please do!' but the
Mouse only shook its head impatiently, and walked a little quicker.
'What a pity it wouldn't stay!' sighed the Lory, as soon as it was quite out of sight; and an old Crab took the opportunity of saying to her daughter 'Ah, my dear!
Let this be a lesson to you never to lose YOUR temper!'
'Hold your tongue, Ma!' said the young Crab, a little snappishly.
'You're enough to try the patience of an oyster!'
'I wish I had our Dinah here, I know I do!' said Alice aloud, addressing nobody in particular.
'She'd soon fetch it back!' 'And who is Dinah, if I might venture to ask the question?' said the Lory.
Alice replied eagerly, for she was always ready to talk about her pet:
'Dinah's our cat.
And she's such a capital one for catching mice you can't think!
And oh, I wish you could see her after the birds!
Why, she'll eat a little bird as soon as look at it!'
This speech caused a remarkable sensation among the party.
Some of the birds hurried off at once: one old Magpie began wrapping itself up very carefully, remarking, 'I really must be getting home; the night-air doesn't suit my throat!' and a Canary called out in a trembling voice to its children, 'Come away, my dears!
It's high time you were all in bed!'
On various pretexts they all moved off, and
Alice was soon left alone.
'I wish I hadn't mentioned Dinah!' she said to herself in a melancholy tone.
'Nobody seems to like her, down here, and I'm sure she's the best cat in the world!
Oh, my dear Dinah!
I wonder if I shall ever see you any more!'
And here poor Alice began to cry again, for she felt very lonely and low-spirited.
In a little while, however, she again heard a little pattering of footsteps in the distance, and she looked up eagerly, half hoping that the Mouse had changed his mind, and was coming back to finish his story. &gt;
Chapter IV.
The Rabbit Sends in a Little Bill
It was the White Rabbit, trotting slowly back again, and looking anxiously about as it went, as if it had lost something; and she heard it muttering to itself 'The
Duchess!
The Duchess!
Oh my dear paws!
Oh my fur and whiskers!
Where CAN I have dropped them, I wonder?'
Alice guessed in a moment that it was looking for the fan and the pair of white kid gloves, and she very good-naturedly began hunting about for them, but they were nowhere to be seen--everything seemed to have changed since her swim in the pool, and the great hall, with the glass table and the little door, had vanished completely.
Very soon the Rabbit noticed Alice, as she went hunting about, and called out to her in an angry tone, 'Why, Mary Ann, what ARE you doing out here?
Run home this moment, and fetch me a pair of gloves and a fan!
Quick, now!'
And Alice was so much frightened that she ran off at once in the direction it pointed to, without trying to explain the mistake it had made.
'He took me for his housemaid,' she said to herself as she ran.
'How surprised he'll be when he finds out who I am!
But I'd better take him his fan and gloves- -that is, if I can find them.'
As she said this, she came upon a neat little house, on the door of which was a bright brass plate with the name 'W.
RABBlT' engraved upon it.
She went in without knocking, and hurried upstairs, in great fear lest she should meet the real Mary Ann, and be turned out of the house before she had found the fan and gloves.
'How queer it seems,' Alice said to herself, 'to be going messages for a rabbit!
I suppose Dinah'll be sending me on messages next!'
And she began fancying the sort of thing that would happen: '"Miss Alice!
Come here directly, and get ready for your walk!"
"Coming in a minute, nurse!
But I've got to see that the mouse doesn't get out."
Only I don't think,' Alice went on, 'that they'd let Dinah stop in the house if it began ordering people about like that!'
By this time she had found her way into a tidy little room with a table in the window, and on it (as she had hoped) a fan and two or three pairs of tiny white kid gloves: she took up the fan and a pair of the gloves, and was just going to leave the room, when her eye fell upon a little bottle that stood near the looking-glass.
There was no label this time with the words 'DRlNK ME,' but nevertheless she uncorked it and put it to her lips.
'I know SOMETHlNG interesting is sure to happen,' she said to herself, 'whenever I eat or drink anything; so I'll just see what this bottle does.
I do hope it'll make me grow large again, for really I'm quite tired of being such a tiny little thing!'
It did so indeed, and much sooner than she had expected: before she had drunk half the bottle, she found her head pressing against the ceiling, and had to stoop to save her neck from being broken.
She hastily put down the bottle, saying to herself 'That's quite enough--I hope I shan't grow any more--As it is, I can't get out at the door--I do wish I hadn't drunk quite so much!'
Alas! it was too late to wish that!
She went on growing, and growing, and very soon had to kneel down on the floor: in another minute there was not even room for this, and she tried the effect of lying down with one elbow against the door, and the other arm curled round her head.
Still she went on growing, and, as a last resource, she put one arm out of the window, and one foot up the chimney, and said to herself 'Now I can do no more, whatever happens.
What WlLL become of me?'
Luckily for Alice, the little magic bottle had now had its full effect, and she grew no larger: still it was very uncomfortable, and, as there seemed to be no sort of chance of her ever getting out of the room again, no wonder she felt unhappy.
'It was much pleasanter at home,' thought poor Alice, 'when one wasn't always growing larger and smaller, and being ordered about by mice and rabbits.
I almost wish I hadn't gone down that rabbit-hole--and yet--and yet--it's rather curious, you know, this sort of life!
I do wonder what CAN have happened to me!
When I used to read fairy-tales, I fancied that kind of thing never happened, and now here I am in the middle of one!
There ought to be a book written about me, that there ought!
And when I grow up, I'll write one--but I'm grown up now,' she added in a sorrowful tone; 'at least there's no room to grow up any more HERE.'
'But then,' thought Alice, 'shall I NEVER get any older than I am now?
That'll be a comfort, one way--never to be an old woman--but then--always to have lessons to learn!
Oh, I shouldn't like THAT!' 'Oh, you foolish Alice!' she answered herself.
'How can you learn lessons in here?
Why, there's hardly room for YOU, and no room at all for any lesson-books!'
And so she went on, taking first one side and then the other, and making quite a conversation of it altogether; but after a few minutes she heard a voice outside, and stopped to listen.
'Mary Ann!
Mary Ann!' said the voice.
Then came a little pattering of feet on the stairs.
Alice knew it was the Rabbit coming to look for her, and she trembled till she shook the house, quite forgetting that she was now about a thousand times as large as the
Rabbit, and had no reason to be afraid of it.
Presently the Rabbit came up to the door, and tried to open it; but, as the door opened inwards, and Alice's elbow was pressed hard against it, that attempt proved a failure.
Alice heard it say to itself 'Then I'll go round and get in at the window.'
'THAT you won't' thought Alice, and, after waiting till she fancied she heard the
Rabbit just under the window, she suddenly spread out her hand, and made a snatch in the air.
She did not get hold of anything, but she heard a little shriek and a fall, and a crash of broken glass, from which she concluded that it was just possible it had fallen into a cucumber-frame, or something of the sort.
Next came an angry voice--the Rabbit's-- 'Pat!
Pat!
Where are you?'
And then a voice she had never heard before, 'Sure then I'm here!
Digging for apples, yer honour!'
'Digging for apples, indeed!' said the Rabbit angrily.
'Here!
Come and help me out of THlS!' (Sounds of more broken glass.)
'Now tell me, Pat, what's that in the window?'
'Sure, it's an arm, yer honour!' (He pronounced it 'arrum.')
'An arm, you goose!
Who ever saw one that size?
Why, it fills the whole window!'
'Sure, it does, yer honour: but it's an arm for all that.'
'Well, it's got no business there, at any rate: go and take it away!'
There was a long silence after this, and Alice could only hear whispers now and then; such as, 'Sure, I don't like it, yer honour, at all, at all!'
'Do as I tell you, you coward!' and at last she spread out her hand again, and made another snatch in the air.
This time there were TWO little shrieks, and more sounds of broken glass.
'What a number of cucumber-frames there must be!' thought Alice.
'I wonder what they'll do next! As for pulling me out of the window, I only wish they COULD!
I'm sure I don't want to stay in here any longer!'
She waited for some time without hearing anything more: at last came a rumbling of little cartwheels, and the sound of a good many voices all talking together: she made out the words:
'Where's the other ladder?
--Why, I hadn't to bring but one; Bill's got the other--Bill! fetch it here, lad!
--Here, put 'em up at this corner--No, tie 'em together first--they don't reach half high enough yet--Oh! they'll do well enough; don't be particular--Here, Bill! catch hold of this rope--Will the roof bear?
--Mind that loose slate--Oh, it's coming down!
Heads below!' (a loud crash)--'Now, who did that? --It was Bill, I fancy--Who's to go down the chimney?
--Nay, I shan't!
YOU do it!
--That I won't, then!
--Bill's to go down--Here, Bill! the master says you're to go down the chimney!' 'Oh!
So Bill's got to come down the chimney, has he?' said Alice to herself.
'Shy, they seem to put everything upon Bill!
I wouldn't be in Bill's place for a good deal: this fireplace is narrow, to be sure; but I THlNK I can kick a little!'
She drew her foot as far down the chimney as she could, and waited till she heard a little animal (she couldn't guess of what sort it was) scratching and scrambling about in the chimney close above her: then, saying to herself 'This is Bill,' she gave one sharp kick, and waited to see what would happen next.
The first thing she heard was a general chorus of 'There goes Bill!' then the
Rabbit's voice along--'Catch him, you by the hedge!' then silence, and then another confusion of voices--'Hold up his head--
Brandy now--Don't choke him--How was it, old fellow?
What happened to you?
Tell us all about it!'
Last came a little feeble, squeaking voice, ('That's Bill,' thought Alice,) 'Well, I hardly know--No more, thank ye; I'm better now--but I'm a deal too flustered to tell you--all I know is, something comes at me like a Jack-in-the-box, and up I goes like a sky-rocket!'
'So you did, old fellow!' said the others. 'We must burn the house down!' said the Rabbit's voice; and Alice called out as If they had any sense, they'd take the roof off.'
There was a dead silence instantly, and Alice thought to herself, 'I wonder what they WlLL do next!
After a minute or two, they began moving about again, and Alice heard the Rabbit say, 'A barrowful will do, to begin with.'
'A barrowful of WHAT?' thought Alice; but she had not long to doubt, for the next moment a shower of little pebbles came rattling in at the window, and some of them hit her in the face.
'I'll put a stop to this,' she said to herself, and shouted out, 'You'd better not do that again!' which produced another dead silence.
Alice noticed with some surprise that the pebbles were all turning into little cakes as they lay on the floor, and a bright idea came into her head.
'If I eat one of these cakes,' she thought, 'it's sure to make SOME change in my size; and as it can't possibly make me larger, it must make me smaller, I suppose.'
So she swallowed one of the cakes, and was delighted to find that she began shrinking directly.
As soon as she was small enough to get through the door, she ran out of the house, and found quite a crowd of little animals and birds waiting outside.
The poor little Lizard, Bill, was in the middle, being held up by two guinea-pigs, who were giving it something out of a bottle.
They all made a rush at Alice the moment she appeared; but she ran off as hard as she could, and soon found herself safe in a thick wood.
'The first thing I've got to do,' said Alice to herself, as she wandered about in the wood, 'is to grow to my right size again; and the second thing is to find my way into that lovely garden.
I think that will be the best plan.'
It sounded an excellent plan, no doubt, and very neatly and simply arranged; the only difficulty was, that she had not the smallest idea how to set about it; and while she was peering about anxiously among the trees, a little sharp bark just over her head made her look up in a great hurry.
An enormous puppy was looking down at her with large round eyes, and feebly stretching out one paw, trying to touch her.
'Poor little thing!' said Alice, in a coaxing tone, and she tried hard to whistle to it; but she was terribly frightened all the time at the thought that it might be hungry, in which case it would be very likely to eat her up in spite of all her coaxing.
Hardly knowing what she did, she picked up a little bit of stick, and held it out to the puppy; whereupon the puppy jumped into the air off all its feet at once, with a yelp of delight, and rushed at the stick, and made believe to worry it; then Alice dodged behind a great thistle, to keep herself from being run over; and the moment she appeared on the other side, the puppy made another rush at the stick, and tumbled head over heels in its hurry to get hold of it; then Alice, thinking it was very like having a game of play with a cart-horse, and expecting every moment to be trampled under its feet, ran round the thistle again; then the puppy began a series of short charges at the stick, running a very
This seemed to Alice a good opportunity for making her escape; so she set off at once, and ran till she was quite tired and out of breath, and till the puppy's bark sounded quite faint in the distance.
'And yet what a dear little puppy it was!' said Alice, as she leant against a buttercup to rest herself, and fanned herself with one of the leaves: 'I should have liked teaching it tricks very much, if--if I'd only been the right size to do it!
I'd nearly forgotten that I've got to grow up again!
Let me see--how IS it to be managed?
I suppose I ought to eat or drink something or other; but the great question is, what?' The great question certainly was, what?
Alice looked all round her at the flowers and the blades of grass, but she did not see anything that looked like the right thing to eat or drink under the circumstances.
There was a large mushroom growing near her, about the same height as herself; and when she had looked under it, and on both sides of it, and behind it, it occurred to her that she might as well look and see what was on the top of it.
She stretched herself up on tiptoe, and peeped over the edge of the mushroom, and her eyes immediately met those of a large caterpillar, that was sitting on the top with its arms folded, quietly smoking a long hookah, and taking not the smallest notice of her or of anything else. &gt;
Chapter V. Advice from a Caterpillar
The Caterpillar and Alice looked at each other for some time in silence: at last the
Caterpillar took the hookah out of its mouth, and addressed her in a languid, sleepy voice.
'Who are YOU?' said the Caterpillar.
This was not an encouraging opening for a conversation.
Alice replied, rather shyly, 'I--I hardly know, sir, just at present--at least I know who I WAS when I got up this morning, but I think I must have been changed several times since then.'
'What do you mean by that?' said the Caterpillar sternly.
'Explain yourself!'
'I can't explain MYSELF, I'm afraid, sir' said Alice, 'because I'm not myself, you see.' 'I don't see,' said the Caterpillar.
'I'm afraid I can't put it more clearly,' Alice replied very politely, 'for I can't understand it myself to begin with; and being so many different sizes in a day is very confusing.'
'It isn't,' said the Caterpillar.
'Well, perhaps you haven't found it so yet,' said Alice; 'but when you have to turn into a chrysalis--you will some day, you know--and then after that into a butterfly, I should think you'll feel it a little queer, won't you?'
'Not a bit,' said the Caterpillar.
'Well, perhaps your feelings may be different,' said Alice; 'all I know is, it would feel very queer to ME.' 'You!' said the Caterpillar contemptuously.
'Who are YOU?'
Which brought them back again to the beginning of the conversation.
Alice felt a little irritated at the Caterpillar's making such VERY short remarks, and she drew herself up and said, very gravely, 'I think, you ought to tell me who YOU are, first.'
'Why?' said the Caterpillar.
Here was another puzzling question; and as Alice could not think of any good reason, and as the Caterpillar seemed to be in a VERY unpleasant state of mind, she turned away.
'Come back!' the Caterpillar called after her.
'I've something important to say!' This sounded promising, certainly:
Alice turned and came back again.
'Keep your temper,' said the Caterpillar.
'Is that all?' said Alice, swallowing down her anger as well as she could.
'No,' said the Caterpillar.
Alice thought she might as well wait, as she had nothing else to do, and perhaps after all it might tell her something worth hearing.
For some minutes it puffed away without speaking, but at last it unfolded its arms, took the hookah out of its mouth again, and said, 'So you think you're changed, do you?'
'I'm afraid I am, sir,' said Alice; 'I can't remember things as I used--and I don't keep the same size for ten minutes together!'
'Can't remember WHAT things?' said the Caterpillar.
'Well, I've tried to say "HOW DOTH THE LlTTLE BUSY BEE," but it all came different!'
Alice replied in a very melancholy voice. 'Repeat, "YOU ARE OLD, FATHER WlLLlAM,"' said the Caterpillar.
Alice folded her hands, and began:-- 'You are old, Father William,' the young man said, 'And your hair has become very white;
And yet you incessantly stand on your head--
Do you think, at your age, it is right?'
'In my youth,' Father William replied to his son,
I feared it might injure the brain;
But, now that I'm perfectly sure I have none,
Why, I do it again and again.'
'You are old,' said the youth, 'as I mentioned before,
And have grown most uncommonly fat;
Yet you turned a back-somersault in at the door--
Pray, what is the reason of that?'
'In my youth,' said the sage, as he shook his grey locks,
'I kept all my limbs very supple
By the use of this ointment-- one shilling the box--
Allow me to sell you a couple?'
'You are old,' said the youth, 'and your jaws are too weak
For anything tougher than suet;
Yet you finished the goose, with the bones and the beak--
Pray how did you manage to do it?'
'In my youth,' said his father, 'I took to the law,
And argued each case with my wife;
And the muscular strength, which it gave to my jaw,
Has lasted the rest of my life.'
'You are old,' said the youth, 'one would hardly suppose
That your eye was as steady as ever;
Yet you balanced an eel on the end of your nose--
What made you so awfully clever?'
'I have answered three questions, and that is enough,'
Said his father; 'don't give yourself airs!
Do you think I can listen all day to such stuff?
Be off, or I'll kick you down stairs!'
'That is not said right,' said the Caterpillar.
'Not QUlTE right, I'm afraid,' said Alice, timidly; 'some of the words have got altered.'
'It is wrong from beginning to end,' said the Caterpillar decidedly, and there was silence for some minutes.
The Caterpillar was the first to speak.
'What size do you want to be?' it asked.
'Oh, I'm not particular as to size,' Alice hastily replied; 'only one doesn't like changing so often, you know.' 'I DON'T know,' said the Caterpillar.
Alice said nothing: she had never been so much contradicted in her life before, and she felt that she was losing her temper.
'Are you content now?' said the
Caterpillar.
'Well, I should like to be a LlTTLE larger, sir, if you wouldn't mind,' said Alice: 'three inches is such a wretched height to be.'
'It is a very good height indeed!' said the Caterpillar angrily, rearing itself upright as it spoke (it was exactly three inches high).
'But I'm not used to it!' pleaded poor Alice in a piteous tone.
And she thought of herself, 'I wish the creatures wouldn't be so easily offended!'
'You'll get used to it in time,' said the Caterpillar; and it put the hookah into its mouth and began smoking again.
This time Alice waited patiently until it chose to speak again.
In a minute or two the Caterpillar took the hookah out of its mouth and yawned once or twice, and shook itself.
Then it got down off the mushroom, and crawled away in the grass, merely remarking as it went, 'One side will make you grow taller, and the other side will make you grow shorter.'
The other side of WHAT?' thought Alice to herself.
'Of the mushroom,' said the Caterpillar, just as if she had asked it aloud; and in another moment it was out of sight.
Alice remained looking thoughtfully at the mushroom for a minute, trying to make out which were the two sides of it; and as it was perfectly round, she found this a very difficult question.
However, at last she stretched her arms round it as far as they would go, and broke off a bit of the edge with each hand.
'And now which is which?' she said to herself, and nibbled a little of the right- hand bit to try the effect: the next moment she felt a violent blow underneath her chin: it had struck her foot!
She was a good deal frightened by this very sudden change, but she felt that there was no time to be lost, as she was shrinking rapidly; so she set to work at once to eat some of the other bit.
Her chin was pressed so closely against her foot, that there was hardly room to open her mouth; but she did it at last, and managed to swallow a morsel of the lefthand bit.
'Come, my head's free at last!' said Alice in a tone of delight, which changed into alarm in another moment, when she found that her shoulders were nowhere to be found: all she could see, when she looked down, was an immense length of neck, which seemed to rise like a stalk out of a sea of green leaves that lay far below her.
'What CAN all that green stuff be?' said
And oh, my poor hands, how is it I can't see you?'
'And where HAVE my shoulders got to?
She was moving them about as she spoke, but no result seemed to follow, except a little shaking among the distant green leaves.
As there seemed to be no chance of getting her hands up to her head, she tried to get her head down to them, and was delighted to find that her neck would bend about easily in any direction, like a serpent.
She had just succeeded in curving it down into a graceful zigzag, and was going to dive in among the leaves, which she found to be nothing but the tops of the trees under which she had been wandering, when a sharp hiss made her draw back in a hurry: a large pigeon had flown into her face, and was beating her violently with its wings.
'Serpent!' screamed the Pigeon.
'I'm NOT a serpent!' said Alice indignantly.
'Let me alone!'
'Serpent, I say again!' repeated the Pigeon, but in a more subdued tone, and added with a kind of sob, 'I've tried every way, and nothing seems to suit them!'
'I haven't the least idea what you're talking about,' said Alice.
'I've tried the roots of trees, and I've tried banks, and I've tried hedges,' the
Pigeon went on, without attending to her; 'but those serpents!
There's no pleasing them!'
Alice was more and more puzzled, but she thought there was no use in saying anything more till the Pigeon had finished.
'As if it wasn't trouble enough hatching the eggs,' said the Pigeon; 'but I must be on the look-out for serpents night and day!
Why, I haven't had a wink of sleep these three weeks!'
'I'm very sorry you've been annoyed,' said Alice, who was beginning to see its meaning.
'And just as I'd taken the highest tree in the wood,' continued the Pigeon, raising its voice to a shriek, 'and just as I was thinking I should be free of them at last, they must needs come wriggling down from the sky!
Ugh, Serpent!' 'But I'm NOT a serpent, I tell you!' said
Alice.
'I'm a--I'm a--' 'Well!
WHAT are you?' said the Pigeon.
'I can see you're trying to invent something!'
'I--I'm a little girl,' said Alice, rather doubtfully, as she remembered the number of changes she had gone through that day.
'A likely story indeed!' said the Pigeon in a tone of the deepest contempt.
'I've seen a good many little girls in my time, but never ONE with such a neck as that!
No, no!
You're a serpent; and there's no use denying it.
I suppose you'll be telling me next that you never tasted an egg!'
'I HAVE tasted eggs, certainly,' said Alice, who was a very truthful child; 'but little girls eat eggs quite as much as serpents do, you know.'
'I don't believe it,' said the Pigeon; 'but if they do, why then they're a kind of serpent, that's all I can say.'
This was such a new idea to Alice, that she was quite silent for a minute or two, which gave the Pigeon the opportunity of adding, 'You're looking for eggs, I know THAT well enough; and what does it matter to me whether you're a little girl or a serpent?'
'It matters a good deal to ME,' said Alice hastily; 'but I'm not looking for eggs, as it happens; and if I was, I shouldn't want YOURS:
I don't like them raw.' 'Well, be off, then!' said the Pigeon in a sulky tone, as it settled down again into its nest.
Alice crouched down among the trees as well as she could, for her neck kept getting entangled among the branches, and every now and then she had to stop and untwist it.
After a while she remembered that she still held the pieces of mushroom in her hands, and she set to work very carefully, nibbling first at one and then at the other, and growing sometimes taller and sometimes shorter, until she had succeeded in bringing herself down to her usual height.
It was so long since she had been anything near the right size, that it felt quite strange at first; but she got used to it in a few minutes, and began talking to herself, as usual.
'Come, there's half my plan done now!
How puzzling all these changes are!
I'm never sure what I'm going to be, from one minute to another!
However, I've got back to my right size: the next thing is, to get into that beautiful garden--how IS that to be done, I wonder?'
As she said this, she came suddenly upon an open place, with a little house in it about four feet high.
'Whoever lives there,' thought Alice, 'it'll never do to come upon them THlS size: why, I should frighten them out of their wits!'
So she began nibbling at the righthand bit again, and did not venture to go near the house till she had brought herself down to nine inches high. &gt;
Chapter Vl.
Pig and Pepper
For a minute or two she stood looking at the house, and wondering what to do next, when suddenly a footman in livery came running out of the wood--(she considered him to be a footman because he was in livery: otherwise, judging by his face only, she would have called him a fish)-- and rapped loudly at the door with his knuckles.
It was opened by another footman in livery, with a round face, and large eyes like a frog; and both footmen, Alice noticed, had powdered hair that curled all over their heads.
She felt very curious to know what it was all about, and crept a little way out of the wood to listen.
The Fish-Footman began by producing from under his arm a great letter, nearly as large as himself, and this he handed over to the other, saying, in a solemn tone,
'For the Duchess.
An invitation from the Queen to play croquet.'
The Frog-Footman repeated, in the same solemn tone, only changing the order of the words a little, 'From the Queen.
An invitation for the Duchess to play croquet.'
Then they both bowed low, and their curls got entangled together.
Alice laughed so much at this, that she had to run back into the wood for fear of their hearing her; and when she next peeped out the Fish-Footman was gone, and the other was sitting on the ground near the door, staring stupidly up into the sky.
Alice went timidly up to the door, and knocked.
'There's no sort of use in knocking,' said the Footman, 'and that for two reasons.
First, because I'm on the same side of the door as you are; secondly, because they're making such a noise inside, no one could possibly hear you.'
And certainly there was a most extraordinary noise going on within--a constant howling and sneezing, and every now and then a great crash, as if a dish or kettle had been broken to pieces.
'Please, then,' said Alice, 'how am I to get in?'
'There might be some sense in your knocking,' the Footman went on without attending to her, 'if we had the door between us.
For instance, if you were INSlDE, you might knock, and I could let you out, you know.'
He was looking up into the sky all the time he was speaking, and this Alice thought decidedly uncivil.
'But perhaps he can't help it,' she said to herself; 'his eyes are so VERY nearly at the top of his head.
But at any rate he might answer questions. --How am I to get in?' she repeated, aloud.
'I shall sit here,' the Footman remarked, 'till tomorrow--'
At this moment the door of the house opened, and a large plate came skimming out, straight at the Footman's head: it just grazed his nose, and broke to pieces against one of the trees behind him. '--or next day, maybe,' the Footman continued in the same tone, exactly as if nothing had happened.
'How am I to get in?' asked Alice again, in a louder tone.
'ARE you to get in at all?' said the Footman.
'That's the first question, you know.' It was, no doubt: only Alice did not like to be told so.
'It's really dreadful,' she muttered to herself, 'the way all the creatures argue.
It's enough to drive one crazy!'
The Footman seemed to think this a good opportunity for repeating his remark, with variations.
'I shall sit here,' he said, 'on and off, for days and days.'
'But what am I to do?' said Alice.
'Anything you like,' said the Footman, and began whistling.
'Oh, there's no use in talking to him,' said Alice desperately: 'he's perfectly idiotic!'
And she opened the door and went in.
The door led right into a large kitchen, which was full of smoke from one end to the other: the Duchess was sitting on a three- legged stool in the middle, nursing a baby; the cook was leaning over the fire, stirring a large cauldron which seemed to be full of soup.
'There's certainly too much pepper in that soup!'
Alice said to herself, as well as she could for sneezing.
There was certainly too much of it in the air.
Even the Duchess sneezed occasionally; and as for the baby, it was sneezing and howling alternately without a moment's pause.
The only things in the kitchen that did not sneeze, were the cook, and a large cat which was sitting on the hearth and grinning from ear to ear.
'Please would you tell me,' said Alice, a little timidly, for she was not quite sure whether it was good manners for her to speak first, 'why your cat grins like that?'
'It's a Cheshire cat,' said the Duchess, 'and that's why.
Pig!'
She said the last word with such sudden violence that Alice quite jumped; but she saw in another moment that it was addressed to the baby, and not to her, so she took courage, and went on again:--
'I didn't know that Cheshire cats always grinned; in fact, I didn't know that cats
'They all can,' said the Duchess; 'and most of 'em do.'
'I don't know of any that do,' Alice said very politely, feeling quite pleased to have got into a conversation.
'You don't know much,' said the Duchess;
'and that's a fact.'
Alice did not at all like the tone of this remark, and thought it would be as well to introduce some other subject of conversation.
While she was trying to fix on one, the cook took the cauldron of soup off the fire, and at once set to work throwing everything within her reach at the Duchess and the baby--the fire-irons came first; then followed a shower of saucepans, plates, and dishes.
The Duchess took no notice of them even when they hit her; and the baby was howling so much already, that it was quite impossible to say whether the blows hurt it or not.
'Oh, PLEASE mind what you're doing!' cried Alice, jumping up and down in an agony of terror.
'Oh, there goes his PREClOUS nose'; as an unusually large saucepan flew close by it, and very nearly carried it off.
'If everybody minded their own business,' the Duchess said in a hoarse growl, 'the world would go round a deal faster than it does.'
'Which would NOT be an advantage,' said Alice, who felt very glad to get an opportunity of showing off a little of her knowledge.
'Just think of what work it would make with the day and night!
You see the earth takes twenty-four hours to turn round on its axis--'
'Talking of axes,' said the Duchess, 'chop off her head!'
Alice glanced rather anxiously at the cook, to see if she meant to take the hint; but the cook was busily stirring the soup, and seemed not to be listening, so she went on again:
'Twenty-four hours, I THlNK; or is it twelve?
I--' 'Oh, don't bother ME,' said the Duchess; 'I never could abide figures!'
And with that she began nursing her child again, singing a sort of lullaby to it as she did so, and giving it a violent shake at the end of every line:
'Speak roughly to your little boy, And beat him when he sneezes:
He only does it to annoy, Because he knows it teases.'
CHORUS.
(In which the cook and the baby joined):
'Wow! wow! wow!'
While the Duchess sang the second verse of the song, she kept tossing the baby violently up and down, and the poor little thing howled so, that Alice could hardly hear the words:--
'I speak severely to my boy, I beat him when he sneezes;
For he can thoroughly enjoy The pepper when he pleases!'
CHORUS.
'Wow! wow! wow!'
'Here! you may nurse it a bit, if you like!' the Duchess said to Alice, flinging the baby at her as she spoke.
'I must go and get ready to play croquet with the Queen,' and she hurried out of the room.
The cook threw a frying-pan after her as she went out, but it just missed her.
Alice caught the baby with some difficulty, as it was a queer-shaped little creature, and held out its arms and legs in all directions, 'just like a star-fish,' thought Alice.
The poor little thing was snorting like a steam-engine when she caught it, and kept doubling itself up and straightening itself out again, so that altogether, for the first minute or two, it was as much as she could do to hold it.
As soon as she had made out the proper way of nursing it, (which was to twist it up into a sort of knot, and then keep tight hold of its right ear and left foot, so as to prevent its undoing itself,) she carried it out into the open air.
'IF I don't take this child away with me,' thought Alice, 'they're sure to kill it in a day or two: wouldn't it be murder to leave it behind?'
She said the last words out loud, and the little thing grunted in reply (it had left off sneezing by this time).
'Don't grunt,' said Alice; 'that's not at all a proper way of expressing yourself.'
The baby grunted again, and Alice looked very anxiously into its face to see what was the matter with it.
There could be no doubt that it had a VERY turn-up nose, much more like a snout than a real nose; also its eyes were getting extremely small for a baby: altogether
Alice did not like the look of the thing at all.
'But perhaps it was only sobbing,' she thought, and looked into its eyes again, to see if there were any tears.
No, there were no tears.
'If you're going to turn into a pig, my dear,' said Alice, seriously, 'I'll have nothing more to do with you.
Mind now!'
The poor little thing sobbed again (or grunted, it was impossible to say which), and they went on for some while in silence.
Alice was just beginning to think to herself, 'Now, what am I to do with this creature when I get it home?' when it grunted again, so violently, that she looked down into its face in some alarm.
This time there could be NO mistake about it: it was neither more nor less than a pig, and she felt that it would be quite absurd for her to carry it further.
So she set the little creature down, and felt quite relieved to see it trot away quietly into the wood.
'If it had grown up,' she said to herself, 'it would have made a dreadfully ugly child: but it makes rather a handsome pig, I think.'
And she began thinking over other children she knew, who might do very well as pigs, and was just saying to herself, 'if one only knew the right way to change them--' when she was a little startled by seeing the Cheshire Cat sitting on a bough of a tree a few yards off.
The Cat only grinned when it saw Alice.
It looked good-natured, she thought: still it had VERY long claws and a great many teeth, so she felt that it ought to be treated with respect.
'Cheshire Puss,' she began, rather timidly, as she did not at all know whether it would like the name: however, it only grinned a little wider.
'Come, it's pleased so far,' thought Alice, and she went on.
'Would you tell me, please, which way I ought to go from here?'
'That depends a good deal on where you want to get to,' said the Cat.
'I don't much care where--' said Alice.
'Then it doesn't matter which way you go,' said the Cat. '--so long as I get SOMEWHERE,' Alice added as an explanation.
'Oh, you're sure to do that,' said the Cat, 'if you only walk long enough.'
Alice felt that this could not be denied, so she tried another question.
'What sort of people live about here?'
'In THAT direction,' the Cat said, waving its right paw round, 'lives a Hatter: and in THAT direction,' waving the other paw, 'lives a March Hare.
Visit either you like: they're both mad.'
'But I don't want to go among mad people,' Alice remarked.
'Oh, you can't help that,' said the Cat: 'we're all mad here.
I'm mad.
You're mad.' 'How do you know I'm mad?' said Alice.
'You must be,' said the Cat, 'or you wouldn't have come here.'
Alice didn't think that proved it at all; however, she went on 'And how do you know that you're mad?' 'To begin with,' said the Cat, 'a dog's not mad.
You grant that?' 'I suppose so,' said Alice.
'Well, then,' the Cat went on, 'you see, a dog growls when it's angry, and wags its tail when it's pleased.
Now I growl when I'm pleased, and wag my tail when I'm angry.
Therefore I'm mad.'
'I call it purring, not growling,' said
Alice.
'Call it what you like,' said the Cat.
'Do you play croquet with the Queen to- day?' 'I should like it very much,' said Alice,
'but I haven't been invited yet.'
'You'll see me there,' said the Cat, and vanished.
Alice was not much surprised at this, she was getting so used to queer things happening.
While she was looking at the place where it had been, it suddenly appeared again.
'By-the-bye, what became of the baby?' said the Cat.
'I'd nearly forgotten to ask.'
'It turned into a pig,' Alice quietly said, just as if it had come back in a natural way.
'I thought it would,' said the Cat, and vanished again.
Alice waited a little, half expecting to see it again, but it did not appear, and after a minute or two she walked on in the direction in which the March Hare was said to live.
'I've seen hatters before,' she said to herself; 'the March Hare will be much the most interesting, and perhaps as this is May it won't be raving mad--at least not so mad as it was in March.'
As she said this, she looked up, and there was the Cat again, sitting on a branch of a tree.
'Did you say pig, or fig?' said the Cat.
'I said pig,' replied Alice; 'and I wish you wouldn't keep appearing and vanishing so suddenly: you make one quite giddy.'
'All right,' said the Cat; and this time it vanished quite slowly, beginning with the end of the tail, and ending with the grin, which remained some time after the rest of it had gone.
It's the most curious thing I ever saw in my life!'
She had not gone much farther before she came in sight of the house of the March
Hare: she thought it must be the right house, because the chimneys were shaped like ears and the roof was thatched with fur.
It was so large a house, that she did not like to go nearer till she had nibbled some more of the lefthand bit of mushroom, and raised herself to about two feet high: even then she walked up towards it rather timidly, saying to herself 'Suppose it should be raving mad after all!
I almost wish I'd gone to see the Hatter instead!' &gt;
Chapter VIl.
A Mad Tea-Party
There was a table set out under a tree in front of the house, and the March Hare and the Hatter were having tea at it: a Dormouse was sitting between them, fast asleep, and the other two were using it as a cushion, resting their elbows on it, and talking over its head.
'Very uncomfortable for the Dormouse,' thought Alice; 'only, as it's asleep, I suppose it doesn't mind.'
The table was a large one, but the three were all crowded together at one corner of it:
'No room!
No room!' they cried out when they saw
Alice coming.
'There's PLENTY of room!' said Alice indignantly, and she sat down in a large arm-chair at one end of the table.
'Have some wine,' the March Hare said in an encouraging tone.
Alice looked all round the table, but there was nothing on it but tea.
'I don't see any wine,' she remarked.
'There isn't any,' said the March Hare.
'Then it wasn't very civil of you to offer it,' said Alice angrily.
'It wasn't very civil of you to sit down without being invited,' said the March
Hare.
'I didn't know it was YOUR table,' said Alice; 'it's laid for a great many more than three.' 'Your hair wants cutting,' said the Hatter.
He had been looking at Alice for some time with great curiosity, and this was his first speech.
'You should learn not to make personal remarks,' Alice said with some severity;
'it's very rude.'
The Hatter opened his eyes very wide on hearing this; but all he SAlD was, 'Why is a raven like a writing-desk?' 'Come, we shall have some fun now!' thought
Alice.
'I'm glad they've begun asking riddles. --I believe I can guess that,' she added aloud.
'Do you mean that you think you can find out the answer to it?' said the March Hare.
'Exactly so,' said Alice.
'Then you should say what you mean,' the
March Hare went on.
'I do,' Alice hastily replied; 'at least-- at least I mean what I say--that's the same thing, you know.' 'Not the same thing a bit!' said the
Hatter.
'You might just as well say that "I see what I eat" is the same thing as "I eat what I see"!'
'You might just as well say,' added the March Hare, 'that "I like what I get" is the same thing as "I get what I like"!'
'You might just as well say,' added the Dormouse, who seemed to be talking in his sleep, 'that "I breathe when I sleep" is the same thing as "I sleep when I breathe"!'
'It IS the same thing with you,' said the Hatter, and here the conversation dropped, and the party sat silent for a minute, while Alice thought over all she could remember about ravens and writing-desks, which wasn't much.
The Hatter was the first to break the silence.
'What day of the month is it?' he said, turning to Alice: he had taken his watch out of his pocket, and was looking at it uneasily, shaking it every now and then, and holding it to his ear.
Alice considered a little, and then said 'The fourth.'
'Two days wrong!' sighed the Hatter.
'I told you butter wouldn't suit the works!' he added looking angrily at the
'It was the BEST butter,' the March Hare meekly replied.
'Yes, but some crumbs must have got in as well,' the Hatter grumbled: 'you shouldn't have put it in with the bread-knife.'
The March Hare took the watch and looked at it gloomily: then he dipped it into his cup of tea, and looked at it again: but he could think of nothing better to say than his first remark, 'It was the BEST butter, you know.'
Alice had been looking over his shoulder with some curiosity.
'What a funny watch!' she remarked.
'It tells the day of the month, and doesn't tell what o'clock it is!'
'Why should it?' muttered the Hatter.
'Does YOUR watch tell you what year it is?'
'Of course not,' Alice replied very readily: 'but that's because it stays the same year for such a long time together.' 'Which is just the case with MlNE,' said the Hatter.
Alice felt dreadfully puzzled.
The Hatter's remark seemed to have no sort of meaning in it, and yet it was certainly English.
'I don't quite understand you,' she said, as politely as she could.
'The Dormouse is asleep again,' said the Hatter, and he poured a little hot tea upon its nose.
The Dormouse shook its head impatiently, and said, without opening its eyes, 'Of course, of course; just what I was going to remark myself.'
'Have you guessed the riddle yet?' the Hatter said, turning to Alice again.
'No, I give it up,' Alice replied: 'what's the answer?'
'I haven't the slightest idea,' said the Hatter.
'Nor I,' said the March Hare.
Alice sighed wearily.
'I think you might do something better with the time,' she said, 'than waste it in asking riddles that have no answers.'
'If you knew Time as well as I do,' said the Hatter, 'you wouldn't talk about wasting IT.
It's HlM.'
'I don't know what you mean,' said Alice.
'Of course you don't!' the Hatter said, tossing his head contemptuously.
'I dare say you never even spoke to Time!'
'Perhaps not,' Alice cautiously replied: 'but I know I have to beat time when I
learn music.' 'Ah! that accounts for it,' said the
Hatter.
'He won't stand beating.
Now, if you only kept on good terms with him, he'd do almost anything you liked with the clock.
For instance, suppose it were nine o'clock in the morning, just time to begin lessons: you'd only have to whisper a hint to Time, and round goes the clock in a twinkling!
Half-past one, time for dinner!' ('I only wish it was,' the March Hare said to itself in a whisper.)
'That would be grand, certainly,' said Alice thoughtfully: 'but then--I shouldn't be hungry for it, you know.'
'Not at first, perhaps,' said the Hatter: 'but you could keep it to half-past one as long as you liked.' 'Is that the way YOU manage?'
Alice asked.
The Hatter shook his head mournfully.
'Not I!' he replied.
'We quarrelled last March--just before HE went mad, you know--' (pointing with his tea spoon at the March Hare,) '--it was at the great concert given by the Queen of
Hearts, and I had to sing
"Twinkle, twinkle, little bat!
How I wonder what you're at!"
You know the song, perhaps?' 'I've heard something like it,' said Alice.
'It goes on, you know,' the Hatter continued, 'in this way:--
"Up above the world you fly, Like a tea-tray in the sky.
Twinkle, twinkle--"'
Here the Dormouse shook itself, and began singing in its sleep 'Twinkle, twinkle, twinkle, twinkle--' and went on so long that they had to pinch it to make it stop.
'Well, I'd hardly finished the first verse,' said the Hatter, 'when the Queen jumped up and bawled out, "He's murdering the time!
Off with his head!"'
'How dreadfully savage!' exclaimed Alice.
'And ever since that,' the Hatter went on in a mournful tone, 'he won't do a thing I ask!
It's always six o'clock now.'
A bright idea came into Alice's head.
'Is that the reason so many tea-things are put out here?' she asked.
'Yes, that's it,' said the Hatter with a sigh: 'it's always tea-time, and we've no time to wash the things between whiles.'
'Then you keep moving round, I suppose?' said Alice.
'Exactly so,' said the Hatter: 'as the things get used up.'
'But what happens when you come to the beginning again?'
Alice ventured to ask.
'Suppose we change the subject,' the March Hare interrupted, yawning.
'I'm getting tired of this.
I vote the young lady tells us a story.'
'I'm afraid I don't know one,' said Alice, rather alarmed at the proposal.
'Then the Dormouse shall!' they both cried.
'Wake up, Dormouse!'
And they pinched it on both sides at once.
The Dormouse slowly opened his eyes.
'I wasn't asleep,' he said in a hoarse, feeble voice:
'I heard every word you fellows were saying.'
'Tell us a story!' said the March Hare.
'Yes, please do!' pleaded Alice.
'And be quick about it,' added the Hatter,
'or you'll be asleep again before it's done.'
'Once upon a time there were three little sisters,' the Dormouse began in a great hurry; 'and their names were Elsie, Lacie, and Tillie; and they lived at the bottom of a well--'
'What did they live on?' said Alice, who always took a great interest in questions of eating and drinking.
'So they were,' said the Dormouse; 'VERY ill.'
'They couldn't have done that, you know,' Alice gently remarked; 'they'd have been ill.' Alice tried to fancy to herself what such an extraordinary ways of living would be
like, but it puzzled her too much, so she went on:
'But why did they live at the bottom of a well?'
'Take some more tea,' the March Hare said to Alice, very earnestly.
'I've had nothing yet,' Alice replied in an offended tone, 'so I can't take more.'
'You mean you can't take LESS,' said the Hatter: 'it's very easy to take MORE than nothing.' 'Nobody asked YOUR opinion,' said Alice.
'Who's making personal remarks now?' the Hatter asked triumphantly.
Alice did not quite know what to say to this: so she helped herself to some tea and bread-and-butter, and then turned to the Dormouse, and repeated her question.
'Why did they live at the bottom of a well?'
The Dormouse again took a minute or two to think about it, and then said, 'It was a treacle-well.'
'There's no such thing!'
Alice was beginning very angrily, but the Hatter and the March Hare went 'Sh! sh!' and the Dormouse sulkily remarked, 'If you can't be civil, you'd better finish the story for yourself.'
Alice said very humbly; 'I won't interrupt again.
'One, indeed!' said the Dormouse indignantly.
However, he consented to go on.
'And so these three little sisters--they were learning to draw, you know--'
'What did they draw?' said Alice, quite forgetting her promise.
'Treacle,' said the Dormouse, without considering at all this time.
'I want a clean cup,' interrupted the Hatter: 'let's all move one place on.'
He moved on as he spoke, and the Dormouse followed him: the March Hare moved into the
Dormouse's place, and Alice rather unwillingly took the place of the March
Hare.
The Hatter was the only one who got any advantage from the change: and Alice was a good deal worse off than before, as the March Hare had just upset the milk-jug into his plate.
Alice did not wish to offend the Dormouse again, so she began very cautiously:
'But I don't understand.
Where did they draw the treacle from?'
'You can draw water out of a water-well,' said the Hatter; 'so I should think you could draw treacle out of a treacle-well-- eh, stupid?'
'But they were IN the well,' Alice said to the Dormouse, not choosing to notice this last remark.
'Of course they were', said the Dormouse;
'--well in.'
This answer so confused poor Alice, that she let the Dormouse go on for some time without interrupting it.
'They were learning to draw,' the Dormouse went on, yawning and rubbing its eyes, for it was getting very sleepy; 'and they drew all manner of things--everything that begins with an M--'
'Why with an M?' said Alice.
'Why not?' said the March Hare.
Alice was silent.
The Dormouse had closed its eyes by this time, and was going off into a doze; but, on being pinched by the Hatter, it woke up again with a little shriek, and went on: '-
-that begins with an M, such as mouse- traps, and the moon, and memory, and muchness--you know you say things are "much of a muchness"--did you ever see such a thing as a drawing of a muchness?'
'Really, now you ask me,' said Alice, very much confused, 'I don't think--'
'Then you shouldn't talk,' said the Hatter.
This piece of rudeness was more than Alice could bear: she got up in great disgust, and walked off; the Dormouse fell asleep instantly, and neither of the others took the least notice of her going, though she
looked back once or twice, half hoping that they would call after her: the last time she saw them, they were trying to put the Dormouse into the teapot.
'At any rate I'll never go THERE again!' said Alice as she picked her way through the wood.
'It's the stupidest tea-party I ever was at in all my life!'
Just as she said this, she noticed that one of the trees had a door leading right into it.
'That's very curious!' she thought.
'But everything's curious today.
I think I may as well go in at once.'
And in she went.
Once more she found herself in the long hall, and close to the little glass table.
'Now, I'll manage better this time,' she said to herself, and began by taking the little golden key, and unlocking the door that led into the garden.
Then she went to work nibbling at the mushroom (she had kept a piece of it in her pocket) till she was about a foot high: then she walked down the little passage: and THEN--she found herself at last in the beautiful garden, among the bright flower- beds and the cool fountains. &gt;
Chapter Vill.
The Queen's Croquet-Ground A large rose-tree stood near the entrance of the garden: the roses growing on it were white, but there were three gardeners at it, busily painting them red.
Alice thought this a very curious thing, and she went nearer to watch them, and just as she came up to them she heard one of them say, 'Look out now, Five!
Don't go splashing paint over me like that!'
'I couldn't help it,' said Five, in a sulky tone; 'Seven jogged my elbow.'
On which Seven looked up and said, 'That's right, Five!
Always lay the blame on others!' 'YOU'D better not talk!' said Five.
'I heard the Queen say only yesterday you deserved to be beheaded!'
'What for?' said the one who had spoken first.
'That's none of YOUR business, Two!' said Seven. 'Yes, it IS his business!' said Five, 'and I'll tell him--it was for bringing the cook tulip-roots instead of onions.'
Seven flung down his brush, and had just begun 'Well, of all the unjust things--' when his eye chanced to fall upon Alice, as she stood watching them, and he checked himself suddenly: the others looked round also, and all of them bowed low.
'Would you tell me,' said Alice, a little timidly, 'why you are painting those roses?'
Five and Seven said nothing, but looked at Two.
Two began in a low voice, 'Why the fact is, you see, Miss, this here ought to have been a RED rose-tree, and we put a white one in by mistake; and if the Queen was to find it out, we should all have our heads cut off, you know.
So you see, Miss, we're doing our best, afore she comes, to--' At this moment Five, who had been anxiously looking across the garden, called out 'The Queen!
The Queen!' and the three gardeners instantly threw themselves flat upon their faces.
Alice looked round, eager to see the Queen.
First came ten soldiers carrying clubs; these were all shaped like the three gardeners, oblong and flat, with their hands and feet at the corners: next the ten courtiers; these were ornamented all over with diamonds, and walked two and two, as the soldiers did.
After these came the royal children; there were ten of them, and the little dears came jumping merrily along hand in hand, in couples: they were all ornamented with hearts.
Next came the guests, mostly Kings and Queens, and among them Alice recognised the
White Rabbit: it was talking in a hurried nervous manner, smiling at everything that was said, and went by without noticing her.
Then followed the Knave of Hearts, carrying the King's crown on a crimson velvet cushion; and, last of all this grand procession, came THE KlNG AND QUEEN OF
HEARTS.
Alice was rather doubtful whether she ought not to lie down on her face like the three gardeners, but she could not remember ever having heard of such a rule at processions;
'and besides, what would be the use of a procession,' thought she, 'if people had all to lie down upon their faces, so that they couldn't see it?'
So she stood still where she was, and waited.
When the procession came opposite to Alice, they all stopped and looked at her, and the
Queen said severely 'Who is this?' She said it to the Knave of Hearts, who only bowed and smiled in reply.
'Idiot!' said the Queen, tossing her head impatiently; and, turning to Alice, she went on, 'What's your name, child?'
'My name is Alice, so please your Majesty,' said Alice very politely; but she added, to herself, 'Why, they're only a pack of cards, after all.
I needn't be afraid of them!'
'And who are THESE?' said the Queen, pointing to the three gardeners who were lying round the rosetree; for, you see, as they were lying on their faces, and the pattern on their backs was the same as the rest of the pack, she could not tell whether they were gardeners, or soldiers, or courtiers, or three of her own children.
'How should I know?' said Alice, surprised at her own courage.
'It's no business of MlNE.' The Queen turned crimson with fury, and, after glaring at her for a moment like a wild beast, screamed 'Off with her head!
Off--'
'Nonsense!' said Alice, very loudly and decidedly, and the Queen was silent.
The King laid his hand upon her arm, and timidly said 'Consider, my dear: she is only a child!'
The Queen turned angrily away from him, and said to the Knave 'Turn them over!'
The Knave did so, very carefully, with one foot.
'Get up!' said the Queen, in a shrill, loud voice, and the three gardeners instantly jumped up, and began bowing to the King, the Queen, the royal children, and everybody else.
'Leave off that!' screamed the Queen.
'You make me giddy.'
And then, turning to the rose-tree, she went on, 'What HAVE you been doing here?'
'May it please your Majesty,' said Two, in a very humble tone, going down on one knee as he spoke, 'we were trying--' 'I see!' said the Queen, who had meanwhile been examining the roses.
'Off with their heads!' and the procession moved on, three of the soldiers remaining behind to execute the unfortunate gardeners, who ran to Alice for protection.
'You shan't be beheaded!' said Alice, and she put them into a large flower-pot that stood near.
The three soldiers wandered about for a minute or two, looking for them, and then quietly marched off after the others.
'Are their heads off?' shouted the Queen.
'Their heads are gone, if it please your Majesty!' the soldiers shouted in reply.
'That's right!' shouted the Queen.
'Can you play croquet?'
The soldiers were silent, and looked at Alice, as the question was evidently meant for her.
'Yes!' shouted Alice.
'Come on, then!' roared the Queen, and Alice joined the procession, wondering very much what would happen next.
'It's--it's a very fine day!' said a timid voice at her side.
She was walking by the White Rabbit, who was peeping anxiously into her face.
'Very,' said Alice: '--where's the Duchess?'
'Hush!
Hush!' said the Rabbit in a low, hurried tone.
He looked anxiously over his shoulder as he spoke, and then raised himself upon tiptoe, put his mouth close to her ear, and whispered 'She's under sentence of execution.'
'What for?' said Alice.
'Did you say "What a pity!" ?' the Rabbit asked.
'No, I didn't,' said Alice: 'I don't think it's at all a pity.
I said "What for?"' 'She boxed the Queen's ears--' the Rabbit began.
Alice gave a little scream of laughter.
'Oh, hush!' the Rabbit whispered in a frightened tone.
'The Queen will hear you!
You see, she came rather late, and the
Queen said--'
'Get to your places!' shouted the Queen in a voice of thunder, and people began running about in all directions, tumbling up against each other; however, they got settled down in a minute or two, and the game began.
Alice thought she had never seen such a curious croquet-ground in her life; it was all ridges and furrows; the balls were live hedgehogs, the mallets live flamingoes, and the soldiers had to double themselves up and to stand on their hands and feet, to make the arches.
The chief difficulty Alice found at first was in managing her flamingo: she succeeded in getting its body tucked away, comfortably enough, under her arm, with its legs hanging down, but generally, just as she had got its neck nicely straightened out, and was going to give the hedgehog a blow with its head, it WOULD twist itself round and look up in her face, with such a puzzled expression that she could not help bursting out laughing: and when she had got its head down, and was going to begin again, it was very provoking to find that the hedgehog had unrolled itself, and was in the act of crawling away: besides all this, there was generally a ridge or furrow in the way wherever she wanted to send the hedgehog to, and, as the doubled-up soldiers were always getting up and walking off to other parts of the ground, Alice soon came to the conclusion that it was a very difficult game indeed.
The players all played at once without waiting for turns, quarrelling all the while, and fighting for the hedgehogs; and in a very short time the Queen was in a furious passion, and went stamping about, and shouting 'Off with his head!' or 'Off with her head!' about once in a minute.
Alice began to feel very uneasy: to be sure, she had not as yet had any dispute with the Queen, but she knew that it might happen any minute, 'and then,' thought she,
'what would become of me?
They're dreadfully fond of beheading people here; the great wonder is, that there's any one left alive!'
She was looking about for some way of escape, and wondering whether she could get away without being seen, when she noticed a curious appearance in the air: it puzzled her very much at first, but, after watching it a minute or two, she made it out to be a grin, and she said to herself 'It's the
Cheshire Cat: now I shall have somebody to talk to.'
'How are you getting on?' said the Cat, as soon as there was mouth enough for it to speak with.
Alice waited till the eyes appeared, and then nodded.
'It's no use speaking to it,' she thought, 'till its ears have come, or at least one of them.'
In another minute the whole head appeared, and then Alice put down her flamingo, and began an account of the game, feeling very glad she had someone to listen to her.
The Cat seemed to think that there was enough of it now in sight, and no more of it appeared.
'I don't think they play at all fairly,' Alice began, in rather a complaining tone,
'and they all quarrel so dreadfully one can't hear oneself speak--and they don't seem to have any rules in particular; at least, if there are, nobody attends to them--and you've no idea how confusing it is all the things being alive; for instance, there's the arch I've got to go through next walking about at the other end of the ground--and I should have croqueted the Queen's hedgehog just now, only it ran away when it saw mine coming!'
'How do you like the Queen?' said the Cat in a low voice.
'Not at all,' said Alice: 'she's so extremely--' Just then she noticed that the
Queen was close behind her, listening: so she went on, '--likely to win, that it's hardly worth while finishing the game.'
The Queen smiled and passed on.
'Who ARE you talking to?' said the King, going up to Alice, and looking at the Cat's head with great curiosity.
'It's a friend of mine--a Cheshire Cat,' said Alice: 'allow me to introduce it.'
'I don't like the look of it at all,' said the King: 'however, it may kiss my hand if it likes.'
'I'd rather not,' the Cat remarked.
'Don't be impertinent,' said the King, 'and don't look at me like that!' He got behind Alice as he spoke.
'A cat may look at a king,' said Alice.
'I've read that in some book, but I don't remember where.'
'Well, it must be removed,' said the King very decidedly, and he called the Queen, who was passing at the moment, 'My dear!
I wish you would have this cat removed!'
The Queen had only one way of settling all difficulties, great or small. 'Off with his head!' she said, without even looking round.
'I'll fetch the executioner myself,' said the King eagerly, and he hurried off.
Alice thought she might as well go back, and see how the game was going on, as she heard the Queen's voice in the distance, screaming with passion.
She had already heard her sentence three of the players to be executed for having missed their turns, and she did not like the look of things at all, as the game was in such confusion that she never knew whether it was her turn or not.
So she went in search of her hedgehog.
The hedgehog was engaged in a fight with another hedgehog, which seemed to Alice an excellent opportunity for croqueting one of them with the other: the only difficulty was, that her flamingo was gone across to the other side of the garden, where Alice could see it trying in a helpless sort of way to fly up into a tree.
By the time she had caught the flamingo and brought it back, the fight was over, and both the hedgehogs were out of sight: 'but it doesn't matter much,' thought Alice, 'as all the arches are gone from this side of the ground.'
So she tucked it away under her arm, that it might not escape again, and went back for a little more conversation with her friend.
When she got back to the Cheshire Cat, she was surprised to find quite a large crowd collected round it: there was a dispute going on between the executioner, the King, and the Queen, who were all talking at once, while all the rest were quite silent, and looked very uncomfortable.
The moment Alice appeared, she was appealed to by all three to settle the question, and they repeated their arguments to her, though, as they all spoke at once, she found it very hard indeed to make out exactly what they said.
The executioner's argument was, that you couldn't cut off a head unless there was a body to cut it off from: that he had never had to do such a thing before, and he wasn't going to begin at HlS time of life.
The King's argument was, that anything that had a head could be beheaded, and that you weren't to talk nonsense.
The Queen's argument was, that if something wasn't done about it in less than no time she'd have everybody executed, all round.
(It was this last remark that had made the whole party look so grave and anxious.)
Alice could think of nothing else to say but 'It belongs to the Duchess: you'd better ask HER about it.' 'She's in prison,' the Queen said to the executioner: 'fetch her here.'
And the executioner went off like an arrow.
The Cat's head began fading away the moment he was gone, and, by the time he had come back with the Duchess, it had entirely disappeared; so the King and the executioner ran wildly up and down looking for it, while the rest of the party went back to the game. &gt;
Chapter IX.
The Mock Turtle's Story
'You can't think how glad I am to see you again, you dear old thing!' said the
Duchess, as she tucked her arm affectionately into Alice's, and they walked off together.
Alice was very glad to find her in such a pleasant temper, and thought to herself that perhaps it was only the pepper that had made her so savage when they met in the kitchen.
'When I'M a Duchess,' she said to herself, (not in a very hopeful tone though), 'I won't have any pepper in my kitchen AT ALL.
Soup does very well without--Maybe it's always pepper that makes people hot- tempered,' she went on, very much pleased at having found out a new kind of rule,
'and vinegar that makes them sour--and camomile that makes them bitter--and--and barley-sugar and such things that make children sweet-tempered.
I only wish people knew that: then they wouldn't be so stingy about it, you know--'
She had quite forgotten the Duchess by this time, and was a little startled when she heard her voice close to her ear.
'You're thinking about something, my dear, and that makes you forget to talk.
I can't tell you just now what the moral of that is, but I shall remember it in a bit.'
'Perhaps it hasn't one,' Alice ventured to remark.
'Tut, tut, child!' said the Duchess.
'Everything's got a moral, if only you can find it.'
And she squeezed herself up closer to Alice's side as she spoke.
Alice did not much like keeping so close to her: first, because the Duchess was VERY ugly; and secondly, because she was exactly the right height to rest her chin upon
Alice's shoulder, and it was an uncomfortably sharp chin.
However, she did not like to be rude, so she bore it as well as she could.
'The game's going on rather better now,' she said, by way of keeping up the conversation a little. " Tis so,' said the Duchess: 'and the moral of that is--"Oh, 'tis love, 'tis love, that makes the world go round!"'
'Somebody said,' Alice whispered, 'that it's done by everybody minding their own business!' 'Ah, well!
It means much the same thing,' said the Duchess, digging her sharp little chin into
Alice's shoulder as she added, 'and the moral of THAT is--"Take care of the sense, and the sounds will take care of themselves."'
'How fond she is of finding morals in things!'
Alice thought to herself.
'I dare say you're wondering why I don't put my arm round your waist,' the Duchess said after a pause: 'the reason is, that I'm doubtful about the temper of your flamingo.
Shall I try the experiment?' 'HE might bite,' Alice cautiously replied, not feeling at all anxious to have the experiment tried.
'Very true,' said the Duchess: 'flamingoes and mustard both bite.
And the moral of that is--"Birds of a feather flock together."'
'Only mustard isn't a bird,' Alice remarked.
'Right, as usual,' said the Duchess: 'what a clear way you have of putting things!'
'It's a mineral, I THlNK,' said Alice.
'Of course it is,' said the Duchess, who seemed ready to agree to everything that
Alice said; 'there's a large mustard-mine near here.
And the moral of that is--"The more there is of mine, the less there is of yours."'
'Oh, I know!' exclaimed Alice, who had not attended to this last remark, 'it's a vegetable.
It doesn't look like one, but it is.'
'I quite agree with you,' said the Duchess; 'and the moral of that is--"Be what you would seem to be"--or if you'd like it put more simply--"Never imagine yourself not to be otherwise than what it might appear to others that what you were or might have been was not otherwise than what you had been would have appeared to them to be otherwise."'
'I think I should understand that better,' Alice said very politely, 'if I had it written down: but I can't quite follow it as you say it.'
'That's nothing to what I could say if I chose,' the Duchess replied, in a pleased tone.
'Pray don't trouble yourself to say it any longer than that,' said Alice.
'Oh, don't talk about trouble!' said the Duchess.
'I make you a present of everything I've said as yet.'
'A cheap sort of present!' thought Alice.
'I'm glad they don't give birthday presents like that!'
But she did not venture to say it out loud.
'Thinking again?' the Duchess asked, with another dig of her sharp little chin.
'I've a right to think,' said Alice sharply, for she was beginning to feel a little worried.
'Just about as much right,' said the
Duchess, 'as pigs have to fly; and the m--'
But here, to Alice's great surprise, the Duchess's voice died away, even in the middle of her favourite word 'moral,' and the arm that was linked into hers began to tremble.
Alice looked up, and there stood the Queen in front of them, with her arms folded, frowning like a thunderstorm.
'A fine day, your Majesty!' the Duchess began in a low, weak voice.
'Now, I give you fair warning,' shouted the Queen, stamping on the ground as she spoke;
'either you or your head must be off, and that in about half no time!
Take your choice!'
The Duchess took her choice, and was gone in a moment.
'Let's go on with the game,' the Queen said to Alice; and Alice was too much frightened to say a word, but slowly followed her back to the croquet-ground.
The other guests had taken advantage of the Queen's absence, and were resting in the shade: however, the moment they saw her, they hurried back to the game, the Queen merely remarking that a moment's delay would cost them their lives.
All the time they were playing the Queen never left off quarrelling with the other players, and shouting 'Off with his head!' or 'Off with her head!'
Those whom she sentenced were taken into custody by the soldiers, who of course had to leave off being arches to do this, so that by the end of half an hour or so there were no arches left, and all the players, except the King, the Queen, and Alice, were in custody and under sentence of execution.
Then the Queen left off, quite out of breath, and said to Alice, 'Have you seen the Mock Turtle yet?'
'No,' said Alice.
'I don't even know what a Mock Turtle is.'
'It's the thing Mock Turtle Soup is made from,' said the Queen.
'I never saw one, or heard of one,' said Alice.
'Come on, then,' said the Queen, 'and he shall tell you his history,'
As they walked off together, Alice heard the King say in a low voice, to the company generally, 'You are all pardoned.'
'Come, THAT'S a good thing!' she said to herself, for she had felt quite unhappy at the number of executions the Queen had ordered.
They very soon came upon a Gryphon, lying fast asleep in the sun.
(IF you don't know what a Gryphon is, look at the picture.)
'Up, lazy thing!' said the Queen, 'and take this young lady to see the Mock Turtle, and to hear his history.
I must go back and see after some executions I have ordered'; and she walked off, leaving Alice alone with the Gryphon.
Alice did not quite like the look of the creature, but on the whole she thought it would be quite as safe to stay with it as to go after that savage Queen: so she waited.
The Gryphon sat up and rubbed its eyes: then it watched the Queen till she was out of sight: then it chuckled.
'What fun!' said the Gryphon, half to itself, half to Alice.
'What IS the fun?' said Alice.
'Why, SHE,' said the Gryphon.
'It's all her fancy, that: they never executes nobody, you know.
Come on!'
'Everybody says "come on!" here,' thought Alice, as she went slowly after it: 'I never was so ordered about in all my life, never!'
They had not gone far before they saw the Mock Turtle in the distance, sitting sad and lonely on a little ledge of rock, and, as they came nearer, Alice could hear him sighing as if his heart would break.
She pitied him deeply.
'What is his sorrow?' she asked the Gryphon, and the Gryphon answered, very nearly in the same words as before, 'It's all his fancy, that: he hasn't got no sorrow, you know.
Come on!'
So they went up to the Mock Turtle, who looked at them with large eyes full of tears, but said nothing.
'This here young lady,' said the Gryphon, 'she wants for to know your history, she do.'
'I'll tell it her,' said the Mock Turtle in a deep, hollow tone: 'sit down, both of you, and don't speak a word till I've finished.'
So they sat down, and nobody spoke for some minutes.
Alice thought to herself, 'I don't see how he can EVEN finish, if he doesn't begin.'
But she waited patiently.
'Once,' said the Mock Turtle at last, with a deep sigh, 'I was a real Turtle.'
These words were followed by a very long silence, broken only by an occasional exclamation of 'Hjckrrh!' from the Gryphon, and the constant heavy sobbing of the Mock
Turtle.
Alice was very nearly getting up and saying, 'Thank you, sir, for your interesting story,' but she could not help thinking there MUST be more to come, so she sat still and said nothing.
'When we were little,' the Mock Turtle went on at last, more calmly, though still sobbing a little now and then, 'we went to school in the sea.
The master was an old Turtle--we used to call him Tortoise--'
'Why did you call him Tortoise, if he wasn't one?'
Alice asked.
'We called him Tortoise because he taught us,' said the Mock Turtle angrily: 'really you are very dull!'
'You ought to be ashamed of yourself for asking such a simple question,' added the
Gryphon; and then they both sat silent and looked at poor Alice, who felt ready to sink into the earth.
At last the Gryphon said to the Mock Turtle, 'Drive on, old fellow!
Don't be all day about it!' and he went on in these words:
'Yes, we went to school in the sea, though you mayn't believe it--'
'I never said I didn't!' interrupted Alice.
'You did,' said the Mock Turtle.
'Hold your tongue!' added the Gryphon, before Alice could speak again.
The Mock Turtle went on.
'We had the best of educations--in fact, we went to school every day--'
'I'VE been to a day-school, too,' said Alice; 'you needn't be so proud as all that.'
'With extras?' asked the Mock Turtle a little anxiously.
'Yes,' said Alice, 'we learned French and music.'
'And washing?' said the Mock Turtle.
'Certainly not!' said Alice indignantly.
'Ah! then yours wasn't a really good school,' said the Mock Turtle in a tone of great relief.
'Now at OURS they had at the end of the bill, "French, music, AND WASHlNG--extra."'
'You couldn't have wanted it much,' said Alice; 'living at the bottom of the sea.'
'I couldn't afford to learn it.' said the Mock Turtle with a sigh.
'I only took the regular course.'
'What was that?' inquired Alice.
'Reeling and Writhing, of course, to begin with,' the Mock Turtle replied; 'and then the different branches of Arithmetic-- Ambition, Distraction, Uglification, and
Derision.'
'I never heard of "Uglification,"' Alice ventured to say.
The Gryphon lifted up both its paws in surprise.
'What!
Never heard of uglifying!' it exclaimed.
'Well, then,' the Gryphon went on, 'if you don't know what to uglify is, you ARE a simpleton.'
Alice did not feel encouraged to ask any more questions about it, so she turned to the Mock Turtle, and said 'What else had you to learn?'
'Well, there was Mystery,' the Mock Turtle replied, counting off the subjects on his flappers, '--Mystery, ancient and modern, with Seaography: then Drawling--the
Drawling-master was an old conger-eel, that used to come once a week: HE taught us Drawling, Stretching, and Fainting in
Coils.' 'What was THAT like?' said Alice.
'Well, I can't show it you myself,' the Mock Turtle said: 'I'm too stiff.
And the Gryphon never learnt it.' 'Hadn't time,' said the Gryphon: 'I went to the Classics master, though.
He was an old crab, HE was.' 'I never went to him,' the Mock Turtle said with a sigh: 'he taught Laughing and Grief, they used to say.'
'So he did, so he did,' said the Gryphon, sighing in his turn; and both creatures hid their faces in their paws.
'And how many hours a day did you do lessons?' said Alice, in a hurry to change the subject.
'Ten hours the first day,' said the Mock
Turtle: 'nine the next, and so on.'
'What a curious plan!' exclaimed Alice.
'That's the reason they're called lessons,' the Gryphon remarked: 'because they lessen from day to day.'
This was quite a new idea to Alice, and she thought it over a little before she made her next remark.
'Then the eleventh day must have been a holiday?'
'Of course it was,' said the Mock Turtle.
'And how did you manage on the twelfth?'
Alice went on eagerly.
'That's enough about lessons,' the Gryphon interrupted in a very decided tone: 'tell her something about the games now.' &gt;
Chapter X. The Lobster Quadrille The Mock Turtle sighed deeply, and drew the back of one flapper across his eyes.
'Same as if he had a bone in his throat,' said the Gryphon: and it set to work shaking him and punching him in the back.
At last the Mock Turtle recovered his voice, and, with tears running down his cheeks, he went on again:--
'You may not have lived much under the sea- -' ('I haven't,' said Alice)--'and perhaps you were never even introduced to a lobster--' (Alice began to say 'I once tasted--' but checked herself hastily, and said 'No, never') '--so you can have no idea what a delightful thing a Lobster
Quadrille is!' 'No, indeed,' said Alice.
'What sort of a dance is it?'
'Why,' said the Gryphon, 'you first form into a line along the sea-shore--'
'Two lines!' cried the Mock Turtle.
'Seals, turtles, salmon, and so on; then, when you've cleared all the jelly-fish out of the way--' 'THAT generally takes some time,' interrupted the Gryphon. '--you advance twice--' 'Each with a lobster as a partner!' cried the Gryphon.
'Of course,' the Mock Turtle said: 'advance twice, set to partners--'
'--change lobsters, and retire in same order,' continued the Gryphon.
'Then, you know,' the Mock Turtle went on, 'you throw the--'
'The lobsters!' shouted the Gryphon, with a bound into the air. '--as far out to sea as you can--' 'Swim after them!' screamed the Gryphon.
'Turn a somersault in the sea!' cried the Mock Turtle, capering wildly about.
'Change lobsters again!' yelled the Gryphon at the top of its voice.
'Back to land again, and that's all the first figure,' said the Mock Turtle, suddenly dropping his voice; and the two creatures, who had been jumping about like mad things all this time, sat down again very sadly and quietly, and looked at Alice.
'It must be a very pretty dance,' said Alice timidly.
'Would you like to see a little of it?' said the Mock Turtle.
'Very much indeed,' said Alice.
'Come, let's try the first figure!' said the Mock Turtle to the Gryphon.
'We can do without lobsters, you know.
Which shall sing?'
'Oh, YOU sing,' said the Gryphon.
'I've forgotten the words.'
So they began solemnly dancing round and round Alice, every now and then treading on her toes when they passed too close, and waving their forepaws to mark the time, while the Mock Turtle sang this, very slowly and sadly:--
'"Will you walk a little faster?" said a whiting to a snail.
"There's a porpoise close behind us, and he's treading on my tail.
See how eagerly the lobsters and the turtles all advance!
They are waiting on the shingle--will you come and join the dance?
Will you, won't you, will you, won't you, will you join the dance?
Will you, won't you, will you, won't you, won't you join the dance?
"You can really have no notion how delightful it will be When they take us up and throw us, with the lobsters, out to sea!"
But the snail replied "Too far, too far!" and gave a look askance-- Said he thanked the whiting kindly, but he would not join the dance.
Would not, could not, would not, could not, would not join the dance.
Would not, could not, would not, could not, could not join the dance.
'"What matters it how far we go?" his scaly friend replied.
"There is another shore, you know, upon the other side.
The further off from England the nearer is to France-- Then turn not pale, beloved snail, but come and join the dance.
Will you, won't you, will you, won't you, will you join the dance?
Will you, won't you, will you, won't you, won't you join the dance?"'
'Thank you, it's a very interesting dance to watch,' said Alice, feeling very glad that it was over at last: 'and I do so like that curious song about the whiting!'
'Oh, as to the whiting,' said the Mock Turtle, 'they--you've seen them, of course?' 'Yes,' said Alice, 'I've often seen them at dinn--' she checked herself hastily.
'I don't know where Dinn may be,' said the Mock Turtle, 'but if you've seen them so often, of course you know what they're like.'
'I believe so,' Alice replied thoughtfully.
'They have their tails in their mouths--and they're all over crumbs.'
'You're wrong about the crumbs,' said the Mock Turtle: 'crumbs would all wash off in the sea.
But they HAVE their tails in their mouths; and the reason is--' here the Mock Turtle yawned and shut his eyes.
--'Tell her about the reason and all that,' he said to the Gryphon.
'The reason is,' said the Gryphon, 'that they WOULD go with the lobsters to the dance.
So they got thrown out to sea.
So they had to fall a long way.
So they got their tails fast in their mouths.
So they couldn't get them out again.
That's all.'
'Thank you,' said Alice, 'it's very interesting.
I never knew so much about a whiting before.'
'I can tell you more than that, if you like,' said the Gryphon.
'Do you know why it's called a whiting?' 'I never thought about it,' said Alice.
'Why?'
'IT DOES THE BOOTS AND SHOES.' the Gryphon replied very solemnly.
Alice was thoroughly puzzled.
'Does the boots and shoes!' she repeated in a wondering tone.
'Why, what are YOUR shoes done with?' said the Gryphon.
'I mean, what makes them so shiny?'
Alice looked down at them, and considered a little before she gave her answer.
'They're done with blacking, I believe.' 'Boots and shoes under the sea,' the
Gryphon went on in a deep voice, 'are done with a whiting.
Now you know.'
'And what are they made of?' Alice asked in a tone of great curiosity.
'Soles and eels, of course,' the Gryphon replied rather impatiently: 'any shrimp could have told you that.'
'If I'd been the whiting,' said Alice, whose thoughts were still running on the song, 'I'd have said to the porpoise, "Keep back, please: we don't want YOU with us!"'
'They were obliged to have him with them,' the Mock Turtle said: 'no wise fish would go anywhere without a porpoise.' 'Wouldn't it really?' said Alice in a tone of great surprise.
'Of course not,' said the Mock Turtle: 'why, if a fish came to ME, and told me he was going a journey, I should say "With what porpoise?"'
'Don't you mean "purpose"?' said Alice.
'I mean what I say,' the Mock Turtle replied in an offended tone.
And the Gryphon added 'Come, let's hear some of YOUR adventures.'
'I could tell you my adventures--beginning from this morning,' said Alice a little timidly: 'but it's no use going back to yesterday, because I was a different person then.'
'Explain all that,' said the Mock Turtle.
'No, no!
The adventures first,' said the Gryphon in an impatient tone: 'explanations take such a dreadful time.'
So Alice began telling them her adventures from the time when she first saw the White
Rabbit.
She was a little nervous about it just at first, the two creatures got so close to her, one on each side, and opened their eyes and mouths so VERY wide, but she gained courage as she went on.
Her listeners were perfectly quiet till she got to the part about her repeating 'YOU
ARE OLD, FATHER WlLLlAM,' to the Caterpillar, and the words all coming different, and then the Mock Turtle drew a long breath, and said 'That's very curious.'
'It's all about as curious as it can be,' said the Gryphon.
'It all came different!' the Mock Turtle repeated thoughtfully.
'I should like to hear her try and repeat something now.
Tell her to begin.'
He looked at the Gryphon as if he thought it had some kind of authority over Alice.
'Stand up and repeat "'TlS THE VOlCE OF THE SLUGGARD,"' said the Gryphon.
'How the creatures order one about, and make one repeat lessons!' thought Alice; 'I might as well be at school at once.'
However, she got up, and began to repeat it, but her head was so full of the Lobster
Quadrille, that she hardly knew what she was saying, and the words came very queer indeed:--
" Tis the voice of the Lobster; I heard him declare,
"You have baked me too brown, I must sugar my hair."
As a duck with its eyelids, so he with his nose
Trims his belt and his buttons, and turns out his toes.'
[later editions continued as follows When the sands are all dry, he is gay as a lark, And will talk in contemptuous tones of the Shark,
But, when the tide rises and sharks are around,
His voice has a timid and tremulous sound.]
'That's different from what I used to say when I was a child,' said the Gryphon.
'Well, I never heard it before,' said the Mock Turtle; 'but it sounds uncommon nonsense.'
Alice said nothing; she had sat down with her face in her hands, wondering if anything would EVER happen in a natural way again.
'I should like to have it explained,' said the Mock Turtle.
'She can't explain it,' said the Gryphon hastily.
'Go on with the next verse.'
'But about his toes?' the Mock Turtle persisted.
'How COULD he turn them out with his nose, you know?'
'It's the first position in dancing.'
Alice said; but was dreadfully puzzled by the whole thing, and longed to change the subject.
'Go on with the next verse,' the Gryphon repeated impatiently: 'it begins "I passed by his garden."'
Alice did not dare to disobey, though she felt sure it would all come wrong, and she went on in a trembling voice:--
'I passed by his garden, and marked, with one eye,
How the Owl and the Panther were sharing a pie--'
[later editions continued as follows The Panther took pie-crust, and gravy, and meat, While the Owl had the dish as its share of the treat.
When the pie was all finished, the Owl, as a boon,
Was kindly permitted to pocket the spoon:
While the Panther received knife and fork with a growl,
And concluded the banquet--]
It's by far the most confusing thing I ever heard!'
'Yes, I think you'd better leave off,' said the Gryphon: and Alice was only too glad to do so.
'Shall we try another figure of the Lobster
Quadrille?' the Gryphon went on.
'Or would you like the Mock Turtle to sing you a song?'
'Oh, a song, please, if the Mock Turtle would be so kind,' Alice replied, so eagerly that the Gryphon said, in a rather offended tone, 'Hm!
No accounting for tastes!
Sing her "Turtle Soup," will you, old fellow?'
The Mock Turtle sighed deeply, and began, in a voice sometimes choked with sobs, to sing this:--
'Beautiful Soup, so rich and green, Waiting in a hot tureen!

'Chorus again!' cried the Gryphon, and the Mock Turtle had just begun to repeat it, when a cry of 'The trial's beginning!' was heard in the distance.
'Come on!' cried the Gryphon, and, taking Alice by the hand, it hurried off, without waiting for the end of the song.
'What trial is it?'
Alice panted as she ran; but the Gryphon only answered 'Come on!' and ran the faster, while more and more faintly came, carried on the breeze that followed them, the melancholy words:--
'Soo--oop of the e--e--evening, Beautiful, beautiful Soup!' &gt;
Chapter Xl.
Who Stole the Tarts?
The King and Queen of Hearts were seated on their throne when they arrived, with a great crowd assembled about them--all sorts of little birds and beasts, as well as the whole pack of cards: the Knave was standing before them, in chains, with a soldier on each side to guard him; and near the King was the White Rabbit, with a trumpet in one hand, and a scroll of parchment in the other.
In the very middle of the court was a table, with a large dish of tarts upon it: they looked so good, that it made Alice quite hungry to look at them--'I wish they'd get the trial done,' she thought, 'and hand round the refreshments!'
But there seemed to be no chance of this, so she began looking at everything about her, to pass away the time.
Alice had never been in a court of justice before, but she had read about them in books, and she was quite pleased to find that she knew the name of nearly everything there.
'That's the judge,' she said to herself, 'because of his great wig.'
The judge, by the way, was the King; and as he wore his crown over the wig, (look at the frontispiece if you want to see how he did it,) he did not look at all comfortable, and it was certainly not becoming.
'And that's the jury-box,' thought Alice, 'and those twelve creatures,' (she was obliged to say 'creatures,' you see, because some of them were animals, and some were birds,) 'I suppose they are the jurors.'
She said this last word two or three times over to herself, being rather proud of it: for she thought, and rightly too, that very few little girls of her age knew the meaning of it at all.
However, 'jury-men' would have done just as well.
The twelve jurors were all writing very busily on slates.
'What are they doing?'
Alice whispered to the Gryphon. 'They can't have anything to put down yet, before the trial's begun.'
'They're putting down their names,' the Gryphon whispered in reply, 'for fear they should forget them before the end of the trial.'
'Stupid things!'
Alice began in a loud, indignant voice, but she stopped hastily, for the White Rabbit cried out, 'Silence in the court!' and the King put on his spectacles and looked anxiously round, to make out who was talking.
Alice could see, as well as if she were looking over their shoulders, that all the jurors were writing down 'stupid things!' on their slates, and she could even make out that one of them didn't know how to spell 'stupid,' and that he had to ask his neighbour to tell him.
'A nice muddle their slates'll be in before the trial's over!' thought Alice.
One of the jurors had a pencil that squeaked.
This of course, Alice could not stand, and she went round the court and got behind him, and very soon found an opportunity of taking it away.
She did it so quickly that the poor little juror (it was Bill, the Lizard) could not make out at all what had become of it; so, after hunting all about for it, he was obliged to write with one finger for the rest of the day; and this was of very little use, as it left no mark on the slate.
'Herald, read the accusation!' said the
On this the White Rabbit blew three blasts on the trumpet, and then unrolled the parchment scroll, and read as follows:--
'The Queen of Hearts, she made some tarts, All on a summer day:
The Knave of Hearts, he stole those tarts, And took them quite away!'
'Consider your verdict,' the King said to the jury.
'Not yet, not yet!' the Rabbit hastily interrupted.
'There's a great deal to come before that!'
'Call the first witness,' said the King; and the White Rabbit blew three blasts on the trumpet, and called out, 'First witness!'
The first witness was the Hatter.
He came in with a teacup in one hand and a piece of bread-and-butter in the other.
'I beg pardon, your Majesty,' he began, 'for bringing these in: but I hadn't quite finished my tea when I was sent for.'
'You ought to have finished,' said the King.
'When did you begin?'
'Fourteenth of March, I think it was,' he said.
'Fifteenth,' said the March Hare.
'Sixteenth,' added the Dormouse.
'Write that down,' the King said to the jury, and the jury eagerly wrote down all three dates on their slates, and then added them up, and reduced the answer to shillings and pence.
'Take off your hat,' the King said to the Hatter.
'It isn't mine,' said the Hatter.
'Stolen!' the King exclaimed, turning to the jury, who instantly made a memorandum of the fact.
'I keep them to sell,' the Hatter added as an explanation; 'I've none of my own.
I'm a hatter.'
Here the Queen put on her spectacles, and began staring at the Hatter, who turned pale and fidgeted.
'Give your evidence,' said the King; 'and don't be nervous, or I'll have you executed on the spot.'
This did not seem to encourage the witness at all: he kept shifting from one foot to the other, looking uneasily at the Queen, and in his confusion he bit a large piece out of his teacup instead of the bread-and- butter.
Just at this moment Alice felt a very curious sensation, which puzzled her a good deal until she made out what it was: she was beginning to grow larger again, and she thought at first she would get up and leave the court; but on second thoughts she decided to remain where she was as long as there was room for her.
'I wish you wouldn't squeeze so.' said the
Dormouse, who was sitting next to her.
'I can hardly breathe.' 'I can't help it,' said Alice very meekly:
'I'm growing.' 'You've no right to grow here,' said the
Dormouse.
'Don't talk nonsense,' said Alice more boldly: 'you know you're growing too.'
'Yes, but I grow at a reasonable pace,' said the Dormouse: 'not in that ridiculous fashion.'
And he got up very sulkily and crossed over to the other side of the court.
All this time the Queen had never left off staring at the Hatter, and, just as the
Dormouse crossed the court, she said to one of the officers of the court, 'Bring me the
list of the singers in the last concert!' on which the wretched Hatter trembled so, that he shook both his shoes off.
'Give your evidence,' the King repeated angrily, 'or I'll have you executed, whether you're nervous or not.'
'I'm a poor man, your Majesty,' the Hatter began, in a trembling voice, '--and I hadn't begun my tea--not above a week or so--and what with the bread-and-butter getting so thin--and the twinkling of the tea--'
'It began with the tea,' the Hatter replied.
'Of course twinkling begins with a T!' said the King sharply.
'Do you take me for a dunce?
Go on!'
'I'm a poor man,' the Hatter went on, 'and most things twinkled after that--only the
March Hare said--' 'I didn't!' the March Hare interrupted in a great hurry.
'You did!' said the Hatter.
'I deny it!' said the March Hare.
'He denies it,' said the King: 'leave out that part.'
'Well, at any rate, the Dormouse said--' the Hatter went on, looking anxiously round to see if he would deny it too: but the Dormouse denied nothing, being fast asleep.
'After that,' continued the Hatter, 'I cut some more bread-and-butter--'
'But what did the Dormouse say?' one of the jury asked.
'That I can't remember,' said the Hatter.
'You MUST remember,' remarked the King, 'or I'll have you executed.'
The miserable Hatter dropped his teacup and bread-and-butter, and went down on one knee.
'I'm a poor man, your Majesty,' he began.
'You're a very poor speaker,' said the
King.
Here one of the guinea-pigs cheered, and was immediately suppressed by the officers of the court.
(As that is rather a hard word, I will just explain to you how it was done.
They had a large canvas bag, which tied up at the mouth with strings: into this they slipped the guinea-pig, head first, and then sat upon it.)
'I'm glad I've seen that done,' thought Alice.
'I've so often read in the newspapers, at the end of trials, "There was some attempts at applause, which was immediately suppressed by the officers of the court," and I never understood what it meant till now.'
'If that's all you know about it, you may stand down,' continued the King.
'I can't go no lower,' said the Hatter: 'I'm on the floor, as it is.'
Here the other guinea-pig cheered, and was suppressed.
'Come, that finished the guinea-pigs!' thought Alice.
'Now we shall get on better.'
'I'd rather finish my tea,' said the Hatter, with an anxious look at the Queen, who was reading the list of singers.
'You may go,' said the King, and the Hatter hurriedly left the court, without even waiting to put his shoes on. '--and just take his head off outside,' the Queen added to one of the officers: but the
Hatter was out of sight before the officer could get to the door.
'Call the next witness!' said the King.
The next witness was the Duchess's cook.
She carried the pepper-box in her hand, and
Alice guessed who it was, even before she got into the court, by the way the people near the door began sneezing all at once.
'Give your evidence,' said the King.
'Shan't,' said the cook.
The King looked anxiously at the White Rabbit, who said in a low voice, 'Your
Majesty must cross-examine THlS witness.'
'Well, if I must, I must,' the King said, with a melancholy air, and, after folding his arms and frowning at the cook till his eyes were nearly out of sight, he said in a deep voice, 'What are tarts made of?'
'Pepper, mostly,' said the cook.
'Treacle,' said a sleepy voice behind her.
'Collar that Dormouse,' the Queen shrieked out.
'Behead that Dormouse!
Turn that Dormouse out of court!
Suppress him!
Pinch him!
Off with his whiskers!'
For some minutes the whole court was in confusion, getting the Dormouse turned out, and, by the time they had settled down again, the cook had disappeared.
'Never mind!' said the King, with an air of great relief.
'Call the next witness.'
And he added in an undertone to the Queen, 'Really, my dear, YOU must cross-examine the next witness.
It quite makes my forehead ache!'
Alice watched the White Rabbit as he fumbled over the list, feeling very curious to see what the next witness would be like, '--for they haven't got much evidence YET,' she said to herself.
Imagine her surprise, when the White Rabbit read out, at the top of his shrill little voice, the name 'Alice!' &gt;
Chapter XIl.
Alice's Evidence
'Here!' cried Alice, quite forgetting in the flurry of the moment how large she had grown in the last few minutes, and she jumped up in such a hurry that she tipped over the jury-box with the edge of her skirt, upsetting all the jurymen on to the heads of the crowd below, and there they
'Oh, I BEG your pardon!' she exclaimed in a tone of great dismay, and began picking them up again as quickly as she could, for the accident of the goldfish kept running in her head, and she had a vague sort of idea that they must be collected at once and put back into the jury-box, or they would die.
'The trial cannot proceed,' said the King in a very grave voice, 'until all the jurymen are back in their proper places-- ALL,' he repeated with great emphasis, looking hard at Alice as he said do.
Alice looked at the jury-box, and saw that, in her haste, she had put the Lizard in head downwards, and the poor little thing was waving its tail about in a melancholy way, being quite unable to move.
She soon got it out again, and put it right; 'not that it signifies much,' she said to herself; 'I should think it would be QUlTE as much use in the trial one way up as the other.'
As soon as the jury had a little recovered from the shock of being upset, and their slates and pencils had been found and handed back to them, they set to work very diligently to write out a history of the accident, all except the Lizard, who seemed too much overcome to do anything but sit with its mouth open, gazing up into the roof of the court.
'What do you know about this business?' the King said to Alice.
'Nothing,' said Alice.
'Nothing WHATEVER?' persisted the King.
'Nothing whatever,' said Alice.
'That's very important,' the King said, turning to the jury.
They were just beginning to write this down on their slates, when the White Rabbit interrupted: 'UNimportant, your Majesty means, of course,' he said in a very respectful tone, but frowning and making faces at him as he spoke.
'UNimportant, of course, I meant,' the King hastily said, and went on to himself in an undertone,
'important--unimportant--unimportant-- important--' as if he were trying which word sounded best.
Some of the jury wrote it down 'important,' and some 'unimportant.'
Alice could see this, as she was near enough to look over their slates; 'but it doesn't matter a bit,' she thought to herself.
At this moment the King, who had been for some time busily writing in his note-book, cackled out 'Silence!' and read out from his book, 'Rule Forty-two.
ALL PERSONS MORE THAN A MlLE HlGH TO LEAVE THE COURT.'
Everybody looked at Alice.
'I'M not a mile high,' said Alice.
'You are,' said the King.
'Nearly two miles high,' added the Queen.
'Well, I shan't go, at any rate,' said
Alice: 'besides, that's not a regular rule: you invented it just now.'
'It's the oldest rule in the book,' said the King.
'Then it ought to be Number One,' said Alice.
The King turned pale, and shut his note- book hastily.
'Consider your verdict,' he said to the jury, in a low, trembling voice.
'There's more evidence to come yet, please your Majesty,' said the White Rabbit, jumping up in a great hurry; 'this paper has just been picked up.'
'What's in it?' said the Queen.
'I haven't opened it yet,' said the White Rabbit, 'but it seems to be a letter, written by the prisoner to--to somebody.'
'It must have been that,' said the King, 'unless it was written to nobody, which isn't usual, you know.' 'Who is it directed to?' said one of the jurymen.
'It isn't directed at all,' said the White Rabbit; 'in fact, there's nothing written on the OUTSlDE.'
He unfolded the paper as he spoke, and added 'It isn't a letter, after all: it's a set of verses.'
'Are they in the prisoner's handwriting?' asked another of the jurymen.
'No, they're not,' said the White Rabbit, 'and that's the queerest thing about it.'
(The jury all looked puzzled.) 'He must have imitated somebody else's hand,' said the King.
(The jury all brightened up again.) 'Please your Majesty,' said the Knave, 'I didn't write it, and they can't prove I did: there's no name signed at the end.'
'If you didn't sign it,' said the King, 'that only makes the matter worse.
You MUST have meant some mischief, or else you'd have signed your name like an honest man.'
There was a general clapping of hands at this: it was the first really clever thing the King had said that day.
'That PROVES his guilt,' said the Queen.
'It proves nothing of the sort!' said Alice.
'Why, you don't even know what they're about!'
'Where shall I begin, please your Majesty?' he asked.
The White Rabbit put on his spectacles.
'Begin at the beginning,' the King said gravely, 'and go on till you come to the end: then stop.' These were the verses the White Rabbit read:--
'They told me you had been to her, And mentioned me to him:
She gave me a good character, But said I could not swim.
He sent them word I had not gone (We know it to be true):
If she should push the matter on, What would become of you?
I gave her one, they gave him two, You gave us three or more;
They all returned from him to you, Though they were mine before.
If I or she should chance to be Involved in this affair,
He trusts to you to set them free, Exactly as we were.
My notion was that you had been (Before she had this fit)
An obstacle that came between Him, and ourselves, and it.
Don't let him know she liked them best, For this must ever be
A secret, kept from all the rest, Between yourself and me.'
'That's the most important piece of evidence we've heard yet,' said the King, rubbing his hands; 'so now let the jury--'
'If any one of them can explain it,' said Alice, (she had grown so large in the last few minutes that she wasn't a bit afraid of interrupting him,) 'I'll give him sixpence.
I don't believe there's an atom of meaning in it.'
The jury all wrote down on their slates, 'SHE doesn't believe there's an atom of meaning in it,' but none of them attempted to explain the paper.
'If there's no meaning in it,' said the King, 'that saves a world of trouble, you know, as we needn't try to find any.
And yet I don't know,' he went on, spreading out the verses on his knee, and looking at them with one eye; 'I seem to see some meaning in them, after all. "--SAlD I COULD NOT SWlM--" you can't swim, can you?' he added, turning to the Knave.
The Knave shook his head sadly.
'Do I look like it?' he said.
(Which he certainly did NOT, being made entirely of cardboard.)
'All right, so far,' said the King, and he went on muttering over the verses to himself: '"WE KNOW IT TO BE TRUE--" that's the jury, of course--"I GAVE HER ONE, THEY
GAVE HlM TWO--" why, that must be what he did with the tarts, you know--'
'But, it goes on "THEY ALL RETURNED FROM HlM TO YOU,"' said Alice.
'Why, there they are!' said the King triumphantly, pointing to the tarts on the table.
'Nothing can be clearer than THAT.
Then again--"BEFORE SHE HAD THlS FlT--" you never had fits, my dear, I think?' he said to the Queen.
'Never!' said the Queen furiously, throwing an inkstand at the Lizard as she spoke.
(The unfortunate little Bill had left off writing on his slate with one finger, as he found it made no mark; but he now hastily began again, using the ink, that was trickling down his face, as long as it lasted.)
'Then the words don't FlT you,' said the King, looking round the court with a smile.
There was a dead silence.
'It's a pun!' the King added in an offended tone, and everybody laughed, 'Let the jury consider their verdict,' the King said, for about the twentieth time that day.
'No, no!' said the Queen.
'Sentence first--verdict afterwards.'
'Stuff and nonsense!' said Alice loudly.
'The idea of having the sentence first!'
'Hold your tongue!' said the Queen, turning purple.
'I won't!' said Alice.
'Off with her head!' the Queen shouted at the top of her voice.
Nobody moved.
'Who cares for you?' said Alice, (she had grown to her full size by this time.)
'You're nothing but a pack of cards!'
At this the whole pack rose up into the air, and came flying down upon her: she gave a little scream, half of fright and half of anger, and tried to beat them off, and found herself lying on the bank, with her head in the lap of her sister, who was gently brushing away some dead leaves that had fluttered down from the trees upon her face.
'Wake up, Alice dear!' said her sister; 'Why, what a long sleep you've had!'
'Oh, I've had such a curious dream!' said Alice, and she told her sister, as well as she could remember them, all these strange Adventures of hers that you have just been reading about; and when she had finished, her sister kissed her, and said, 'It WAS a curious dream, dear, certainly: but now run in to your tea; it's getting late.'
So Alice got up and ran off, thinking while she ran, as well she might, what a wonderful dream it had been.
But her sister sat still just as she left her, leaning her head on her hand, watching the setting sun, and thinking of little Alice and all her wonderful Adventures, till she too began dreaming after a fashion, and this was her dream:--
First, she dreamed of little Alice herself, and once again the tiny hands were clasped upon her knee, and the bright eager eyes were looking up into hers--she could hear the very tones of her voice, and see that queer little toss of her head to keep back the wandering hair that WOULD always get into her eyes--and still as she listened, or seemed to listen, the whole place around her became alive the strange creatures of her little sister's dream.
The long grass rustled at her feet as the White Rabbit hurried by--the frightened
Mouse splashed his way through the neighbouring pool--she could hear the rattle of the teacups as the March Hare and his friends shared their never-ending meal, and the shrill voice of the Queen ordering off her unfortunate guests to execution-- once more the pig-baby was sneezing on the
Duchess's knee, while plates and dishes crashed around it--once more the shriek of the Gryphon, the squeaking of the Lizard's slate-pencil, and the choking of the suppressed guinea-pigs, filled the air, mixed up with the distant sobs of the miserable Mock Turtle.
So she sat on, with closed eyes, and half believed herself in Wonderland, though she knew she had but to open them again, and all would change to dull reality--the grass would be only rustling in the wind, and the pool rippling to the waving of the reeds-- the rattling teacups would change to tinkling sheep-bells, and the Queen's shrill cries to the voice of the shepherd boy--and the sneeze of the baby, the shriek of the Gryphon, and all the other queer noises, would change (she knew) to the confused clamour of the busy farm-yard-- while the lowing of the cattle in the distance would take the place of the Mock Turtle's heavy sobs.
Lastly, she pictured to herself how this same little sister of hers would, in the after-time, be herself a grown woman; and how she would keep, through all her riper years, the simple and loving heart of her childhood: and how she would gather about her other little children, and make THElR eyes bright and eager with many a strange tale, perhaps even with the dream of
Wonderland of long ago: and how she would feel with all their simple sorrows, and find a pleasure in all their simple joys, remembering her own child-life, and the happy summer days.
THE END &gt;
My Aspirations...
My name is Syaiful Bahri
I am 21 years old
I live in Cianjur
I am now working as an administrative staff and also as a teacher
Have you worked abroad?
I was once offered
Not that I wanted it to, but someone offered me
But since I was already working here And studying in college too
So I turned down the offer
When, where and what kind of work?
It was 2009. The destination was Korea, to do drawing job
Because I was studying in a Vocational School majoring in drawing
So I was offered to go to Korea to do work in the same field as my major
What was the process to go to Korea?
There was training to learn Korean language
But I didn't stick too long, only around 1-2 days
Then I changed my mind
So I came back home
Do you still want to try your luck abroad?
Not really, I am not interested
After having a long thought about it, I decided I did not want to
Especially after hearing all the news about immigrants that was like...
Gosh, no, I don't want it.
Do you have any family member or friends working as migrant workers?
Only my third sister
Forced by economic situation
That is the first time in the family, my third sister works in Arabic countries
There are friends also, but not my peers
Mostly because of economic situation as well
Most of the men go to Korea
The women usually go to Arabic countries
Besides being migrant worker, what kind of job options available here?
If they don't go abroad, they usually go to Jakarta to work
Or work as farm workers here
Or stay here and do nothing
Because job opportunities are hard to find
There is no work here
At least we should go to the city of Cianjur and work in factories
Otherwise, the young men choose to go to Jakarta
How is the education level in here?
For now, thankfully, many have graduated Senior High School or Vocational School
Before, people only studied until Middle School
Nowadays, since there are colleges that offer distance learning program, more people are pursuing college degrees
What is your education and your aspiration?
I am in semester 5 majoring in Pancasila and Civic Education
I want to be a teacher. Hopefully I could.
I want to take few moments with you
Just...just be where you are, wherever this is
And just to do a little bit looking together again
I dont want to talk to you, so that you think
Actually this
Talking is not to produce thinking.
Is more recognition.
Something more energetic.
Or meditative....is not to scratch your head.
So just want you just to sit for a moment
Dont raise your hood
There is an awareness here
Even if there is........ a sort of shimmering
Of thought .....the energy of thought is present
There is no need to pay attention to that, just be aware of that.
But dont follow!
Stay only as That!
Awareness!
Which feels more like space.
You do also
This awareness is not trying to get to another point, or to any point.
Its not trying to clear things up
It has no intention
There is no need a feeling of presence.
Watch this feeling inside yourself!
Nobody put it there!
This taste , this taste of Presence....
Its not a person.........Its not an object
Even the settlest sensations are appearing in it.
You are not doing anything at all
Even listening is taking place spontaneously within yourself
Dont die yourself to the mind or to any image
Stay only as Aware!
If thoughts come,dont say they should not come.
Let them come!
And the same way they come, they will also go
But dont wait for their passing
Your Awareness, Self is like a space
Pure pure SPACE
In which all movements of consciousness of mind, names and forms are simply occuring by themselves
You are not coming or going
But comings and goings are occuring in you
And intelligence is taking care of them
You can not recognise yourself objectively
Because you are settler then any object
You are just a Space of awareness
You are Ageless
Unbound
There is nothing to do about what you are hearing
You are in a state of PURE recognition only
Any idea that you need to do something "to be that which is" ...is only an idea
But your belief in any idea, will give life to it
This you dont have to do, you are not compelled.
If there is some mental noise or some energetic noise, let it simply be there.
Dont judge!
It is not greater then you.
Nothing can overwhelm you.
Nothing Can Overwhelm you!
Nothing can extend beyond you.You are the space, which all things manifest, play
You are the awareness of them
You can never be a casualty......of what you perceived
No this deep inside your Being
You are not a process, but innumer proposes are flowing in you
Nothing can erase you or cover you up. These are just thoughts, but when believed in, they will bring to you taste that you may or may not like
The idea you have about who you are is not You.
You are beyond ideas.
For this reason you can perceive them
No feeling can contain you, for this reason you can perceive them you are aware of them
You are not a mood.
Even the most sophisticated, elevated,spiritual mood arises only within you as a phenomenon
You are the witness of it
How can you loose this understanding, this insight?
You are only being reminded of this
It can not be given to you, in the same way, it can not be taken from you
These are childish ideas
Okey
My big idea is a very, very small idea that can unlock billions of big ideas that are at the moment dormant inside us.
And my little idea that will do that is sleep.
(Laughter) (Applause)
This is a room of type-A women.
This is a room of sleep-deprived women.
And I learned the hard way, the value of sleep.
Two-and-a-half years ago, I fainted from exhaustion.
I hit my head on my desk.
I broke my cheekbone, I got five stitches on my right eye.
And I began the journey of rediscovering the value of sleep.
And in the course of that, I studied, I met with medical doctors, scientists, and I'm here to tell you that the way to a more productive, more inspired, more joyful life is getting enough sleep.
(Applause)
And we women are going to lead the way in this new revolution, this new feminist issue.
We are literally going to sleep our way to the top, literally.
(Laughter) (Applause)
Because unfortunately for men, sleep deprivation has become a virility symbol.
I was recently having dinner with a guy who bragged that he had only gotten four hours sleep the night before.
And I felt like saying to him -- but I didn't say it -- I felt like saying, "You know what?
If you had gotten five, this dinner would have been a lot more interesting."
(Laughter)
There is now a kind of sleep deprivation one-upmanship.
Especially here in Washington, if you try to make a breakfast date, and you say, "How about eight o'clock?" they're likely to tell you, "Eight o'clock is too late for me, but that's okay, I can get a game of tennis in and do a few conference calls and meet you at eight."
And they think that means that they are so incredibly busy and productive, but the truth is they're not, because we, at the moment, have had brilliant leaders in business, in finance, in politics, making terrible decisions.
So a high I.Q. does not mean that you're a good leader, because the essence of leadership is being able to see the iceberg before it hits the Titanic.
And we've had far too many icebergs hitting our Titanics.
In fact, I have a feeling that if Lehman Brothers was Lehman Brothers and Sisters, they might still be around.
(Applause)
While all the brothers were busy just being hyper-connected 24/7, maybe a sister would have noticed the iceberg, because she would have woken up from a seven-and-a-half- or eight-hour sleep and have been able to see the big picture.
So as we are facing all the multiple crises in our world at the moment, what is good for us on a personal level, what's going to bring more joy, gratitude, effectiveness in our lives and be the best for our own careers is also what is best for the world.
So I urge you to shut your eyes and discover the great ideas that lie inside us, to shut your engines and discover the power of sleep.
Thank you.
(Applause)
Hi.
I'm Kevin Allocca, I'm the trends manager at YouTube, and I professionally watch YouTube videos.
It's true.
So we're going to talk a little bit today about how videos go viral and then why that even matters.
We all want to be stars -- celebrities, singers, comedians -- and when I was younger, that seemed so very, very hard to do.
But now Web video has made it so that any of us or any of the creative things that we do can become completely famous in a part of our world's culture.
Any one of you could be famous on the Internet by next Saturday.
But there are over 48 hours of video uploaded to YouTube every minute.
And of that, only a tiny percentage ever goes viral and gets tons of views and becomes a cultural moment.
So how does it happen?
Three things: tastemakers, communities of participation and unexpectedness.
All right, let's go.
(Video) Bear Vasquez:
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God!
Wooo!
Ohhhhh, wowwww!
Last year, Bear Vasquez posted this video that he had shot outside his home in Yosemite National Park.
In 2010, it was viewed 23 million times.
(Laughter)
This is a chart of what it looked like when it first became popular last summer.
But he didn't actually set out to make a viral video, Bear.
He just wanted to share a rainbow.
Because that's what you do when your name is Yosemite Mountain Bear.
(Laughter)
And he had posted lots of nature videos in fact.
And this video had actually been posted all the way back in January.
So what happened here?
Jimmy Kimmel actually.
Jimmy Kimmel posted this tweet that would eventually propel the video to be as popular as it would become.
Because tastemakers like Jimmy Kimmel introduce us to new and interesting things and bring them to a larger audience.
(Video) Rebecca Black: ‚ô´ It's Friday, Friday.
Gotta get down on Friday. ‚ô´ ‚ô´ Everybody's looking forward to the weekend, weekend. ‚ô´ ‚ô´ Friday, Friday.
Gettin' down on Friday. ‚ô´
So you didn't think that we could actually have this conversation without talking about this video I hope.
Rebecca Black's "Friday" is one of the most popular videos of the year.
It's been seen nearly 200 million times this year.
This is a chart of what it looked like.
And similar to "Double Rainbow," it seems to have just sprouted up out of nowhere.
So what happened on this day?
Well it was a Friday, this is true.
And if you're wondering about those other spikes, those are also Fridays.
(Laughter)
But what about this day, this one particular Friday?
Well Tosh.0 picked it up, a lot of blogs starting writing about.
Michael J. Nelson from Mystery Science Theater was one of the first people to post a joke about the video on Twitter.
But what's important is that an individual or a group of tastemakers took a point of view and they shared that with a larger audience, accelerating the process.
And so then this community formed of people who shared this big inside joke and they started talking about it and doing things with it.
And now there are 10,000 parodies of "Friday" on YouTube.
Even in the first seven days, there was one parody for every other day of the week.
(Laughter)
Unlike the one-way entertainment of the 20th century, this community participation is how we become a part of the phenomenon -- either by spreading it or by doing something new with it.
(Music)
So "Nyan Cat" is a looped animation with looped music.
It's this, just like this.
It's been viewed nearly 50 million times this year.
And if you think that that is weird, you should know that there is a three-hour version of this that's been viewed four million times.
(Laughter)
Even cats were watching this video.
(Laughter)
Cats were watching other cats watch this video.
(Laughter)
But what's important here is the creativity that it inspired amongst this techie, geeky Internet culture.
There were remixes.
(Laughter)
Someone made an old timey version.
(Laughter)
And then it went international.
(Laughter)
An entire remix community sprouted up that brought it from being just a stupid joke to something that we can all actually be a part of.
Because we don't just enjoy now, we participate.
And who could have predicted any of this?
Who could have predicted "Double Rainbow" or Rebecca Black or "Nyan Cat?"
What scripts could you have written that would have contained this in it?
In a world where over two days of video get uploaded every minute, only that which is truly unique and unexpected can stand out in the way that these things have.
When a friend of mine told me that I needed to see this great video about a guy protesting bicycle fines in New York City, I admit I wasn't very interested.
(Video) Casey Niestat: So I got a ticket for not riding in the bike lane, but often there are obstructions that keep you from properly riding in the bike lane.
(Laughter)
KA: By being totally surprising and humorous, Casey Niestat got his funny idea and point seen five million times.
And so this approach holds for anything new that we do creatively.
And so it all brings us to one big question ... (Video) Bear Vasquez:
What does this mean?
Ohhhh.
(Laughter)
KA:
What does it mean?
Tastemakers, creative participating communities, complete unexpectedness, these are characteristics of a new kind of media and a new kind of culture where anyone has access and the audience defines the popularity.
I mean, as mentioned earlier, one of the biggest stars in the world right now, Justin Bieber, got his start on YouTube.
No one has to green-light your idea.
And we all now feel some ownership in our own pop culture.
And these are not characteristics of old media, and they're barely true of the media of today, but they will define the entertainment of the future.
Thank you.
(Applause)
I am a writer.
Writing books is my profession but it's more than that, of course.
It is also my great lifelong love and fascination.
And I don't expect that that's ever going to change.
But, that said, something kind of peculiar has happened recently in my life and in my career, which has caused me to have to recalibrate my whole relationship with this work.
And the peculiar thing is that I recently wrote this book, this memoir called "Eat, Pray, Love" which, decidedly unlike any of my previous books, went out in the world for some reason, and became this big, mega-sensation, international bestseller thing.
The result of which is that everywhere I go now, people treat me like I'm doomed. Seriously -- doomed, doomed!
Like, they come up to me now, all worried, and they say,
"Aren't you afraid you're never going to be able to top that?
Aren't you afraid you're going to keep writing for your whole life and you're never again going to create a book that anybody in the world cares about at all, ever again?"
So that's reassuring, you know.
But it would be worse, except for that I happen to remember that over 20 years ago, when I was a teenager, when I first started telling people that I wanted to be a writer,
I was met with this same sort of fear-based reaction.
And people would say, "Aren't you afraid you're never going to have any success?
Aren't you afraid the humiliation of rejection will kill you?
Aren't you afraid that you're going to work your whole life at this craft and nothing's ever going to come of it and you're going to die on a scrap heap of broken dreams with your mouth filled with bitter ash of failure?"
(Laughter)
Like that, you know.
The answer -- the short answer to all those questions is, "Yes."
Yes, I'm afraid of all those things.
And I always have been.
And I'm afraid of many, many more things besides that people can't even guess at,
like seaweed and other things that are scary.
But, when it comes to writing, the thing that I've been sort of thinking about lately, and wondering about lately, is why?
You know, is it rational? Is it logical that anybody should be expected to be afraid of the work that they feel they were put on this Earth to do.
And what is it specifically about creative ventures that seems to make us really nervous about each other's mental health in a way that other careers kind of don't do, you know?
Like my dad, for example, was a chemical engineer and I don't recall once in his 40 years of chemical engineering anybody asking him if he was afraid to be a chemical engineer, you know?
"That chemical-engineering block, John, how's it going?"
It just didn't come up like that, you know?
But to be fair, chemical engineers as a group haven't really earned a reputation over the centuries for being alcoholic manic-depressives.
(Laughter)
We writers, we kind of do have that reputation, and not just writers, but creative people across all genres, it seems, have this reputation for being enormously mentally unstable.
And all you have to do is look at the very grim death count in the 20th century alone, of really magnificent creative minds who died young and often at their own hands, you know?
And even the ones who didn't literally commit suicide seem to be really undone by their gifts, you know.
Norman Mailer, just before he died, last interview, he said,
"Every one of my books has killed me a little more."
An extraordinary statement to make about your life's work.
But we don't even blink when we hear somebody say this, because we've heard that kind of stuff for so long and somehow we've completely internalized and accepted collectively this notion that creativity and suffering are somehow inherently linked and that artistry, in the end, will always ultimately lead to anguish.
And the question that I want to ask everybody here today is are you guys all cool with that idea? Are you comfortable with that? Because you look at it even from an inch away and, you know --
I'm not at all comfortable with that assumption.
I think it's odious.
And I also think it's dangerous, and I don't want to see it perpetuated into the next century.
I think it's better if we encourage our great creative minds to live.
And I definitely know that, in my case -- in my situation -- it would be very dangerous for me to start sort of leaking down that dark path of assumption, particularly given the circumstance that I'm in right now in my career.
Which is -- you know, like check it out,
I'm pretty young, I'm only about 40 years old.
I still have maybe another four decades of work left in me.
And it's exceedingly likely that anything I write from this point forward is going to be judged by the world as the work that came after the freakish success of my last book, right?
I should just put it bluntly, because we're all sort of friends here now -- it's exceedingly likely that my greatest success is behind me.
So Jesus, what a thought!
That's the kind of thought that could lead a person to start drinking gin at nine o'clock in the morning, and I don't want to go there.
(Laughter)
I would prefer to keep doing this work that I love.
And so, the question becomes, how?
And so, it seems to me, upon a lot of reflection, that the way that I have to work now, in order to continue writing, is that I have to create some sort of protective psychological construct, right?
I have to sort of find some way to have a safe distance between me, as I am writing, and my very natural anxiety about what the reaction to that writing is going to be, from now on.
And, as I've been looking, over the last year, for models for how to do that, I've been sort of looking across time, and I've been trying to find other societies to see if they might have had better and saner ideas than we have about how to help creative people sort of manage the inherent emotional risks of creativity.
And that search has led me to ancient Greece and ancient Rome.
So stay with me, because it does circle around and back.
But, ancient Greece and ancient Rome -- people did not happen to believe that creativity came from human beings back then, OK?
People believed that creativity was this divine attendant spirit that came to human beings from some distant and unknowable source, for distant and unknowable reasons.
The Greeks famously called these divine attendant spirits of creativity "daemons."
Socrates, famously, believed that he had a daemon who spoke wisdom to him from afar.
The Romans had the same idea, but they called that sort of disembodied creative spirit a genius.
Which is great, because the Romans did not actually think that a genius was a particularly clever individual.
They believed that a genius was this, sort of magical divine entity, who was believed to literally live in the walls of an artist's studio, kind of like Dobby the house elf, and who would come out and sort of invisibly assist the artist with their work and would shape the outcome of that work.
So brilliant -- there it is, right there, that distance that I'm talking about -- that psychological construct to protect you from the results of your work.
And everyone knew that this is how it functioned, right?
So the ancient artist was protected from certain things, like, for example, too much narcissism, right?
If your work was brilliant, you couldn't take all the credit for it, everybody knew that you had this disembodied genius who had helped you.
If your work bombed, not entirely your fault, you know?
Everyone knew your genius was kind of lame.
(Laughter) And this is how people thought about creativity in the West for a really long time.
And then the Renaissance came and everything changed, and we had this big idea, and the big idea was, let's put the individual human being at the center of the universe above all gods and mysteries, and there's no more room for mystical creatures who take dictation from the divine.
And it's the beginning of rational humanism, and people started to believe that creativity came completely from the self of the individual.
And for the first time in history, you start to hear people referring to this or that artist as being a genius, rather than having a genius.
And I got to tell you, I think that was a huge error.
You know, I think that allowing somebody, one mere person to believe that he or she is like, the vessel, you know, like the font and the essence and the source of all divine, creative, unknowable, eternal mystery is just a smidge too much responsibility to put on one fragile, human psyche.
It's like asking somebody to swallow the sun.
It just completely warps and distorts egos, and it creates all these unmanageable expectations about performance.
And I think the pressure of that has been killing off our artists for the last 500 years.
And, if this is true, and I think it is true, the question becomes, what now?
Can we do this differently?
Maybe go back to some more ancient understanding about the relationship between humans and the creative mystery.
Maybe not.
Maybe we can't just erase 500 years of rational humanistic thought in one 18 minute speech.
And there's probably people in this audience who would raise really legitimate scientific suspicions about the notion of, basically, fairies who follow people around rubbing fairy juice on their projects and stuff.
I'm not, probably, going to bring you all along with me on this.
But the question that I kind of want to pose is -- you know, why not?
Why not think about it this way?
Because it makes as much sense as anything else I have ever heard in terms of explaining the utter maddening capriciousness of the creative process.
A process which, as anybody who has ever tried to make something -- which is to say basically everyone here --- knows does not always behave rationally.
And, in fact, can sometimes feel downright paranormal.
I had this encounter recently where I met the extraordinary American poet Ruth Stone, who's now in her 90s, but she's been a poet her entire life and she told me that when she was growing up in rural Virginia, she would be out working in the fields, and she said she would feel and hear a poem coming at her from over the landscape.
And she said it was like a thunderous train of air.
And it would come barreling down at her over the landscape.
And she felt it coming, because it would shake the earth under her feet.
She knew that she had only one thing to do at that point, and that was to, in her words, "run like hell."
And she would run like hell to the house and she would be getting chased by this poem, and the whole deal was that she had to get to a piece of paper and a pencil fast enough so that when it thundered through her, she could collect it and grab it on the page.
And other times she wouldn't be fast enough, so she'd be running and running, and she wouldn't get to the house and the poem would barrel through her and she would miss it and she said it would continue on across the landscape,
looking, as she put it "for another poet." And then there were these times -- this is the piece I never forgot -- she said that there were moments where she would almost miss it, right?
So, she's running to the house and she's looking for the paper and the poem passes through her, and she grabs a pencil just as it's going through her, and then she said, it was like she would reach out with her other hand and she would catch it.
She would catch the poem by its tail, and she would pull it backwards into her body as she was transcribing on the page.
And in these instances, the poem would come up on the page perfect and intact but backwards, from the last word to the first.
(Laughter)
So when I heard that I was like -- that's uncanny, that's exactly what my creative process is like.
(Laughter)
That's not at all what my creative process is -- I'm not the pipeline!
I'm a mule, and the way that I have to work is I have to get up at the same time every day, and sweat and labor and barrel through it really awkwardly.
But even I, in my mulishness, even I have brushed up against that thing, at times.
And I would imagine that a lot of you have too.
You know, even I have had work or ideas come through me from a source that I honestly cannot identify.
And what is that thing?
And how are we to relate to it in a way that will not make us lose our minds, but, in fact, might actually keep us sane?
And for me, the best contemporary example that I have of how to do that is the musician Tom Waits, who I got to interview several years ago on a magazine assignment.
And we were talking about this, and you know, Tom, for most of his life, he was pretty much the embodiment of the tormented contemporary modern artist, trying to control and manage and dominate these sort of uncontrollable creative impulses that were totally internalized.
But then he got older, he got calmer, and one day he was driving down the freeway in Los Angeles, and this is when it all changed for him.
And he's speeding along, and all of a sudden he hears this little fragment of melody, that comes into his head as inspiration often comes, elusive and tantalizing, and he wants it, it's gorgeous, and he longs for it, but he has no way to get it.
He doesn't have a piece of paper, or a pencil, or a tape recorder.
So he starts to feel all of that old anxiety start to rise in him like, "I'm going to lose this thing, and I'll be be haunted by this song forever.
I'm not good enough, and I can't do it."
And instead of panicking, he just stopped.
He just stopped that whole mental process and he did something completely novel.
He just looked up at the sky, and he said,
"Excuse me, can you not see that I'm driving?"
(Laughter)
"Do I look like I can write down a song right now?
If you really want to exist, come back at a more opportune moment when I can take care of you.
Otherwise, go bother somebody else today.
Go bother Leonard Cohen."
And his whole work process changed after that.
Not the work, the work was still oftentimes as dark as ever.
But the process, and the heavy anxiety around it was released when he took the genie, the genius out of him where it was causing nothing but trouble, and released it back where it came from, and realized that this didn't have to be this internalized, tormented thing.
It could be this peculiar, wondrous, bizarre collaboration, kind of conversation between Tom and the strange, external thing that was not quite Tom.
When I heard that story, it started to shift a little bit the way that I worked too, and this idea already saved me once.
It saved me when I was in the middle of writing "Eat, Pray, Love," and I fell into one of those sort of pits of despair that we all fall into when we're working on something and it's not coming and you start to think this is going to be a disaster, the worst book ever written.
Not just bad, but the worst book ever written.
And I started to think I should just dump this project.
But then I remembered Tom talking to the open air and I tried it.
So I just lifted my face up from the manuscript and I directed my comments to an empty corner of the room.
And I said aloud, "Listen you, thing, you and I both know that if this book isn't brilliant that is not entirely my fault, right?
Because you can see that I am putting everything I have into this,
I don't have any more than this.
If you want it to be better, you've got to show up and do your part of the deal.
But if you don't do that, you know what, the hell with it.
I'm going to keep writing anyway because that's my job.
And I would please like the record to reflect today that I showed up for my part of the job."
(Laughter)
Because -- (Applause) Because in the end it's like this, OK -- centuries ago in the deserts of North Africa, people used to gather for these moonlight dances of sacred dance and music that would go on for hours and hours, until dawn.
They were always magnificent, because the dancers were professionals and they were terrific, right?
But every once in a while, very rarely, something would happen, and one of these performers would actually become transcendent.
And I know you know what I'm talking about, because I know you've all seen, at some point in your life, a performance like this.
It was like time would stop, and the dancer would sort of step through some kind of portal and he wasn't doing anything different than he had ever done, 1,000 nights before, but everything would align.
And all of a sudden, he would no longer appear to be merely human.
He would be lit from within, and lit from below and all lit up on fire with divinity.
And when this happened, back then, people knew it for what it was, you know, they called it by its name.
They would put their hands together and they would start to chant,
"Allah, Allah, Allah, God, God, God."
That's God, you know.
Curious historical footnote: when the Moors invaded southern Spain, they took this custom with them and the pronunciation changed over the centuries from "Allah, Allah, Allah," to "Ol√©, ol√©, ol√©," which you still hear in bullfights and in flamenco dances.
In Spain, when a performer has done something impossible and magic,
"Allah, ol√©, ol√©, Allah, magnificent, bravo," incomprehensible, there it is -- a glimpse of God.
Which is great, because we need that.
But, the tricky bit comes the next morning, for the dancer himself, when he wakes up and discovers that it's Tuesday at 11 a.m., and he's no longer a glimpse of God.
He's just an aging mortal with really bad knees, and maybe he's never going to ascend to that height again.
And maybe nobody will ever chant God's name again as he spins, and what is he then to do with the rest of his life?
This is hard.
This is one of the most painful reconciliations to make in a creative life.
But maybe it doesn't have to be quite so full of anguish if you never happened to believe, in the first place, that the most extraordinary aspects of your being came from you.
But maybe if you just believed that they were on loan to you from some unimaginable source for some exquisite portion of your life to be passed along when you're finished, with somebody else.
And, you know, if we think about it this way, it starts to change everything.
This is how I've started to think, and this is certainly how I've been thinking in the last few months as I've been working on the book that will soon be published, as the dangerously, frighteningly over-anticipated follow up to my freakish success.
And what I have to sort of keep telling myself when I get really psyched out about that is don't be afraid.
Don't be daunted.
Just do your job.
Continue to show up for your piece of it, whatever that might be.
If your job is to dance, do your dance.
If the divine, cockeyed genius assigned to your case decides to let some sort of wonderment be glimpsed, for just one moment through your efforts, then "Ol√©!"
And if not, do your dance anyhow.
And "Ol√©!" to you, nonetheless.
I believe this and I feel that we must teach it.
"Ol√©!" to you, nonetheless, just for having the sheer human love and stubbornness to keep showing up.
Thank you.
(Applause)
Thank you.
(Applause)
June Cohen:
Ol√©!
(Applause)
-CHAPTER 15
'I did not start in search of Jim at once, only because I had really an appointment which I could not neglect.
Then, as ill-luck would have it, in my agent's office I was fastened upon by a fellow fresh from Madagascar with a little scheme for a wonderful piece of business.
It had something to do with cattle and cartridges and a Prince Ravonalo something; but the pivot of the whole affair was the stupidity of some admiral--Admiral Pierre,
I think.
Everything turned on that, and the chap couldn't find words strong enough to express his confidence.
He had globular eyes starting out of his head with a fishy glitter, bumps on his forehead, and wore his long hair brushed back without a parting.
He had a favourite phrase which he kept on repeating triumphantly, "The minimum of risk with the maximum of profit is my motto.
What?"
He made my head ache, spoiled my tiffin, but got his own out of me all right; and as soon as I had shaken him off, I made straight for the water-side.
I caught sight of Jim leaning over the parapet of the quay.
Three native boatmen quarrelling over five annas were making an awful row at his elbow.
He didn't hear me come up, but spun round as if the slight contact of my finger had released a catch.
"I was looking," he stammered.
I don't remember what I said, not much anyhow, but he made no difficulty in following me to the hotel.
'He followed me as manageable as a little child, with an obedient air, with no sort of manifestation, rather as though he had been waiting for me there to come along and carry him off.
I need not have been so surprised as I was at his tractability.
On all the round earth, which to some seems so big and that others affect to consider as rather smaller than a mustard-seed, he had no place where he could--what shall I say?--where he could withdraw.
That's it!
Withdraw--be alone with his loneliness.
He walked by my side very calm, glancing here and there, and once turned his head to look after a Sidiboy fireman in a cutaway coat and yellowish trousers, whose black face had silky gleams like a lump of anthracite coal.
I doubt, however, whether he saw anything, or even remained all the time aware of my companionship, because if I had not edged him to the left here, or pulled him to the right there, I believe he would have gone straight before him in any direction till stopped by a wall or some other obstacle.
I steered him into my bedroom, and sat down at once to write letters.
This was the only place in the world (unless, perhaps, the Walpole Reef--but that was not so handy) where he could have it out with himself without being bothered by the rest of the universe.
The damned thing--as he had expressed it-- had not made him invisible, but I behaved exactly as though he were.
No sooner in my chair I bent over my writing-desk like a medieval scribe, and, but for the movement of the hand holding the pen, remained anxiously quiet.
I can't say I was frightened; but I certainly kept as still as if there had been something dangerous in the room, that at the first hint of a movement on my part would be provoked to pounce upon me.
There was not much in the room--you know how these bedrooms are--a sort of four- poster bedstead under a mosquito-net, two or three chairs, the table I was writing at, a bare floor.
A glass door opened on an upstairs verandah, and he stood with his face to it, having a hard time with all possible privacy.
Dusk fell; I lit a candle with the greatest economy of movement and as much prudence as though it were an illegal proceeding.
There is no doubt that he had a very hard time of it, and so had I, even to the point, I must own, of wishing him to the devil, or on Walpole Reef at least.
It occurred to me once or twice that, after all, Chester was, perhaps, the man to deal effectively with such a disaster.
That strange idealist had found a practical use for it at once--unerringly, as it were.
It was enough to make one suspect that, maybe, he really could see the true aspect of things that appeared mysterious or utterly hopeless to less imaginative persons.
I wrote and wrote; I liquidated all the arrears of my correspondence, and then went on writing to people who had no reason whatever to expect from me a gossipy letter about nothing at all.
At times I stole a sidelong glance.
He was rooted to the spot, but convulsive shudders ran down his back; his shoulders would heave suddenly.
He was fighting, he was fighting--mostly for his breath, as it seemed.
The massive shadows, cast all one way from the straight flame of the candle, seemed possessed of gloomy consciousness; the immobility of the furniture had to my furtive eye an air of attention.
I was becoming fanciful in the midst of my industrious scribbling; and though, when the scratching of my pen stopped for a moment, there was complete silence and stillness in the room, I suffered from that profound disturbance and confusion of thought which is caused by a violent and menacing uproar--of a heavy gale at sea, for instance.
Some of you may know what I mean: that mingled anxiety, distress, and irritation with a sort of craven feeling creeping in-- not pleasant to acknowledge, but which gives a quite special merit to one's endurance.
I don't claim any merit for standing the stress of Jim's emotions; I could take refuge in the letters; I could have written to strangers if necessary.
Suddenly, as I was taking up a fresh sheet of notepaper, I heard a low sound, the first sound that, since we had been shut up together, had come to my ears in the dim stillness of the room.
I remained with my head down, with my hand arrested.
Those who have kept vigil by a sick-bed have heard such faint sounds in the stillness of the night watches, sounds wrung from a racked body, from a weary soul.
He pushed the glass door with such force that all the panes rang: he stepped out, and I held my breath, straining my ears without knowing what else I expected to hear.
He was really taking too much to heart an empty formality which to Chester's rigorous criticism seemed unworthy the notice of a man who could see things as they were.
An empty formality; a piece of parchment.
Well, well.
As to an inaccessible guano deposit, that was another story altogether.
One could intelligibly break one's heart over that.
A feeble burst of many voices mingled with the tinkle of silver and glass floated up from the dining-room below; through the open door the outer edge of the light from my candle fell on his back faintly; beyond all was black; he stood on the brink of a vast obscurity, like a lonely figure by the shore of a sombre and hopeless ocean.
There was the Walpole Reef in it--to be sure--a speck in the dark void, a straw for the drowning man.
My compassion for him took the shape of the thought that I wouldn't have liked his people to see him at that moment.
I found it trying myself.
His back was no longer shaken by his gasps; he stood straight as an arrow, faintly visible and still; and the meaning of this stillness sank to the bottom of my soul like lead into the water, and made it so heavy that for a second I wished heartily that the only course left open for me was to pay for his funeral.
Even the law had done with him.
To bury him would have been such an easy kindness!
It would have been so much in accordance with the wisdom of life, which consists in putting out of sight all the reminders of our folly, of our weakness, of our mortality; all that makes against our efficiency--the memory of our failures, the hints of our undying fears, the bodies of our dead friends.
Perhaps he did take it too much to heart.
And if so then--Chester's offer....At this point I took up a fresh sheet and began to write resolutely.
There was nothing but myself between him and the dark ocean.
I had a sense of responsibility.
If I spoke, would that motionless and suffering youth leap into the obscurity-- clutch at the straw?
I found out how difficult it may be sometimes to make a sound.
There is a weird power in a spoken word.
And why the devil not?
I was asking myself persistently while I drove on with my writing.
All at once, on the blank page, under the very point of the pen, the two figures of
Chester and his antique partner, very distinct and complete, would dodge into view with stride and gestures, as if reproduced in the field of some optical toy.
I would watch them for a while.
No!
They were too phantasmal and extravagant to enter into any one's fate.
And a word carries far--very far--deals destruction through time as the bullets go flying through space.
I said nothing; and he, out there with his back to the light, as if bound and gagged by all the invisible foes of man, made no stir and made no sound.'
CHAPTER 16
'The time was coming when I should see him loved, trusted, admired, with a legend of strength and prowess forming round his name as though he had been the stuff of a hero.
It's true--I assure you; as true as I'm sitting here talking about him in vain.
He, on his side, had that faculty of beholding at a hint the face of his desire and the shape of his dream, without which the earth would know no lover and no adventurer.
He captured much honour and an Arcadian happiness (I won't say anything about innocence) in the bush, and it was as good to him as the honour and the Arcadian happiness of the streets to another man.
Felicity, felicity--how shall I say it?--is quaffed out of a golden cup in every
latitude: the flavour is with you--with you alone, and you can make it as intoxicating as you please.
He was of the sort that would drink deep, as you may guess from what went before.
I found him, if not exactly intoxicated, then at least flushed with the elixir at his lips.
He had not obtained it at once.
There had been, as you know, a period of probation amongst infernal ship-chandlers, during which he had suffered and I had worried about--about--my trust--you may call it.
I don't know that I am completely reassured now, after beholding him in all his brilliance.
That was my last view of him--in a strong light, dominating, and yet in complete accord with his surroundings--with the life of the forests and with the life of men.
I own that I was impressed, but I must admit to myself that after all this is not the lasting impression.
He was protected by his isolation, alone of his own superior kind, in close touch with
Nature, that keeps faith on such easy terms with her lovers.
But I cannot fix before my eye the image of his safety.
I shall always remember him as seen through the open door of my room, taking, perhaps, too much to heart the mere consequences of his failure.
I am pleased, of course, that some good-- and even some splendour--came out of my endeavours; but at times it seems to me it would have been better for my peace of mind if I had not stood between him and Chester's confoundedly generous offer.
I wonder what his exuberant imagination would have made of Walpole islet--that most hopelessly forsaken crumb of dry land on the face of the waters.
It is not likely I would ever have heard, for I must tell you that Chester, after calling at some Australian port to patch up his brig-rigged sea-anachronism, steamed out into the Pacific with a crew of twenty- two hands all told, and the only news having a possible bearing upon the mystery of his fate was the news of a hurricane which is supposed to have swept in its course over the Walpole shoals, a month or so afterwards.
Not a vestige of the Argonauts ever turned up; not a sound came out of the waste.
Finis!
The Pacific is the most discreet of live, hot-tempered oceans: the chilly Antarctic can keep a secret too, but more in the manner of a grave.
'And there is a sense of blessed finality in such discretion, which is what we all more or less sincerely are ready to admit-- for what else is it that makes the idea of death supportable?
End!
Finis! the potent word that exorcises from the house of life the haunting shadow of fate.
This is what--notwithstanding the testimony of my eyes and his own earnest assurances--
I miss when I look back upon Jim's success.
While there's life there is hope, truly; but there is fear too.
I don't mean to say that I regret my action, nor will I pretend that I can't sleep o' nights in consequence; still, the idea obtrudes itself that he made so much of his disgrace while it is the guilt alone that matters.
He was not--if I may say so--clear to me.
He was not clear.
And there is a suspicion he was not clear to himself either.
There were his fine sensibilities, his fine feelings, his fine longings--a sort of sublimated, idealised selfishness.
He was--if you allow me to say so--very fine; very fine--and very unfortunate.
A little coarser nature would not have borne the strain; it would have had to come to terms with itself--with a sigh, with a grunt, or even with a guffaw; a still coarser one would have remained invulnerably ignorant and completely uninteresting.
'But he was too interesting or too unfortunate to be thrown to the dogs, or even to Chester.
I felt this while I sat with my face over the paper and he fought and gasped, struggling for his breath in that terribly stealthy way, in my room; I felt it when he rushed out on the verandah as if to fling himself over--and didn't; I felt it more and more all the time he remained outside, faintly lighted on the background of night, as if standing on the shore of a sombre and hopeless sea.
'An abrupt heavy rumble made me lift my head.
The noise seemed to roll away, and suddenly a searching and violent glare fell on the blind face of the night.
The sustained and dazzling flickers seemed to last for an unconscionable time.
The growl of the thunder increased steadily while I looked at him, distinct and black, planted solidly upon the shores of a sea of light.
At the moment of greatest brilliance the darkness leaped back with a culminating crash, and he vanished before my dazzled eyes as utterly as though he had been blown to atoms.
A blustering sigh passed; furious hands seemed to tear at the shrubs, shake the tops of the trees below, slam doors, break window-panes, all along the front of the building.
He stepped in, closing the door behind him, and found me bending over the table: my sudden anxiety as to what he would say was very great, and akin to a fright.
"May I have a cigarette?" he asked.
I gave a push to the box without raising my head.
"I want--want--tobacco," he muttered.
I became extremely buoyant.
"Just a moment."
I grunted pleasantly.
He took a few steps here and there.
"That's over," I heard him say.
A single distant clap of thunder came from the sea like a gun of distress.
"The monsoon breaks up early this year," he remarked conversationally, somewhere behind me.
This encouraged me to turn round, which I did as soon as I had finished addressing the last envelope.
He was smoking greedily in the middle of the room, and though he heard the stir I made, he remained with his back to me for a time.
'"Come--I carried it off pretty well," he said, wheeling suddenly.
"Something's paid off--not much.
I wonder what's to come."
His face did not show any emotion, only it appeared a little darkened and swollen, as though he had been holding his breath.
He smiled reluctantly as it were, and went on while I gazed up at him mutely...."Thank you, though--your room--jolly convenient-- for a chap--badly hipped."...
The rain pattered and swished in the garden; a water-pipe (it must have had a hole in it) performed just outside the window a parody of blubbering woe with funny sobs and gurgling lamentations, interrupted by jerky spasms of silence...."A bit of shelter," he mumbled and ceased.
'A flash of faded lightning darted in through the black framework of the windows and ebbed out without any noise.
I was thinking how I had best approach him (I did not want to be flung off again) when he gave a little laugh.
"No better than a vagabond now"...the end of the cigarette smouldered between his fingers..."without a single--single," he pronounced slowly; "and yet ..."
He paused; the rain fell with redoubled violence.
"Some day one's bound to come upon some sort of chance to get it all back again.
Must!" he whispered distinctly, glaring at my boots.
'I did not even know what it was he wished so much to regain, what it was he had so terribly missed.
It might have been so much that it was impossible to say.
A piece of ass's skin, according to Chester....
He looked up at me inquisitively.
If life's long enough," I muttered through my teeth with unreasonable animosity.
"Don't reckon too much on it."
'"Jove!
I feel as if nothing could ever touch me," he said in a tone of sombre conviction.
"If this business couldn't knock me over, then there's no fear of there being not enough time to--climb out, and ..."
He looked upwards.
'It struck me that it is from such as he that the great army of waifs and strays is recruited, the army that marches down, down into all the gutters of the earth.
As soon as he left my room, that "bit of shelter," he would take his place in the ranks, and begin the journey towards the bottomless pit.
I at least had no illusions; but it was I, too, who a moment ago had been so sure of the power of words, and now was afraid to speak, in the same way one dares not move for fear of losing a slippery hold.
It is when we try to grapple with another man's intimate need that we perceive how incomprehensible, wavering, and misty are the beings that share with us the sight of the stars and the warmth of the sun.
It is as if loneliness were a hard and absolute condition of existence; the envelope of flesh and blood on which our eyes are fixed melts before the outstretched hand, and there remains only the capricious, unconsolable, and elusive spirit that no eye can follow, no hand can grasp.
It was the fear of losing him that kept me silent, for it was borne upon me suddenly and with unaccountable force that should I let him slip away into the darkness I would never forgive myself.
'"Well.
Thanks--once more.
You've been--er--uncommonly--really there's no word to...Uncommonly!
I don't know why, I am sure.
I am afraid I don't feel as grateful as I would if the whole thing hadn't been so brutally sprung on me.
Because at bottom...you, yourself ..."
He stuttered.
'"Possibly," I struck in. He frowned.
'"All the same, one is responsible." He watched me like a hawk.
'"And that's true, too," I said.
I've gone with it to the end, and I don't intend to let any man cast it in my teeth without--without--resenting it."
He clenched his fist.
'"There's yourself," I said with a smile-- mirthless enough, God knows--but he looked at me menacingly.
"That's my business," he said.
An air of indomitable resolution came and went upon his face like a vain and passing shadow.
Next moment he looked a dear good boy in trouble, as before.
He flung away the cigarette.
"Good-bye," he said, with the sudden haste of a man who had lingered too long in view of a pressing bit of work waiting for him; and then for a second or so he made not the slightest movement.
The downpour fell with the heavy uninterrupted rush of a sweeping flood, with a sound of unchecked overwhelming fury that called to one's mind the images of collapsing bridges, of uprooted trees, of undermined mountains.
No man could breast the colossal and headlong stream that seemed to break and swirl against the dim stillness in which we were precariously sheltered as if on an island.
The perforated pipe gurgled, choked, spat, and splashed in odious ridicule of a swimmer fighting for his life.
"It is raining," I remonstrated, "and I ..."
"Rain or shine," he began brusquely, checked himself, and walked to the window.
"Perfect deluge," he muttered after a while: he leaned his forehead on the glass.
"It's dark, too."
'"Yes, it is very dark," I said.
'He pivoted on his heels, crossed the room, and had actually opened the door leading into the corridor before I leaped up from my chair.
"Wait," I cried, "I want you to ..." "I can't dine with you again to-night," he flung at me, with one leg out of the room already.
"I haven't the slightest intention to ask you," I shouted.
At this he drew back his foot, but remained mistrustfully in the very doorway.
I lost no time in entreating him earnestly not to be absurd; to come in and shut the door.'
CHAPTER 17
'He came in at last; but I believe it was mostly the rain that did it; it was falling just then with a devastating violence which quieted down gradually while we talked.
His manner was very sober and set; his bearing was that of a naturally taciturn man possessed by an idea.
My talk was of the material aspect of his position; it had the sole aim of saving him from the degradation, ruin, and despair that out there close so swiftly upon a friendless, homeless man; I pleaded with him to accept my help; I argued reasonably: and every time I looked up at that absorbed smooth face, so grave and youthful, I had a disturbing sense of being no help but rather an obstacle to some mysterious, inexplicable, impalpable striving of his wounded spirit.
'"I suppose you intend to eat and drink and to sleep under shelter in the usual way,"
I remember saying with irritation.
"You say you won't touch the money that is due to you."...He came as near as his sort can to making a gesture of horror.
(There were three weeks and five days' pay owing him as mate of the Patna.)
"Well, that's too little to matter anyhow; but what will you do to-morrow?
Where will you turn?
You must live ..."
"That isn't the thing," was the comment that escaped him under his breath.
I ignored it, and went on combating what I assumed to be the scruples of an exaggerated delicacy.
"On every conceivable ground," I concluded, "you must let me help you."
"You can't," he said very simply and gently, and holding fast to some deep idea which I could detect shimmering like a pool of water in the dark, but which I despaired of ever approaching near enough to fathom.
I surveyed his well-proportioned bulk.
"At any rate," I said, "I am able to help what I can see of you.
I don't pretend to do more."
He shook his head sceptically without looking at me.
I got very warm.
"But I can," I insisted.
"I can do even more.
I am doing more.
I am trusting you ..."
"The money ..." he began.
"Upon my word you deserve being told to go to the devil," I cried, forcing the note of indignation.
He was startled, smiled, and I pressed my attack home.
"It isn't a question of money at all.
You are too superficial," I said (and at the same time I was thinking to myself:
Well, here goes!
And perhaps he is, after all).
"Look at the letter I want you to take.
I am writing to a man of whom I've never asked a favour, and I am writing about you in terms that one only ventures to use when speaking of an intimate friend.
I make myself unreservedly responsible for you.
That's what I am doing. And really if you will only reflect a little what that means ..."
'He lifted his head.
The rain had passed away; only the water- pipe went on shedding tears with an absurd drip, drip outside the window.
It was very quiet in the room, whose shadows huddled together in corners, away from the still flame of the candle flaring upright in the shape of a dagger; his face after a while seemed suffused by a reflection of a soft light as if the dawn had broken already.
'"Jove!" he gasped out.
"It is noble of you!"
'Had he suddenly put out his tongue at me in derision, I could not have felt more humiliated.
I thought to myself--Serve me right for a sneaking humbug....His eyes shone straight into my face, but I perceived it was not a mocking brightness.
All at once he sprang into jerky agitation, like one of those flat wooden figures that are worked by a string.
His arms went up, then came down with a slap.
He became another man altogether.
"And I had never seen," he shouted; then suddenly bit his lip and frowned.
"What a bally ass I've been," he said very slow in an awed tone...."You are a brick!" he cried next in a muffled voice.
He snatched my hand as though he had just then seen it for the first time, and dropped it at once.
"Why! this is what I--you--I ..." he stammered, and then with a return of his old stolid, I may say mulish, manner he began heavily, "I would be a brute now if I ..." and then his voice seemed to break.
"That's all right," I said.
I was almost alarmed by this display of feeling, through which pierced a strange elation.
I had pulled the string accidentally, as it were; I did not fully understand the working of the toy.
"I must go now," he said.
"Jove!
You have helped me.
Can't sit still.
The very thing ..." He looked at me with puzzled admiration.
"The very thing ..."
'Of course it was the thing.
It was ten to one that I had saved him from starvation--of that peculiar sort that is almost invariably associated with drink.
This was all.
I had not a single illusion on that score, but looking at him, I allowed myself to wonder at the nature of the one he had, within the last three minutes, so evidently taken into his bosom.
I had forced into his hand the means to carry on decently the serious business of life, to get food, drink, and shelter of the customary kind while his wounded spirit, like a bird with a broken wing, might hop and flutter into some hole to die quietly of inanition there.
This is what I had thrust upon him: a definitely small thing; and--behold!--by the manner of its reception it loomed in the dim light of the candle like a big, indistinct, perhaps a dangerous shadow.
"You don't mind me not saying anything appropriate," he burst out.
Last night already you had done me no end of good.
Listening to me--you know.
I give you my word I've thought more than once the top of my head would fly off..."
He darted--positively darted--here and there, rammed his hands into his pockets, jerked them out again, flung his cap on his head.
I had no idea it was in him to be so airily brisk.
I thought of a dry leaf imprisoned in an eddy of wind, while a mysterious apprehension, a load of indefinite doubt, weighed me down in my chair.
He stood stock-still, as if struck motionless by a discovery.
"You have given me confidence," he declared, soberly.
"Oh! for God's sake, my dear fellow-- don't!"
I entreated, as though he had hurt me.
"All right.
I'll shut up now and henceforth.
Can't prevent me thinking though....Never mind!...I'll show yet ..."
He went to the door in a hurry, paused with his head down, and came back, stepping deliberately.
"I always thought that if a fellow could begin with a clean slate...And now you...in a measure...yes...clean slate."
I waved my hand, and he marched out without looking back; the sound of his footfalls died out gradually behind the closed door-- the unhesitating tread of a man walking in broad daylight.
'But as to me, left alone with the solitary candle, I remained strangely unenlightened.
I was no longer young enough to behold at every turn the magnificence that besets our insignificant footsteps in good and in evil.
I smiled to think that, after all, it was yet he, of us two, who had the light.
And I felt sad.
A clean slate, did he say?
As if the initial word of each our destiny were not graven in imperishable characters upon the face of a rock.'
Hey everybody.
This is Rick.
Before we start today's episode.
I want to show you a clip from our upcoming Christmas show. which is available exclusively on our DVD.
And believe me, when you see this you'll know how difficult this was for me to shoot.
Dude, what's up?
It's tradition.
What the fuck!
Seriously, again?!
Okay, I may have blown a few takes so I could do that scene over and over and over again.
If you've already bought our DVD thank you so much.
If not, please go to wherethebearsare.tv and order one today.
We really want to do a 2nd Season.
But, we can only do it if everybody buys 1 or 2 or 3 copies
So enjoy today's episode.
I personally can't watch this one because it's way too scary.
So, what do you want to do today?
Wanna go for a bike ride or take a hike?
Yeah right.
I know you were only suggesting that for my benefit.
Which is sweet.
But I want to do what you want to do today.
Which I imagine is, get take out and watch All About Eve, again.
You are too good to me.
Hey, can I use your laptop to order up a meat-lovers pizza?
Okay, I've got my own meat-lover right here.
But pizza sounds good too.
I'm gonna grab a shower in the meantime.
So don't go looking through my inbox, looking for any ex boyfriends.
Don't be silly.
You know, I'd never do that.
Uh huh.
Alright, Palm Springs Pizza.
Old boyfriends huh?
Well, it won't hurt to just check the sent emails.
J Cub, After living with you all these months I realize I love you.
J Cub, I was hoping for an email back.
Did you get my last email?
J Cub, Please tell me how you feel!!!
I am crazy about you!
J Cub, I'm beginning to think you are an ASSHOLE!
YOU ARE AN ASSHOLE ASSHOLE ASSHOLE!!!
I CAN'T BELlEVE I WAS EVER ATTRACTED TO A FUCKlNG PElCE OF SHlT LlKE YOU!!!!
GET READY TO DlE:):):):)
DlE! DlE!
DlE! DlE!
DlE! DlE!
Wood and Reggie were right!
He's J Cub's killer!
I gotta get out of here.
Oh my God.
Oh my God.
Alright, I'm gonna go to the police station.
I'm gonna call Wood and Reggie.
And tell them the guy I'm dating is a killer.
Hiding from me?
No, why would you say that?
What are you doing?
They won't deliver.
I have to go get it.
Well, I'll go with you.
No, no, no!
You're all wet.
And it will take you too long to get dressed.
And I need pepperoni now!
Okay, but don't take too long.
Keys?
Keys?
Keys?
Jacket, they're in the jacket.
Jacket, get the keys.
Put them in my pocket.
Gotta go.
Good, you're still here.
I'm dressed now, so I can go with you.
No you can't.
Stop suffocating me!
Why can't you give me a minute to myself Mr. Clingy!
What are you doing with my laptop?
Yeah.
I got your laptop.
And I saw the emails Todd.
The ones you sent to J Cub.
These!
The ones where you were professing your undying love for him!
And he told you to go away.
But you got all angry and hostile and crazy!
I didn't write those.
I've never seen those before.
I swear to God!
They're on your computer!
I don't know how they got there.
It all makes sense now.
You and J Cub were both at my Birthday party.
And you followed him into the bathroom. Didn't you!
And you wanted to have sex with him!
What?
But he rejected you!
And you couldn't take that, could you!
So you decided to get your revenge!
No, Nelson.
That's not how it happened.
You got this all wrong!
Stay back!
He was the one trying to have sex with me for months!
I told him it wasn't like that.
That we were just friends.
But he wouldn't listen!
Yeah, well why didn't you tell that to the Police?!
Because I'm no fucking angel, Nelson!
I have a record!
I've been arrested twice for aggravated assault!
I din't want to tell you this!
I didn't want it to change the way you felt about me!
But if the cops showed up and I was there the night he died.
And there was this unrequited crush he had on me or something.
What was I suppose to do!
All fingers were gonna point to me being the killer.
You figured out a way to put the poison on J Cub's Martini glass, so that when I served it to him.
All it took was one sip!
One sip and he was dead in the bathtub!
Look, that's not how it happened.
You're jumping to conclusions!
Don't touch me!
Look, you're not thinking clearly!
Imagine, if you will -- a gift.
I'd like for you to picture it in your mind.
It's not too big -- about the size of a golf ball.
So envision what it looks like all wrapped up.
But before I show you what's inside, I will tell you, it's going to do incredible things for you.
It will bring all of your family together.
You will feel loved and appreciated like never before and reconnect with friends and acquaintances you haven't heard from in years.
Adoration and admiration will overwhelm you.
It will recalibrate what's most important in your life.
It will redefine your sense of spirituality and faith.
You'll have a new understanding and trust in your body.
You'll have unsurpassed vitality and energy.
You'll expand your vocabulary, meet new people, and you'll have a healthier lifestyle.
And get this -- you'll have an eight-week vacation of doing absolutely nothing.
You'll eat countless gourmet meals.
Flowers will arrive by the truckload.
People will say to you,
"You look great.
Have you had any work done?"
And you'll have a lifetime supply of good drugs.
You'll be challenged, inspired, motivated and humbled.
Your life will have new meaning.
Peace, health, serenity, happiness, nirvana.
The price? $55,000, and that's an incredible deal.
By now I know you're dying to know what it is and where you can get one.
Does Amazon carry it?
Does it have the Apple logo on it?
Is there a waiting list?
Not likely.
This gift came to me about five months ago.
It looked more like this when it was all wrapped up -- not quite so pretty.
And this, and then this.
It was a rare gem -- a brain tumor, hemangioblastoma -- the gift that keeps on giving.
And while I'm okay now, I wouldn't wish this gift for you.
I'm not sure you'd want it.
But I wouldn't change my experience.
It profoundly altered my life in ways I didn't expect in all the ways I just shared with you.
So the next time you're faced with something that's unexpected, unwanted and uncertain, consider that it just may be a gift.
(Applause)
Hello everyone.
And so the two of us are here to give you an example of creation.
And I'm going to be folding one of Robert Lang's models.
And this is the piece of paper it will be made from, and you can see all of the folds that are needed for it.
And Rufus is going to be doing some improvisation on his custom, five-string electric cello, and it's very exciting to listen to him.
Are you ready to go?
OK.
Just to make it a little bit more exciting.
All right.
Take it away, Rufus.
(Music)
All right.
There you go.
(Laughter) (Applause)
Honey~!
Hey, you can't kick that...
Jeez...
You haven't changed one bit.
Oh it's you, Boeun.
You're a big girl now.
Great body!
Nice curves.
Drop it, okay?
Hey, you little girl!
Hey, give me a break!
They look so nice and shiny...
Stop staring.
You'll sprain your eyes.
No, it's just that they look familiar.
Anyway, what brings you here?
Did you miss me so much that you had to skip school?
No, it's the school's anniversary.
I was forced to come here.
I'm wasting my time when I really have to study.
Yeah, there's only 2 years left till the national exam.
But people like you really make college look undesirable.
What do you mean?
You're a pervert and a playboy.
I may be a playboy, but I'm not a pervert.
Here's your present.
It's just for you!
Keep it a secret to the family.
Okay.
Pretty, isn't it?
It's padded.
Real thick.
You're a pervert!
Should I help you put it on?
- Should I?
- Do you want me to punch you?
- My son!
My son's home!
- How have you been?
- Welcome home.
- Thanks.
- How was your trip?
- Fine.
How have you been?
- Grandfather's waiting.
Hurry.
- Okay.
- Mom, it's heavy.
I'll carry it.
- Okay.
You've changed.
What was all the rush for?
And is grandpa really sick?
Son, brace yourself, okay?
Delicious, isn't it?
I made it myself, just for you, grandfather.
Really tasty.
No one but you can take such good care of me.
Of course, I'm your only granddaughter.
You've really grown.
Now you look like a lady.
She may have grown, but she's still a child.
I'd be married in the old days.
Right grandfather?
Absolutely.
A married woman.
- Sangmin, come sit here.
- Yes, grandfather.
You two, hear me out.
You may have heard this story before...
Sangmin's grandfather was an old friend and war comrade
When we were young, we made a pact,
To marry our kids.
But you two had only sons.
So, our pact was passed down to the next generation.
I hope you two can keep this promise.
What are you saying?
You idiot!
Grandpa wants you to marry Sangmin!
Marriage?
You must be joking grandpa!
Marry Sangmin?
Hey!
Your grandpa's not kidding!
I can die peacefully after you two get married!
This way, I can face Sangmin's grandpa.
How can a high schooler get married!
Anyone over 15 can marry with their parent's consent.
I haven't much time left, you know?
No, I won't.
Never!
Sorry grandpa but I'll forget what you just said.
He hasn't finished speaking!
I'm speechless myself.
It's me.
I'm back.
I'm back in Korea, standing in front of the department office.
Hey, there's lots of new blood in the department
- How are you?
- Oh, yeah.
The chicks are great!
Let's get together after class.
Hey, Sangmin!
What a surprise!
Has it been a year already?
No, I'm back for some family business.
How about you?
Great.
My looks...
- keep me too busy...
- Come on...
Come back when I'm the TA.
It'll help when you skip classes.
Would I, a model student, do that?
Besides, it's my last year...
Friend, my good friend!
- How have you been!
- Great dude!
Look at him!
Life in the West has done you well!
What brought you back?
Problems at home?
- Yeah something's up at home...
- Huh?
What?
- I'm getting married... damn.
- Huh?
Bastard!
Hey, is it a black or white girl?
Pounding!
Only you should know about it~ I'm just 17~
Come, come silently ~
Here and there~
Hey!
They're making such a fuss.
Losers...
- Shh!
They'll hear you.
- Why?
Do you think you're different?
My doctor said I have 20 more years to go!
Really?
Change of plans.
I'll make my move.
Just back me up.
I understand.
Good!
They switched it.
Isn't he the guy?
They switched it.
Remember?
Yeah...
I really wish they wouldn't play those things on TV.
I guess the wedding's really on.
What am I going to do, mom?
Be strong, son.
Grant your grandpa this one wish.
Let's call it a day!
You're Suh Boeun, 1st grade, right?
You were so funny, don't you agree?
Hey, what?
Come on!
Who's he?
He's just a guy I know.
That's what they all say.
I'm telling the truth!
I really thought about it, and I'll speak first.
- Let's just do it.
- Are you crazy?
I'm kidding.
Do you think I'd want to?
I don't want to do it with you!
Even if I did, it's insane.
I'm just 15!
Okay, I got it.
Anyway, I'll buy you dinner.
Or anything else you need.
Mister, you're a sugar daddy, aren't you?
- Boeun.
- Huh?
How can you do this to me?
I may be pretty, but something like this...
Hey...
Hyewon, stop it!
- I'll leave you two to talk.
- Huh?
See you later, Boeun.
- Remember, it's a secret.
- I know.
- Bye.
- Good bye.
- What's her problem?
- It's understandable.
Hello?
Yes...
What!
Good, good.
Grandpa!
- Grandpa!
- Grandpa!
Grandpa, we're here!
Grandpa, Grandpa!
Grandpa, Grandpa!
Wake up, Grandpa!
- Uncle, something's wrong!
- What?
Grandpa!
It's doing it again.
We should've gone to another hospital!
It almost gave me a heart attack!
I was out of myself again.
Are you okay, grandpa?
- Let's have a word outside.
- Okay.
Be by your grandpa's side, okay?
Yeah.
I'm really worried.
I know.
With the kids like that, he's getting worse.
Come on... marriage is out of the question!
They... you have to think about Boeun's future.
Come on, let's just marry the kids.
Let go.
Come on...
This is Sangmin's grandparents.
Soon after this picture was taken, war broke out.
Do you want me to tell you a secret?
Secretly, your grandpa had feelings for Sangmin's grandma.
She was quite a beauty.
However, after Sangmin's grandpa's death, I tucked those feelings away.
That's why I took care of Sangmin's father like my own son.
Your father may not have been so happy about this.
- Boeun!
- Yes?
Keeping this promise is the most important thing for me.
- Grandpa!
- Grandpa!
Grandpa, wake up.
Grandpa!
You can't die!
Open your eyes, grandpa!
Grandpa, I'll get married so open your eyes, grandpa!
I'll keep your promise, grandpa!
I'll get married...
Are you crying?
Stop crying.
You may be behind in your grades, but you're the nation's first to get married at this age.
Congrats, missus.
Right.
Are you scared that Sangmin will discover your lop-sided butt?
A butt that needs cushioning to keep it on balance?
- Hey, get out!
- Ouch, it hurts!
I'm sorry Boeun, for not being much help.
Mom, am I really getting married?
What about school?
I have to go to college...
Marriage won't change anything.
Marriage, accept it with grace.
It's nothing.
Just consider you're getting a new brother.
I'm scared that they'll find out at school.
How will I face everyone?
Don't worry.
Grandpa will take care of it.
Your grandpa was your principal's military senior.
Really?
Behold the face of a wolf who'll eat up a 15 year old virgin.
- Is it satisfaction or disbelief?
- Satisfaction, of course.
Shit, are you really my friends?
I can't be married at this age.
- To Sangmin!
- Cheers~
The chicks here are hot!
Let's go out on the floor!
Hello.
You're here.
Thanks.
You're here.
- Sir!!
- Yes, come in. Over here.
I won't forget this.
How could our field trip be at the same time?
I know.
You shouldn't keep it from your other friends.
If they found out, the whole school will know.
Then I'd have to quit school.
Anyway, you're so pretty today.
I wish I could get married too.
Look here!
Hey, smile!
- How are you doing?
- Hello.
- Don't take my picture.
- Okay, okay.
Good luck!
I'm convinced that grandpa scammed me.
- Boeun, it's just a wedding, okay?
- I can't do it, mom!
Now, don't be a baby.
I'm nervous myself.
I'm telling grandpa, "I can't do it!".
Do you want your wedding turned into a funeral?
I don't know.
I'm scared, mom.
What am I going to do with such a baby?
Now the groom will enter.
Welcome him with a big applause.
The groom, please enter!
She's so beautiful!
Respectable guests, family and relatives.
We are all gathered here to congradulate the new beginning of groom, Park Sangmin and bride, Suh Boeun...
- Dad, we'll be okay.
- Yeah, yeah.
Remember, she's only 15.
- What's your point?
- I know I can trust you.
You forced me into this marriage, so I'll do as I wish!
Boeun is still in high school!
I don't care!
I'll do as I wish with my wife.
Boeun, don't worry.
Your father-in-law has had a word with Sangmin.
About what?
- That you... shouldn't do it...
- What?
I can't say...
- Call us when you get there.
- Yes, auntie.
Stop calling her that.
It's mom from now on.
Yes, mom.
Hey, mom!
Can I keep the bouquet?
It was so pretty...
Forget the bouquet...
She's such a child.
What am I going to do with you?
Stop, you promised to be cool.
- Bon voyage~ - Yes, yes...
- Bye~ - Follow right behind, okay?
It's time to board, where is she?
Boeun.
- Boeun?
Where is it?
- Over there...
- Okay, we'll go inside, thanks.
- Okay, go.
- Thanks for everything.
- Don't overdo yourself.
- Have a safe trip.
- Yeah, give me the suitcase.
Have fun, Boeun.
Don't worry, dude. Be good, okay?
- See you later!
- Bye.
Bon voyage.
- I've never boarded on time...
- Wait.
- What?
- I need to go to the bathroom.
Again?
It's your first time on a plane, isn't it?
Don't worry.
It's only an hour to Jeju Isle.
It won't take long.
You're making such a fuss.
Hurry back.
- I'll be at our seats.
Hurry.
- Okay...
Shit.
Where is she?
- Sir, you must be seated.
- The plane's leaving.
Open the...
Sir, please seat yourself!
Mobiles are prohibited in the cabin.
Thank you for your cooperation.
He must think he owns the plane.
It must be his first flight.
I don't believe this.
Wait sir.
- We're in a hurry.
- Sorry.
Hey!
Did they arrive safely?
Yeah... they did.
I need to be clear about one thing.
Listen!
Until Boeun graduates from college, no grandchildren!
Make this clear to your father as well.
Yes, of course.
When she was little, she would fall and break things, but she seemed to hold herself well at the wedding.
It's a relief.
Why?
Are you disappointed that she didn't fall?
Yes, a little.
Come on...
Not those idiots again!
Having fun?
Hey!
Hey, do you have a place to stay?
Just this once.
Press anything.
Wind it and press.
Say cheese.
Take your best shot.
Uh, Sangmin?
I can't believe this!
What brings you here?
Boeun's on her honeymoon and we're on our fieldtrip.
- Don't you remember?
- Of course I do.
- Where's Boeun?
- Well...
- Hey!
Who's the mister?
- He's just a friend.
- He's cute.
- See you later!
- Hey, stop it.
Wait, come here.
- Oh god...
Hey!
What are you doing on top of her!
You pervert!
You chase after young girls, don't you!
It's not like that.
- I'm not...
- Really.
- Really?
- Really.
Then what are you doing?
- Uh?
- Huh?
Look at him running off!
Aren't you supposed to be on your field trip?
Yes...
Then why are you here?
What are you doing today?
Nothing.
Do you have a boyfriend?
No...I don't.
The cell phone you are tring to reach is off.
You will be transferred to a voice mail...
Pest, how can you do this to me...
Our parents shouldn't find out.
We'll talk later.
Bye.
Then, from now on we're dating.
Okay!
Hey you!
Come here!
Wow!
Looks so fun!
Isn't it?
- Where are you from?
- I'm from Canada.
Canada?
I know Canada!
Who am I kidding?
I've never set foot on Canada.
Teacher!
Teacher!
Hi, how are you?
Uh, Hyewon?
What brings you here at this hour?
It's free time for us.
Haven't you ever been on a field trip?
Of course I have.
Anyway, where's Boeun?
Why are you alone?
I don't even know where to begin?
It's like this...
Yes.
Boeun...
You're a serial pervert, aren't you!
Hey!
Come back!
Feels good, doesn't it?
It's been a while... together.
Sit here.
Stop.
Rest your back on this.
I feel great.
It's too late for this but I'm sure that we did a horrible thing to Boeun.
She's only 15, and going through her 1st year of high school.
Come on!
Be more positive.
You were considering him as your son-in-law anyway.
She's not going far away.
Let's have some faith, okay?
Besides, our in-laws love Boeun like their own daughter.
But, she's not their own daughter.
I can understand dad and you, but I still can't forgive you for it.
Okay, okay, that's enough... enough...
Without Boeun, it seems like there's a big hole in my heart.
Everyone looks like Boeun, that one too...
Candy, sir?
Thank you.
Candy, sir?
Boeun, help him.
Honey, honey, here.
Thank you very much.
- Grandpa!
- Dad, come on out.
- Sit, sit and eat.
- Okay.
So, how was your trip?
Good grandpa.
We had a good time.
Yes, Sangmin was kind to me.
I really had fun.
Stop, I didn't do anything.
I'm glad you had fun.
Since you're officially married, love one another so we can see the fruit of your love.
But you don't look so happy, Sangmin.
Are you sick?
Of course I'm not sick.
They're definitely a great couple, aren't they?
Your room's been cleaned, so go get some rest.
Yes sir.
Stop, we should have a drink with the new groom.
How about it dad?
Right.
My grandson-in-law should pour me a drink.
As you wish.
Grandpa, I'll go to bed now.
Yeah, yeah.
Go to your room...
Careful!
Honey!
Let's go!
- Hey!
Boeun's not a thing.
- Good night!
Hey!
Be careful.
Hey!
Hey!
- Have a good night.
- Good night!
Honey!
Ah, you're heavy!
And you stink of liquor!
Hey!
Hey!
- You're tearing my dress.
Stop it!
- Keep still!
He's coming on real strong.
This is the right place.
Come in.
Look at this tree.
Come in dad.
Close the door behind you.
What do you think?
Huh?
It's nice right?
Look at this, great isn't it?
It's a great place.
Great place Boeun.
- Hey, you put up that picture!
- Nice, isn't it?
Great huh?
Look at the balcony.
I chose this.
Boeun.
It's so clean.
Hey, look at this picture.
This picture.
Where should I put this picture?
You're having the time of your life, aren't you?
- What's this, Arabian Nights?
- Goodness!
- What's with the pillows...
- Goodness...
Separate rooms until you graduate, okay?
I am so pissed!
I like it...
What's this, a flower garden?
What am I going to do?
Stop it!
Language is part of culture...
Language is... a part of... culture...
When we learn of foreign languages, we should also learn about... that country's culture...
Ah, great!
Hey, stop!
Put something on!
I always take everything off.
Even my underwear.
Get out!
Out where?
This is my room.
What do you mean?
This is my room.
Yours is over there.
Get out!
I don't feel like it.
Let's sleep together.
What, you're crazy!
You sleep together when you get married.
Boeun...
What?
- I think tonight is the night.
- What?
Listen to me.
Stay away from me.
Come on.
We're married.
Boeun, do as I say!
Hey, stop it!
We're married!
Do as I say and stay still.
Shit...
I was just playing with you!
Oh my god!
Good morning, Boeun.
Your eyes are quite a sight!
Morning exercise?
What?
You disappeared from the airport?
Then what did you do during your honeymoon?
Who, me?
Can you keep a secret?
You have too many secrets.
I'm dating Jungwoo.
Jungwoo?
What about your husband?
Husband... are you kidding?
I was forced into it.
Then does Jungwoo know you're married?
No.
But I'm sure he'll understand.
Let's go.
If I call her, she'll be here in an instant.
Are you sure she'll come if you call her now?
Of course.
She'll say "Yes master" and then come.
You're such a liar.
Stop, she'll be studying anyway.
- Wait.
I'll show you.
- Dude, that's impolite.
- Tell her to come.
- Wait.
Wife!
It's me!
Your husband commands you to come!
Wow.
- Hurry!
- Wow.
- Hurry!!
- Wow.
Bye!
Now she'll fly here like a bullet.
Guys... let's drink!
I'm Sangmin.
I'm a man, ain't I?
Of course you're a man.
I'm just teaching my wife a lesson, like a real man!
A man of all men.
A real man.
Have a drink, men!
Men!!
Men, drink up!
Drink till we drop!
There'll be an inspection today.
Go home and study.
Wife!
She's my wife.
Come here wife!
- We're married!
- Not today.
He's really her husband.
Welcome, Boeun.
You saw her at the wedding, my wife, Boeun.
How could you call me over to such a place...
like this?
Your husband says it's okay.
Another beer please!
Don't.
Would you like a soda?
Yes...
A soda over here.
You're so adorable.
Thank you.
Of course!
My wife's adorable.
She's a horrible cook, with a bad temper.
And a bad student.
- She also snores.
- Sangmin!
You're drunk.
- Stop drinking, okay?
- No.
I'm jealous.
I have no one to worry about me.
- Wow, I feel great. Bottoms up!
- Bottoms up, bottoms up!
I never introduced myself.
I'm Sangmin's senior, Han Jisoo.
I'm Suh Boeun.
Boing, boing, Boeun.
She goes boing boing every morning!
Jisoo, do you know what she did to me on our honeymoon?
Hey, Park Sangmin!
Get off your butt!
Pretty please...
I'll see you again, Jisoo.
Yes.
I'm sure we'll be good friends.
Treat me like a little sister.
But you're my senior in life since you're married.
Stop joking.
Stop joking, stop joking.
You know, you two are made for each other.
We were always at each other's throats when we were little.
Hitting and teasing each other.
He's the first boy to flip my skirt.
Funny.
Boys are mean to girls they really like.
Jisoo, Jisoo, kiss me.
At least you could've fixed me something for my hangover.
You deserve it.
Besides, I'm still in high school.
You always use that line when you're cornered.
High school is not a crown, you know.
It is too, so there!
Okay, then I'll show you my cooking talents tonight!
- Hey, Suh Boeun!
- What?
- Let's go.
- Come.
Do you wanna get smacked?
Come!
What do you want?
I heard you were telling everyone you were Jungwoo's girl?
Fucking unbelievable!
She's boasting that she's slept with Jungwoo.
The bitch thinks we're shit.
How dare you, bitch!
Listen up.
Watch your mouth.
If I hear about this again, you're dead meat!
Jungwoo and I are in love!
Have you lost your senses!
Hey!
Didn't you get the message?
I didn't do anything wrong.
I'm leaving!
Hey!
How dare you...
Lose your attitude!
What are you doing!
Fuck off.
What?
Hey, Lee Jungwoo, you can't treat me like that!
You're in no position to say that to me.
Listen up.
It's true that Boeun and I are dating.
Don't mind them.
They think they're princesses.
But you're the real princess.
Sesame oil, sugar!
- A small bottle of oil?
- Yeah!
- This sugar?
- Hurry, hurry.
Okay!
Vinegar, spaghetti, ketchup!
There's the vinegar...
And there's the spaghetti!
Here?
Here, the ketchup's here.
Okay...
Hurry, hurry!
- Olive oil, pickles!
- Olive oil, pickles!
Boeun!
Are you okay, Boeun?
Boeun, Boeun, Are you okay?
Are you okay?
Ow, my leg!
It hurts?
- Does it hurt bad?
- No. Why?
Get off?
Stay put before I change my mind.
Don't touch me there!
I'm not doing it on purpose.
Why should I?
My hand just went there naturally.
What a great excuse!
Now walk straight.
You slant to the right because your butt is lop-sided.
Don't start with me.
I'm not kidding.
Your right butt has grown bigger.
Hey, stop it!
Stop it!
Hey, stop it!
Lop-sided butt~ Lop-sided butt~
- Stop it, stop it!
- Okay, okay!
- Ladies and gentlemen!
- Shut up...
Boeun has a lop-sided butt!
Lop-sided butt~
Look at how you're cutting.
You should put your heart into what you're cooking.
Just be quiet!
- Be quiet?
I'm older than you...
- Stop it!
Stop what?
I'm older... Hey...
You little...
- What?
- Take my sword.
- Pest... aim at what you can take.
- Hey, come here.
What are you going to do with that?
- Hey, stop it... it's hot.
Hot!
Hey...
- Hey...
Hey... that's not fair!
Ouch!
- It's delicious.
- Yeah.
You got something on your mouth.
The same with you.
Rock, paper, scissors!
Rock, paper, scissors!
Yes!
Make sure everything's spotless.
It's more important than cooking.
Give me a break!
Hey, is it this side?
Hey!
You pervert!
If I were you, I would help!
This picture's great.
I look so handsome.
Gotcha!
Sangmin...
Don't come near me!
Stop it!
Don't come near me!
Stop it, stop...
- Now, I'm taking everything off!
- Stop!
- Thanks, the sushi's great.
- Really?
The baseball field's empty.
Aren't people coming to watch the game?
No one comes to watch high school baseball anymore.
It's pro- baseball or the major league that they go to.
I hope you'll play in the major league some day.
Hey, Lee Jungwoo!
Good luck!
I'm starved.
Double crust seafood...
This is pretty good.
Lee Jungwoo, hurrah~
Give us a break.
Great pitching and now good batting?
She's quite a chick.
Why don't you share?
Shit.
Yes, that player's Lee Jungwoo.
An upcoming star in high school baseball!
Huh?
It's Boeun's high school.
Was I too generous?
That's doesn't look good...
Youngsters with raging hormones.
Something to do without.
But, I guess they'll grow out of it.
One cute student is quite passionate about a player.
- Ah, it's the sushi girl.
- Excuse me?
They were sharing a sushi lunch before the game.
Nice picture.
I see.
Can't you be more early?
- Were you still up?
- I've been waiting for you.
It gets dangerous at night.
Go to bed.
Okay.
- Sleep.
- Go to sleep.
- Yeah.
- Night.
- What's wrong?
- Don't you know?
What?
The whole school knows about you and Jungwoo.
- What's wrong with that?
- Do you think it's right?
You're married.
Just by law!
You know how things are!
What if Sangmin's parents and your's find out about this?
How can you be so selfish?
Why are you crying?
I like Jungwoo too!
There you are.
We're having a meeting at our place tonight.
I know.
You look great.
Your hubby must be treating you well.
- Hey!
- Yes?
- You live in apt.
106, right?
- Yes
There's an important meeting tonight, so tell your mom to come, okay?
- It's apt.
108.
- Okay.
- Hey!
- Yes?
You're such a cute little thing.
Thank you.
- Thanks for everything.
Bye. - Good night.
- Bye.
Take care.
- Thanks for tonight.
Where have you been?
Apartment meeting.
Look at him.
He looks like a sleazebag.
Yeah, he really does.
Looks mean as well.
What did you tell them?
How can you do this to me!
See you later.
Shit, why am I such a loser.
I envy you.
You have a husband and a boyfriend.
Next, next.
No.
2, Hulk, No.
3, Tiger Woods,
- No.
4 Zidane!
- Okay, Zidane!
Zidane, Zidane!
What is it?
Aw shit.
You should've knocked...
- Uh!
Jisoo...
- Jisoo...
You're here.
I have your assigned internship schools.
- Sangmin is Dongin High.
- What?
- Dongin High.
- Shit!
What is it?
What's wrong?
It's Boeun's high school.
Idiot!
Boeun...
Huh?
- You know...
- What!?
- What is it?
I'm late for school!
- Okay.
We'll talk at home, okay?
Bye!
Excuse me, but where is the faculty office?
Faculty office?
I don't know.
I loathe that place.
Wait for me!
Hey, who told you to dye your hair?
What a funky hairstyle!
Come here.
Excuse me!
Hey!
Your tea...
Thank you.
You should have told me.
You seemed too attractive to be a pervert.
Working out?
Sir, this is the new intern Park Sangmin.
Hello, sir.
Miss.
Kim, you may be excused.
Yes, we'll be seeing a lot of each other.
- How have you been, sir?
- Good.
- Take good care of Boeun.
- Yes.
- No one knows except for me.
- Right.
Last night I was at a disco club...
Do you know who I met there?
- Who?
- Our room teacher.
What?
She must've gone there to pick up men.
Old maid syndrome!
Quiet!
We have a new intern here.
- Wow, he's so cute.
- He's really cute.
Doesn't he look familiar?
Yeah, he does look familiar.
He's cute, though...
I'm Park Sangmin who will be teaching Art.
- I hope we get along.
- Yes!
Don't even think of playing tricks on Mr. Park, okay?
Yes, ma'am...
You all have a bright future, you know what I mean!
- Anything else?
- No, that's all.
Quiet!
Now, let's make a toast!
Cheers!
We'll spend the entire night toasting.
Mr. Park, bottoms up!
Mr. Park!
Now one from your supervisor.
- Here you go~ - Just a little bit.
- How is it, Mr. Park?
- Excuse me?
- The kids are hard to deal with, huh?
- No, I can handle them.
- Are you busy tonight?
- Yes, a bit...
Aw~ come on!
Aw~ come on!
It's a great coincidence that we're teaching the same class.
This calls for a celebration together!
No thank you!
It'll make your internship much easier.
One more round, okay?
Okay...
Mr. Park, let's go!
The second round.
When I first met you in Jeju Isle, I felt weird inside.
Miss Kim!
Wake up.
Please!
Don't take me easy because I'm a spinster!
I'll kill you if you do!
I don't believe this is happening!
Mr. Park...You know...
I went to a fortune teller earliar this year.
I'm supposed to marry a younger man.
What do you think about this?
What do you mean?
We talked about this before!
Don't take me easy!
I'll pound you with a brick if you do!
Miss Kim...
Miss Kim!
Miss...
Miss Kim, Miss Kim...
Where are you going Mr. Park?
Nowhere... drive on, mister.
Why are you up?
What?
Why didn't you answer your phone?
Your teachers all drink like fishes!
I couldn't keep up.
- Why of all schools is it mine?
- I know...
If the school finds out, I'm going to die!
Be careful!
I'll be careful.
Don't worry.
There won't be any rumors.
Don't worry.
Go to sleep.
Wash up!
You stink of liquor.
Okay.
Sleep.
Why should I be the only one to be careful?
- Hey!
- What!
I'll be careful.
What?
Sorry, but can I pee next to you?
- No!
- I'll turn around.
Boeun, I can't hold myself!
Oh my god!
What are you doing?
Hey!
Park Sangmin, what are you doing!
Didn't I warn you not to drink too much!
I feel like shit.
Now, focus!
Mr. Park.
Huh?
Get a grip on your wife.
Mr. Park!
Ah, yes, Miss Kim!
Isn't this adorable?
Mr. Park, what are you doing after school?
Well, my grandfather's sick.
- You must be the first son.
- I'm the only son.
Your family must have a weak male line.
We're all sons except for me.
Isn't it funny?
I'm just joking.
Mr. Park...
- It's okay.
- A bright smile.
- The kids are watching.
- Let them watch.
What's with the old maid?
She's caught her prey.
The old maid's pathetic.
She made the physical education teacher transfer to another school.
- Hello, sir.
- Hi.
Was it good?
Were you watching?
You seemed to really enjoy the cozy lunch together.
It was great.
Better than the school store's stale bread.
Jealous?
You're such a loser!
- Hello, sir.
- Uh, yeah.
- Hello, Mr. Park.
- Uh, yeah, hi.
- Is there a Lee Jungwoo here?
- Yes, that will be me.
- Are you Lee Jungwoo?
- Yes.
- So you're Jungwoo...
- Yes, I am Lee Jungwoo.
- Jungwoo, was the sushi good?
- What?
You look good.
Keep it up!
Shit!
- Having fun? - Yeah.
Hey, I was getting to the fun part!
They're all naked.
How could you say it's fun?
- Don't say that about my hobby!
- You call that a hobby?
- Give it to me!
- Forget it!
It's educational.
Give it back!
You should be ashamed of yourself!
I'm studying!
Then close the door!
- Stop watching!
- Shut up!
- Alright, so give it back.
- No.
- I'm sorry, so give it back.
- You're sorry?
It won't stop you from watching it again!
Gimme.
Okay.
Hey!
Do as you wish!
Hey!
Someone's at the door!
Jeez.
Boeun!
Boeun, Miss Kim's at the door!
Miss Kim?
What did you do to make her come all this way!
I don't know!
Hurry and clean this up.
Hurry!
Underwear, underwear!
Mr. Park~
- Mr. Park!
- Oh god!
- Oh, the door's open~ - Yes...
Oh, your place has everything.
- A woman could just fit in.
- Miss Kim, what brings you here?
Mr. Park, I came to do your dirty laundry.
- Is that your bedroom?
- Miss Kim!
- What's that?
- An automatic vacuum cleaner.
Automatic...it does everything by itself...
- Someone's here, Mr. Park.
It's a ghost, a ghost!
Who was that?
Who was it?
- It's my sister, she's a bit crazy... - Crazy?
It does seem like it...
Munch is a Norwegian painter.
A pioneer of expressionism, whose paintings were of angst and grief.
- Then there was...
- Mr. Park.
- Huh, what?
- Forget Munch...
Tell us about your first artwork in the deptartment Of romance.
- First artwork...
- Yes!
Let's continue the class!
- Your first love!
- Mr... tell us about your first love
Okay.
My first love was the only visitor during my three years of military service.
But that person doesn't know how much I like her.
Does she still do?
It must be Jisoo.
She may or may not know.
Now back to class.
How's the internship?
I'm so unlucky being stuck with a boys only high school!
How could you be lucky when you're not with the girls?
How about you, Sangmin?
Everything's great, thanks to you.
I felt that you two needed some time together.
The dude's having ball.
He goes to school where he can meet his pretty wife, and be surrounded by young high school girls.
How could he get bored there?
I'm bored out of my brains.
Seeing my bossy wife at school and at home...
Dude, you've got nothing but luck.
Take this.
What is it?
Military service...
It's tomorrow, so don't be late.
And bring coins to play coin games.
Your husband's off to serve his country!
Allegiance!
- No, it's "Victory!"
- Victory!
See you later.
Oh, and don't forget what I asked you to do.
Have fun.
Thank you.
Morning training's over!
Time has passed, but I still got the form, don't I?
Your beer belly is destroying the form.
- They're lining up.
- It's the lunch ration line!
Morons...
Thank you.
Hey, Sangmin, it's noodles...
- Fried tofu noodles?
- Yeah.
Can I have another bowl?
No, it's okay.
You're not eating, right?
Is that sushi?
- Victory!
- Victory!
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.
- I'm sorry.
I just brought only one.
- Don't worry.
It's okay.
Is it good, dude?
Don't talk to me.
It's delicious.
At least you could offer some.
- Want a piece of kimchi?
- Kimchi, kimchi...
Another piece would be nice.
A big piece!
Let go!
Aren't you marine Park?
Victory...
Victory!
Victory!
- Invincible!
- Invincible!
- Marines!
- Marines!
Once a marine, always a marine.
What do they want?
Marines are all like that.
- Do something!
- Ah, delicious.
Stop!
Don't touch anything!
Invincible...
Marines...
Mister, what do you think you're doing!
- Get up!
- This won't take long.
A feisty one, aren't you?
Are you his wife or what?
- Yeah, I am his wife!
- Sorry, she's my little sister.
What's there to hide!
How dare you push my hubby around?
Apologize!
- I'm a marine.
- Now!
- I'm a marine.
- My grandpa's a marine, too!
What's your year rank!
What year!?
Hey, Boeun...
Now, I'm leaving for the sea.
Casting a net to catch fish~ I am the romantic cat~ Meow~
My hot lips wish to touch your soft lips.
So my feelings can reach your heart~
If you still don't know.
More than anyone, I will love you ~
- I will love you~ - Forever~
- I will love you~ - Like this moment,
More than anyone, I will love you ~
We can't meet~ The feeling's important~
That's what I think~ I don't want things to be too simple~
Even if it may be just this once~ The feeling's important~
That's what I think~ I don't want things to be too fast~ I still don't know what love is~ Wait a little longer~ If you really love me~ You can wait a little longer~
If you really love me~ You can wait a little longer, even if it may be just once~ The feeling's important ~
I can't meet you, I can't~
Stop it.
Stop.
- Tickle, tickle~ - Stop~
- Nice picture.
- Hullo, hullo!
- Who are you people?
- We're hoodlums.
You're her sugar daddy, aren't you?
- Cute.
- Really cute.
Do you want to die by my hands!
Hey, I'd love to be her sugar daddy.
Sangmin, Sangmin, shit!
You're all dead meat.
Let go!
Can't you file a paper, right?
How can this high schooler be your wife?
They all say they're married to the girl when they're caught.
It's true.
I'm no sugar daddy.
You can check my record then.
Mister, it's true.
We're married.
You're both fucking with me, aren't you?
What is the world coming to?
I'm so pissed.
How could you get beat up like that?
How will you live in the real world!
How come everyone you meet is a bully?
I really worry about you.
- Stop...
- Keep rolling...
How will you go to school with a face like that?
I'm worried about school...
Everything will be okay.
Yeah...
Hello.
Attention!
For this year's school festival, our class is assigned to decorations.
No!
Quiet!
Stage decorations will be done by No.
1 to 15.
The stands and stairways, No.
16 to 21.
The Entrance, No.
23 to 32.
- And No.
22!
- Yes?
No.
22 will do the hall wall.
Alone!
That's all!
But, Miss Kim!
That's unfair.
How will Boeun paint that huge wall by herself?
Right!
I told her to do it herself!
So what!?
With my luck with men, what was I thinking?
You are huge.
Have you thought about what you'll paint?
No.
What do you mean?
Even if I wanted to help you, I can't, for fear of starting rumors at school.
I'm really worried.
I really worry about you, Boeun.
Do you know what I'm thinking?
Do you?
- Cut it out.
- Boeun!
Shhh!
Follow me.
Oh my...
I must be a lesbian.
I like my friend better than a boy.
If you're a lesbian, I'm a cheating wife.
Hey~ Your husband is so cute.
Stop talking about that loser.
He keeps staring at you during class.
He has a cool side to him.
Cool my ass!
Suh Boeun!
I know you're seeing Jungwoo with romantic feelings, but have you ever thought about Sangmin's feelings?
I really think you like Sangmin.
Am I right?
No...Sangmin's just like a big brother since we were little.
- Stop fooling around.
- You're always on my back.
- Hey, sew her mouth, shut.
- Uh?
Wow, look at all this food.
The table's barely holding up.
- Eat.
- Thank you for the meal.
Thank you for the meal, mom.
Easy.
Have you been skipping meals?
I've really been busy.
I missed your cooking, it's delicious.
You shouldn't say that, your wife's right here.
You'll hurt Boeun's feelings.
Mom, don't worry.
I'm undernourished.
When Boeun reaches twenty, you'll totally forget mom's cooking.
Boeun, I've put food in the fridge, so don't forget, okay?
There'll be more when you're done with it.
Yes...
Okay, it's late.
I'm leaving after dinner.
Yes.
Mom, it's raining.
Sleep over at your son's place.
Yes, mom.
Is it okay?
Sleep over, sleep over.
Eat, mom.
Oh, okay.
It's your son's place.
What's the big deal!
Oh, great.
So comfortable.
Turn around.
No, not this way, but the other.
Okay.
- Stay in that direction.
- Okay, pest.
- Are you asleep, Boeun?
- No...
You can't sleep?
- Sangmin, I thought about it...
- Yeah...
It's not fair to you.
Look at me, Sangmin.
What?
Did you know?
That you're really cute?
You're pretty yourself.
- Sangmin.
- Yeah, Boeun...
Boeun...
Sangmin, what are you doing?
- What do you think?
- Stop!
Wait, Boeun.
Uh, stop it!
Sleep.
Did we paint that much?
Let's hurry up with this.
There's not much time left till the festival.
- Hurry!
- Okay.
Hey, wait!
Gotcha, gotcha!
I see you've been working hard, but can you finish at this pace?
The festival's coming up.
Don't worry.
We'll be done by then.
Yeah, and it'll look great too.
Really?
We'll see about that...
I've seen enough...
Whatever...
The hag has appeared.
To find fault in our wall painting.
Miss Kim,
Miss Kim, with her nasty tone, she will...
I hate to admit it, but we've done a horrible job.
- It's okay.
- Really?
Let's wash our hands and grab some snacks.
Are you taking care of Sangmin's meals?
It's really hard to be an intern you know.
It couldn't be that hard!
Hey, but he's your husband.
Hey, I'm busy myself.
And he'll never skip a meal.
What kind of wife are you?
Then you be his wife.
Mrs. Park Sangmin.
Forget it.
I don't want it.
- Why the sudden interest!
- Shut up.
Hey, Park Sangmin!
Where are you?
Shouldn't you be helping me?
I couldn't believe it myself!
- Coke.
- Thanks.
- Good?
- Yeah.
- Eat up.
We'll be painting until dawn.
- What?
Hey, isn't she a babe?
She's the queen of Sunil Girls' Jr. High.
- Hey, let me see.
- Hey!
I'm going to make a move on her, so nice shots, please.
Okay.
Just don't get blown off.
From this day on, she's Suh Dongku's woman!
Excuse me, but, aren't you going to Sunil Girls' Jr. High?
Hey!
Over there.
Isn't that Dongku's sister?
Where?
It really is his sister.
Her husband looked older than that...
Then, who's that?
She must've fallen for a younger dude.
Nice.
The whole family's fooling around!
I got her number.
Did you get a good shot?
Here.
COME TO THE MONTHLY FAMlLY DlNNER BEFORE IT'S TOO LATE.
Jungwoo, I have to go home.
Already?
Hurry in and sit.
Can't you be more early?
Leave her alone.
It's okay.
Let's eat.
The chili squid was great...
Attention, please.
I'll now show you my girlfriend!
- Do you have a girlfriend?
- Yes, of course.
- Now take a good look.
- That's her?
She's better than your sister.
- Hey, look... look...
- Who's that?
Huh?
Hey, Boeun!
Hey!
Boeun!
When you were little, I always pushed you on this swing here.
You really loved it.
But one day, you fell off the swing while I was pushing.
I actually did it on purpose.
I'm sorry, Sangmin...
Everyone will be worried.
Let's go.
This marriage... it seems like your grandpa forced you into it, but in fact we wanted to have Sangmin as our son-in-law.
Do you remember?
How often you would cry?
But whenever Sangmin came, a smile would spread on your face.
You would fall all the time.
Scraping and breaking yourself.
Sangmin felt worse than I did.
He carried you on his back all the time, that Sangmin.
Anyway, I envy you.
The way he spends more time on your school festival than his graduation exhibition, I guess he's gone to paint the wall with Yongju and Youngchul...
Sangmin!
Sangmin!
Sangmin!
I came with the family to see you, but an emergency at your squad forces me to turn away.
Are you doing well?
A few days ago, heavy snow came down in Seoul.
The Han River is frozen as well...
It's colder here, right?
Don't catch a cold.
And this is a secret but my mom says that I've become a woman now.
I'm a bit behind than the other girls, but being an idiot that you are, you won't understand what I mean, will you?
It's strange but when you were around, I hated your guts, but your absence has me missing you.
Are you feeling the same?
Then be good to me from now on.
Stupid.
The disappointment of not being able to meet you has your mom crying.
Anyway, this letter, I hope it reaches you.
Where have you been?
I've been looking all over for you.
The wall's great.
- I... have something to say.
- Yeah, what?
I'm sorry.
I've been so selfish.
To you and...
What's got into you?
I'm breaking up with you.
I'm sorry, Jungwoo.
People laugh and dance but I hate to laugh~
While we drink and search for love, we forget about the truth~
Why are you late?
Did you see him?
Who?
Your husband or boyfriend?
I'm not kidding!
There he is.
I like the smiling clown~ Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah~ I like the clown who embraces sadness~
Aren't they great?
Now, intern, Park Sangmin will share a few words with us.
I thank everyone, the principal, all the teachers... and all the students for helping me finish this internship in one piece.
It may have been a short time, but personally, it has left me with precious memories I will carry for the rest of my life.
Mr. Intern, cut the boring crap and show us some honestly.
Mr. Park Sangmin is a married man.
Didn't you know?
Of course, it's not a sin to be married.
But in fact you're married to a 15 year old high school girl, right?
To Suh Boeun who's sitting right there...
Correct.
We are married.
But Boeun had no choice.
The only crime she's committed was granting her sick grandfather's last wish.
It was against her will to marry me.
She may be married, but she's still a 15 year old high school girl.
She goes crazy over a bowl of chili and spaghetti.
She loves cute stars and sushi- ...loving attractive baseball players.
Everyday, she's stressed over exams, and applying to university.
I hope you won't persecute Boeun's school life over a marriage document.
I beg you all.
Sangmin, I'm not a kid anymore.
Since I was little, you were always at my side.
I was never aware of the strange feelings...inside... but...
I think I'm in love with you...
Our poor Dongku.
She's the end of all your fun and play.
Fun and play...
I knew it since he was fixed on that school queen or whatever...
I can't believe grandpa fell for her grandmother.
- I can't believe it...
- She looks bright though.
Just consider it starting early!
Do it!
Do it!
Oh, shut up and peel the garlic.
I'm in no position to say this, but you can hide a lop-sided butt, but not lop-sized balls.
Anyway, congrats.
It's good that she doesn't have a clue.
Who would marry a lop-sized ball man if they knew, right?
Right.
Oh, you're here!
Oh, dad!
You're here.
I'm really getting into peeling these things...
Did you get married to peel garlic?
Mom!
Okay!
Say cheese.
One, two, three!!
So magic is a very introverted field.
While scientists regularly publish their latest research, we magicians do not like to share our methods and secrets.
That's true even amongst peers.
But if you look at creative practice as a form of research, or art as a form of R&amp;D for humanity, then how could a cyber illusionist like myself share his research?
Now my own speciality is combining digital technology and magic.
And about three years ago, I started an exercise in openness and inclusiveness by reaching out into the open-source software community to create new digital tools for magic -- tools that could eventually be shared with other artists to start them off further on in the process and to get them to the poetry faster.
Today, I'd like to show you something which came out of these collaborations.
It's an augmented reality projection tracking and mapping system, or a digital storytelling tool.
Could we bring down the lights please?
Thank you.
So let's give this a try.
And I'm going to use it to give you my take on the stuff of life.
(Applause) (Music)
Terribly sorry.
I forgot the floor.
Wake up.
Hey.
Come on.
(Music)
Please.
(Music)
Come on.
Ah, sorry about that.
Forgot this.
(Music)
Give it another try.
Okay.
He figured out the system.
(Music) (Laughter) (Applause) (Music)
Uh oh.
(Music)
All right.
Let's try this.
Come on.
(Music) (Laughter) (Music)
Hey.
(Music)
You heard her, go ahead.
(Laughter) (Applause)
Bye-bye.
(Applause)
So my challenge to you is what if you didn't have to do anything about anything at all.
Nothing at all, to do nothing at all to do about anything.
Yes, make a cup of tea because that does begin the trouble.
Whatever it is you have to do, answer the phone, make us appointment what I would love.
But it does not accompanied by this idea that there is something that I need to do to be stable in the awareness, is what if you didn't have to do anything about because I tell you that is chop forget about it.
If you touch this idea you believe it instantly into existence and then you have to believe another idea to remove it.
So why not drop both ideas in the first place and stay where you are?
You are simply here within reach.
All that arises for you, including this sense of spirituality forget about spirituality,
You are simply here within reach.
All that arises for you, including this sense of spirituality forget about spirituality, forget about enlightenment and forget about you also.
And what remains here that which cannot be from will of release.
It's just that simpler that simple.
Sometimes we over use the intellectual faculties.
Which are only meant to take you up to the seeing and thereby they said goodbye we have serve you not they would go.
Your simply here.
All this knowledge that we acquire called spiritual knowledge is only a mirror for the timeless to see itself.
And for what reason for no other reason than it's fascinated with its own recognition or something.
I don't see that the idea that something is difficult which is a persistent notion in the psyche of the human expression of consciousness that we are just have to do something to kind of sometimes we are speaking like also a sense that we must get something accurately. so I said no there is no accuracy in the self or everything is the self.
If you give up all your notions all your effort to try and get somewhere just drop it right here because you have the power to do it, just drop it.
Yes, just like you're sitting in a restaurant full of people thinking glasses and, and the utensils and stuff and talking and there is music and yet you can have a sweet conversation with your friends and you just have to do it because you don't let it in in the same way you don't let this thoughts in that there is something that I need to do to just to stay more present and the minute you are without this thought "hooo" your recognition is here.
You know what often times this moment of seeing is attended by great laughter.
There's nobody laughing, it just that it's seems too simple to be true.
Because how many books, how many libraries, how many cds, how many teachers, how many stories can it all be pointing to this simplicity.
My God!
What a joke!
What a strange thing that I simply am.
Some full acceptance of this ever-present truth happens as it were.
We can give it a title of grace, or sort of benediction or whatever it is but it simply happens.
--(Vic Gundotra) Sergey!
--(Sergey Brin) I've got a really cool event for you.
(cheers and applause) (Sergey)How are you doing?
Guys, we're going to do something pretty magical here.
And we have a special surprise for you.
We've got something pretty special for you.
It's a little bit time sensitive, so I apologize for interrupting.
You've seen some really compelling demos here.
They were slick, they were robust. This is going to be nothing like that.
(audience laughs)
This can go wrong in about 500 different ways.
So tell me now, who wants to see a demo of Glass?
(Cheers and applause)
So we've been really excited to test it for a few months.
The unit I actually really want to show you,
I lent to a friend, and he's going to be here momentarily. My friend's J.T. He does a lot of skiing, base jumping, wingsuiting, all sorts of crazy things.
--with his buddies. They have a few Glass units.
If you guys can maybe afford to wait that couple minutes... (audience applauds)
Maybe they'll bring them down!
(man in airplane) They're cheering for us.
All right, we're about to get into a Hangout here with J.T.
- (Sergey) Hey, J.T., J.T., can you hear me? - (J.T) Yes.
Hello, hello.
We might have a few technical issues. (J.T.) Can you hear me?
Yeah, yeah.
Hey, we're just down here in Moscone.
I've got a few thousand people here.
I was hoping to maybe get that unit that I lent you down here.
And I thought maybe you guys could show us a fun time on the way down.
Yeah, if you can hear me down there,
I've been listening to your speech through the Hangout.
- (J.T.) It's pretty cool. - (Sergey) Cool, cool.
I see you and friends are plenty close by there, any chance we can get a view out the window?
Heck, yeah.
It's beautiful up here. we had a visual on Moscone a minute ago.
(Sergey) All right.
This is a Hangout from Glass.
(audience cheers and applauds)
- (J.T.) Look at that! &gt;- (Sergey) Oh, yeah, yeah.
(J.T.) We're coming a little closer.
I think we're going to get you that device pretty quickly, actually. &gt;&gt;Sergey Brin:
I see the roof of Moscone there.
So if you guys can, you know, be safe, but get it down here in a hurry for us, we'd love to watch that. &gt;&gt;&gt; Okay.
Yeah, you'll have to standby.
So we've got a pretty good range.
It's kind of interesting.
People have watched us fly many times before.
But I don't think that the world's ever tagged along live for a ride. I mean, we're -- nobody really knows the outcome of this jump.
We're feeling really confident about it.
[ Laughter ]
&gt;&gt;&gt; How are you feeling, Pete? &gt;&gt;Sergey Brin:
We're all rooting for you.
What do you guys think, should they go for it?
[ Cheers and applause ] &gt;&gt;&gt; Not in position yet. About one minute, Sergey.
Maybe you've got to entertain the crowd a little. &gt;&gt;Sergey Brin:
That looks like the view down, that looks like a long way down. &gt;&gt;&gt; Turn it sideways. &gt;&gt;&gt; There's the ballpark. &gt;&gt;&gt; This is good.
Stop here. &gt;&gt;&gt; Yeah, Moscone center.
I've got a visual on you.
[ Laughter ]
&gt;&gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt;Sergey Brin:
So this is one of the things, as we've been experimenting with Glass, just the ability to really share.
And we've posted some pictures. But as we start to experiment, being able to share what you're seeing live is really amazing.
And, you know, we're not -- we don't know what's going to happen here. These guys are all really good.
They're trained.
And I have great confidence.
But this is -- this is a demo that -- &gt;&gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt;Sergey Brin: All right.
Door's open.
Door's open. &gt;&gt;&gt; Let's -- we've got time. &gt;&gt;Sergey Brin:
All right. Happy flight! &gt;&gt;&gt; You know what?
We can jump. &gt;&gt;&gt; Let's do it.
It's going to be beautiful. &gt;&gt;&gt; It's going to be perfect. &gt;&gt;&gt; Yeah! Look at that! &gt;&gt;Sergey Brin:
All right. &gt;&gt;&gt; Yooo!
San Francisco!
[ Cheers and applause ] &gt;&gt;&gt; All right. Everybody's super happy. &gt;&gt;&gt; Nice and close-in there. &gt;&gt;Sergey Brin:
They've got to get to the right place so they can hit the roof. &gt;&gt;&gt; Three, two -- &gt;&gt;Sergey Brin:
I'm going to take a few pictures to record this for posterity.
And they're off! [ Cheers and applause ] &gt;&gt;Sergey Brin:
All right.
And they're flying.
Live Hangout, through Google Glass. Four skydivers.
And they're under canopy. Chutes are open.
Woo-hoo!
[ Cheers and applause ] &gt;&gt;Sergey Brin:
Okay.
Where's Vic.
Vic, hey, look, this is a Hangout On Air.
[ Laughter ] &gt;&gt;Sergey Brin: So it's a little bit tricky landing on a building, as you might imagine.
I don't know if you have ever tried this kind of thing before.
But you can see all their perspectives now.
They're going to have to line up one after another to get down to the roof here. It's a little bit of a -- it's a pretty big roof, actually, which is great for their landing.
And you can see there's -- there's a little yellow arrow they're aiming for. It's pretty exciting.
Hopefully, they land it.
All right. And they're coming in.
First one's coming in. &gt;&gt;&gt; Woo-hoo! &gt;&gt;Sergey Brin:
All right.
[ Cheers and applause ] &gt;&gt;Sergey Brin:
Yeah! [ Applause ]
&gt;&gt;Sergey Brin: So, okay, folks, thank you.
Woo-hoo!
Hey, so the roof is a little bit big there, so it would take a while to run down the length of it. So we got, actually, a few bikers up there for this eventuality.
We've got them wearing Glass, too.
And there's our little package.
Let's see if we can -- let's see if we can get it here in a hurry.
Here we go.
First person with Glass, here are the bikers.
Yeah! Woo-hoo!
Here they come down.
And, you know, there's only one good way down the side of a building. &gt;&gt;&gt; Have fun. &gt;&gt;Sergey Brin:
It's pretty high up there if you haven't been there before. Don't try this at home, kids.
These are trained professionals. &gt;&gt;&gt; All right.
Now we've got to get down there. Wanna unplug me? &gt;&gt;Sergey Brin:
All right, they're going.
Wait, wait wait wait, whoa, whoa, whoa!
No, we're on the third -- Okay.
Sorry about that.
So this is pretty wild.
I've never seen that perspective before. And -- &gt;&gt;&gt; Special delivery. Bring that to Sergey. &gt;&gt;Sergey Brin:
We still have a couple of bikes.
Its a little bit of a long way.
I apologize.
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Sergey Brin:
[ Cheers and Applause ] &gt;&gt;Sergey Brin:
All right. Please stay in your seats, folks. Don't get into the aisles.
Please keep the aisles clear.
Here they come up.
[ Cheers and Applause ] &gt;&gt;Sergey Brin:
Yeah! Woo-hoo!
[ Cheers and Applause ] &gt;&gt;Sergey Brin:
Yeah. That was awesome.
All right. That was pretty amazing.
[ Applause ]
&gt;&gt;Sergey Brin: All right. A big round of applause for our bikers.
[ Cheers and Applause ] &gt;&gt;Sergey Brin:
I'll get a little picture of you there with my Glass.
All right. We've got -- I just wanted to -- some of our athletes who are performers I wanted to give them another big round of applause.
We have the rappellers in the back. And -- [ Applause ]
&gt;&gt;Sergey Brin: It takes a little while.
And we've got the -- let's see.
And the skydivers should be close behind them.
Thank you so much. That was amazing.
[ Applause ]
&gt;&gt;Sergey Brin:
Okay. All right. Thanks, guys.
[ Cheers and Applause ] &gt;&gt;Sergey Brin: All right. Now maybe we should -- well, all right.
Come on up, guys. You're already here. Come on up, take a bow.
[ Cheers and Applause ] &gt;&gt;Sergey Brin: These are the rappellers, all the bikers you saw up there. And there's the sky diving crew coming down the aisle.
[ Cheers and Applause ] &gt;&gt;Sergey Brin: Hey, J.T., that was amazing. We were worried about you.
That was awesome.
All right, thank you all so much.
Now maybe we should tell you a little bit about Glass.
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Sergey Brin:
All right, guys, have fun. You can meet them.
They'll be out and around if you want to chat with them.
Thank you so much.
Now, here's what -- no, no. This is the wrong one.
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Sergey Brin: I think we have to do it again.
[Laughter] &gt;&gt;&gt; I'd be happy to. &gt;&gt;Sergey Brin:
We'll find the time. We actually might have the time.
If you want to see behind the scenes and maybe catch some of that activity on -- through Hangout, tune in tomorrow.
But now I just want to tell you a bit about how we made that happen and why we're so excited about Glass, and to tell you that I have Babak and Isabelle.
[ Applause ]
CHAPTER I.
One morning, as Gregor Samsa was waking up from anxious dreams, he discovered that in bed he had been changed into a monstrous verminous bug.
He lay on his armour-hard back and saw, as he lifted his head up a little, his brown, arched abdomen divided up into rigid bow- like sections.
From this height the blanket, just about ready to slide off completely, could hardly stay in place.
His numerous legs, pitifully thin in comparison to the rest of his circumference, flickered helplessly before his eyes.
"What's happened to me," he thought.
It was no dream.
His room, a proper room for a human being, only somewhat too small, lay quietly between the four well-known walls.
Above the table, on which an unpacked collection of sample cloth goods was spread out--Samsa was a travelling salesman--hung the picture which he had cut out of an illustrated magazine a little while ago and set in a pretty gilt frame.
It was a picture of a woman with a fur hat and a fur boa.
She sat erect there, lifting up in the direction of the viewer a solid fur muff into which her entire forearm had disappeared.
Gregor's glance then turned to the window.
The dreary weather--the rain drops were falling audibly down on the metal window ledge--made him quite melancholy.
"Why don't I keep sleeping for a little while longer and forget all this foolishness," he thought.
But this was entirely impractical, for he was used to sleeping on his right side, and in his present state he couldn't get himself into this position.
No matter how hard he threw himself onto his right side, he always rolled again onto his back.
He must have tried it a hundred times, closing his eyes so that he would not have to see the wriggling legs, and gave up only when he began to feel a light, dull pain in his side which he had never felt before.
"O God," he thought, "what a demanding job I've chosen!
Day in, day out, on the road.
The stresses of selling are much greater than the work going on at head office, and, in addition to that, I have to cope with the problems of travelling, the worries about train connections, irregular bad food, temporary and constantly changing human relationships, which never come from the heart.
To hell with it all!"
He felt a slight itching on the top of his abdomen.
He slowly pushed himself on his back closer to the bed post so that he could lift his head more easily, found the itchy part, which was entirely covered with small white spots--he did not know what to make of them and wanted to feel the place with a leg.
But he retracted it immediately, for the contact felt like a cold shower all over him.
He slid back again into his earlier position.
"This getting up early," he thought, "makes a man quite idiotic.
A man must have his sleep.
Other travelling salesmen live like harem women.
For instance, when I come back to the inn during the course of the morning to write up the necessary orders, these gentlemen are just sitting down to breakfast.
If I were to try that with my boss, I'd be thrown out on the spot.
Still, who knows whether that mightn't be really good for me?
If I didn't hold back for my parents' sake, I'd have quit ages ago.
I would've gone to the boss and told him just what I think from the bottom of my heart.
He would've fallen right off his desk!
How weird it is to sit up at that desk and talk down to the employee from way up there.
The boss has trouble hearing, so the employee has to step up quite close to him.
Anyway, I haven't completely given up that hope yet.
Once I've got together the money to pay off my parents' debt to him--that should take another five or six years--I'll do it for sure.
Then I'll make the big break.
In any case, right now I have to get up.
My train leaves at five o'clock."
He looked over at the alarm clock ticking away by the chest of drawers.
"Good God!" he thought.
It was half past six, and the hands were going quietly on.
It was past the half hour, already nearly quarter to.
Could the alarm have failed to ring?
One saw from the bed that it was properly set for four o'clock.
Certainly it had rung.
Yes, but was it possible to sleep through that noise which made the furniture shake?
Now, it's true he'd not slept quietly, but evidently he'd slept all the more deeply.
Still, what should he do now?
The next train left at seven o'clock.
To catch that one, he would have to go in a mad rush.
The sample collection wasn't packed up yet, and he really didn't feel particularly fresh and active.
And even if he caught the train, there was no avoiding a blow-up with the boss, because the firm's errand boy would've waited for the five o'clock train and reported the news of his absence long ago.
He was the boss's minion, without backbone or intelligence.
Well then, what if he reported in sick?
But that would be extremely embarrassing and suspicious, because during his five years' service Gregor hadn't been sick even once.
The boss would certainly come with the doctor from the health insurance company and would reproach his parents for their lazy son and cut short all objections with the insurance doctor's comments; for him everyone was completely healthy but really lazy about work.
And besides, would the doctor in this case be totally wrong?
Apart from a really excessive drowsiness after the long sleep, Gregor in fact felt quite well and even had a really strong appetite.
As he was thinking all this over in the greatest haste, without being able to make the decision to get out of bed--the alarm clock was indicating exactly quarter to seven--there was a cautious knock on the door by the head of the bed.
"Gregor," a voice called--it was his mother!--"it's quarter to seven.
Don't you want to be on your way?"
The soft voice! Gregor was startled when he heard his voice answering.
It was clearly and unmistakably his earlier voice, but in it was intermingled, as if from below, an irrepressibly painful squeaking, which left the words positively distinct only in the first moment and distorted them in the reverberation, so that one didn't know if one had heard correctly.
Gregor wanted to answer in detail and explain everything, but in these circumstances he confined himself to saying, "Yes, yes, thank you mother.
I'm getting up right away."
Because of the wooden door the change in Gregor's voice was not really noticeable outside, so his mother calmed down with this explanation and shuffled off.
However, as a result of the short conversation, the other family members became aware that Gregor was unexpectedly still at home, and already his father was knocking on one side door, weakly but with his fist.
"Gregor, Gregor," he called out, "what's going on?"
And, after a short while, he urged him on again in a deeper voice:
"Gregor!" Gregor!" At the other side door, however, his sister knocked lightly.
"Gregor?
Are you all right?
Do you need anything?" Gregor directed answers in both directions,
"I'll be ready right away."
He made an effort with the most careful articulation and by inserting long pauses between the individual words to remove everything remarkable from his voice.
His father turned back to his breakfast.
However, the sister whispered, "Gregor, open the door--I beg you."
Gregor had no intention of opening the door, but congratulated himself on his precaution, acquired from travelling, of locking all doors during the night, even at home.
First he wanted to stand up quietly and undisturbed, get dressed, above all have breakfast, and only then consider further action, for--he noticed this clearly--by thinking things over in bed he would not reach a reasonable conclusion.
He remembered that he had already often felt a light pain or other in bed, perhaps the result of an awkward lying position, which later turned out to be purely imaginary when he stood up, and he was eager to see how his present fantasies would gradually dissipate.
That the change in his voice was nothing other than the onset of a real chill, an occupational illness of commercial travellers, of that he had not the slightest doubt.
It was very easy to throw aside the blanket.
He needed only to push himself up a little, and it fell by itself.
But to continue was difficult, particularly because he was so unusually wide.
He needed arms and hands to push himself upright.
Instead of these, however, he had only many small limbs which were incessantly moving with very different motions and which, in addition, he was unable to control.
If he wanted to bend one of them, then it was the first to extend itself, and if he finally succeeded doing what he wanted with this limb, in the meantime all the others, as if left free, moved around in an excessively painful agitation.
"But I must not stay in bed uselessly," said Gregor to himself.
At first he wanted to get out of bed with the lower part of his body, but this lower part--which, by the way, he had not yet looked at and which he also couldn't picture clearly--proved itself too difficult to move.
The attempt went so slowly.
When, having become almost frantic, he finally hurled himself forward with all his force and without thinking, he chose his direction incorrectly, and he hit the lower bedpost hard.
The violent pain he felt revealed to him that the lower part of his body was at the moment probably the most sensitive.
Thus, he tried to get his upper body out of the bed first and turned his head carefully toward the edge of the bed.
He managed to do this easily, and in spite of its width and weight his body mass at last slowly followed the turning of his head.
But as he finally raised his head outside the bed in the open air, he became anxious about moving forward any further in this manner, for if he allowed himself eventually to fall by this process, it would take a miracle to prevent his head from getting injured.
And at all costs he must not lose consciousness right now.
He preferred to remain in bed.
However, after a similar effort, while he lay there again, sighing as before, and once again saw his small limbs fighting one another, if anything worse than earlier, and didn't see any chance of imposing quiet and order on this arbitrary movement, he told himself again that he couldn't possibly remain in bed and that it might be the most reasonable thing to sacrifice everything if there was even the slightest hope of getting himself out of bed in the process.
At the same moment, however, he didn't forget to remind himself from time to time of the fact that calm--indeed the calmest-- reflection might be better than the most confused decisions.
At such moments, he directed his gaze as precisely as he could toward the window, but unfortunately there was little confident cheer to be had from a glance at the morning mist, which concealed even the other side of the narrow street.
"It's already seven o'clock," he told himself at the latest striking of the alarm clock, "already seven o'clock and still such a fog."
And for a little while longer he lay quietly with weak breathing, as if perhaps waiting for normal and natural conditions to re-emerge out of the complete stillness.
But then he said to himself, "Before it strikes a quarter past seven, whatever happens I must be completely out of bed.
Besides, by then someone from the office will arrive to inquire about me, because the office will open before seven o'clock."
And he made an effort then to rock his entire body length out of the bed with a uniform motion.
If he let himself fall out of the bed in this way, his head, which in the course of the fall he intended to lift up sharply, would probably remain uninjured.
His back seemed to be hard; nothing would really happen to that as a result of the fall.
His greatest reservation was a worry about the loud noise which the fall must create and which presumably would arouse, if not fright, then at least concern on the other side of all the doors.
However, it had to be tried.
As Gregor was in the process of lifting himself half out of bed--the new method was more of a game than an effort; he needed only to rock with a constant rhythm--it struck him how easy all this would be if someone were to come to his aid.
Two strong people--he thought of his father and the servant girl--would have been quite sufficient.
They would have only had to push their arms under his arched back to get him out of the bed, to bend down with their load, and then merely to exercise patience and care that he completed the flip onto the floor, where his diminutive legs would then, he hoped, acquire a purpose.
Now, quite apart from the fact that the doors were locked, should he really call out for help?
In spite of all his distress, he was unable to suppress a smile at this idea.
He had already got to the point where, by rocking more strongly, he maintained his equilibrium with difficulty, and very soon he would finally have to decide, for in five minutes it would be a quarter past seven.
Then there was a ring at the door of the apartment.
"That's someone from the office," he told himself, and he almost froze while his small limbs only danced around all the faster.
For one moment everything remained still.
"They aren't opening," Gregor said to himself, caught up in some absurd hope.
But of course then, as usual, the servant girl with her firm tread went to the door and opened it.
Gregor needed to hear only the first word of the visitor's greeting to recognize immediately who it was, the manager himself.
Why was Gregor the only one condemned to work in a firm where, at the slightest lapse, someone immediately attracted the greatest suspicion?
Were all the employees then collectively, one and all, scoundrels?
Among them was there then no truly devoted person who, if he failed to use just a couple of hours in the morning for office work, would become abnormal from pangs of conscience and really be in no state to get out of bed?
Was it really not enough to let an apprentice make inquiries, if such questioning was even necessary?
Must the manager himself come, and in the process must it be demonstrated to the entire innocent family that the investigation of this suspicious circumstance could be entrusted only to the intelligence of the manager?
And more as a consequence of the excited state in which this idea put Gregor than as a result of an actual decision, he swung himself with all his might out of the bed.
There was a loud thud, but not a real crash.
The fall was absorbed somewhat by the carpet and, in addition, his back was more elastic than Gregor had thought.
For that reason the dull noise was not quite so conspicuous.
But he had not held his head up with sufficient care and had hit it.
He turned his head, irritated and in pain, and rubbed it on the carpet.
"Something has fallen in there," said the manager in the next room on the left.
Gregor tried to imagine to himself whether anything similar to what was happening to him today could have also happened at some point to the manager.
At least one had to concede the possibility of such a thing.
However, as if to give a rough answer to this question, the manager now, with a squeak of his polished boots, took a few determined steps in the next room.
From the neighbouring room on the right the sister was whispering to inform Gregor:
"Gregor, the manager is here." "I know," said Gregor to himself.
But he did not dare make his voice loud enough so that his sister could hear.
"Gregor," his father now said from the neighbouring room on the left, "Mr. Manager has come and is asking why you have not left on the early train.
We don't know what we should tell him.
Besides, he also wants to speak to you personally.
He will be good enough to forgive the mess in your room."
In the middle of all this, the manager called out in a friendly way, "Good morning, Mr. Samsa."
"He is not well," said his mother to the manager, while his father was still talking at the door, "He is not well, believe me, Mr. Manager.
Otherwise how would Gregor miss a train?
The young man has nothing in his head except business.
I'm almost angry that he never goes out at night.
Right now he's been in the city eight days, but he's been at home every evening.
He sits here with us at the table and reads the newspaper quietly or studies his travel schedules.
It's a quite a diversion for him to busy himself with fretwork.
For instance, he cut out a small frame over the course of two or three evenings.
You'd be amazed how pretty it is.
It's hanging right inside the room.
You'll see it immediately, as soon as
Gregor opens the door.
Anyway, I'm happy that you're here, Mr.
Manager.
By ourselves, we would never have made Gregor open the door.
He's so stubborn, and he's certainly not well, although he denied that this morning."
"I'm coming right away," said Gregor slowly and deliberately and didn't move, so as not to lose one word of the conversation.
"My dear lady, I cannot explain it to myself in any other way," said the manager;
"I hope it is nothing serious.
On the other hand, I must also say that we business people, luckily or unluckily, however one looks at it, very often simply have to overcome a slight indisposition for business reasons."
"So can Mr. Manager come in to see you now?" asked his father impatiently and knocked once again on the door.
"No," said Gregor.
In the neighbouring room on the left a painful stillness descended.
In the neighbouring room on the right the sister began to sob.
Why didn't his sister go to the others?
She'd probably just gotten up out of bed now and hadn't even started to get dressed yet.
Then why was she crying?
Because he wasn't getting up and wasn't letting the manager in, because he was in danger of losing his position, and because then his boss would badger his parents once again with the old demands?
Those were probably unnecessary worries right now.
Gregor was still here and wasn't thinking at all about abandoning his family.
At the moment he was lying right there on the carpet, and no one who knew about his condition would've seriously demanded that he let the manager in.
But Gregor wouldn't be casually dismissed right way because of this small discourtesy, for which he would find an easy and suitable excuse later on.
It seemed to Gregor that it might be far more reasonable to leave him in peace at the moment, instead of disturbing him with crying and conversation.
But it was the very uncertainty which distressed the others and excused their behaviour.
"Mr. Samsa," the manager was now shouting, his voice raised, "what's the matter?
You are barricading yourself in your room, answer with only a yes and a no, are making serious and unnecessary troubles for your parents, and neglecting (I mention this only incidentally) your commercial duties in a truly unheard of manner.
I am speaking here in the name of your parents and your employer, and I am requesting you in all seriousness for an immediate and clear explanation.
I am amazed.
I am amazed.
I thought I knew you as a calm, reasonable person, and now you appear suddenly to want to start parading around in weird moods.
The Chief indicated to me earlier this very day a possible explanation for your neglect--it concerned the collection of cash entrusted to you a short while ago-- but in truth I almost gave him my word of honour that this explanation could not be correct.
However, now I see here your unimaginable pig headedness, and I am totally losing any desire to speak up for you in the slightest.
And your position is not at all the most secure.
Originally I intended to mention all this to you privately, but since you are letting me waste my time here uselessly, I don't know why the matter shouldn't come to the attention of your parents.
Your productivity has also been very unsatisfactory recently.
Of course, it's not the time of year to conduct exceptional business, we recognize that, but a time of year for conducting no business, there is no such thing at all,
Mr. Samsa, and such a thing must never be."
"But Mr. Manager," called Gregor, beside himself and, in his agitation, forgetting everything else, "I'm opening the door immediately, this very moment.
A slight indisposition, a dizzy spell, has prevented me from getting up.
I'm still lying in bed right now.
But I'm quite refreshed once again.
I'm in the midst of getting out of bed.
Just have patience for a short moment!
Things are not going as well as I thought.
But things are all right.
How suddenly this can overcome someone!
Only yesterday evening everything was fine with me.
My parents certainly know that. Actually just yesterday evening I had a small premonition.
People must have seen that in me.
Why have I not reported that to the office?
But people always think that they'll get over sickness without having to stay at home.
Mr. Manager!
Take it easy on my parents!
There is really no basis for the criticisms which you're now making against me, and really nobody has said a word to me about that.
Perhaps you have not read the latest orders which I shipped.
Besides, now I'm setting out on my trip on the eight o'clock train; the few hours' rest have made me stronger.
Mr. Manager, do not stay. I will be at the office in person right away.
Please have the goodness to say that and to convey my respects to the Chief."
While Gregor was quickly blurting all this out, hardly aware of what he was saying, he had moved close to the chest of drawers without effort, probably as a result of the practice he had already had in bed, and now he was trying to raise himself up on it.
Actually, he wanted to open the door.
He really wanted to let himself be seen by and to speak with the manager.
He was keen to witness what the others now asking about him would say when they saw him.
If they were startled, then Gregor had no more responsibility and could be calm.
But if they accepted everything quietly, then he would have no reason to get excited and, if he got a move on, could really be at the station around eight o'clock.
At first he slid down a few times on the smooth chest of drawers.
But at last he gave himself a final swing and stood upright there.
He was no longer at all aware of the pains in his lower body, no matter how they might still sting.
Now he let himself fall against the back of a nearby chair, on the edge of which he braced himself with his thin limbs.
By doing this he gained control over himself and kept quiet, for he could now hear the manager.
"Did you understood a single word?" the manager asked the parents, "Is he playing the fool with us?"
"For God's sake," cried the mother already in tears, "perhaps he's very ill and we're upsetting him.
Grete!
Grete!" she yelled at that point.
"Mother?" called the sister from the other side.
They were making themselves understood through Gregor's room.
"You must go to the doctor right away.
Gregor is sick.
Hurry to the doctor.
Have you heard Gregor speak yet?"
"That was an animal's voice," said the manager, remarkably quietly in comparison to the mother's cries.
"Anna!
Anna!' yelled the father through the hall into the kitchen, clapping his hands,
"fetch a locksmith right away!"
The two young women were already running through the hall with swishing skirts--how had his sister dressed herself so quickly?- -and yanked open the doors of the apartment.
One couldn't hear the doors closing at all.
They probably had left them open, as is customary in an apartment where a huge misfortune has taken place.
However, Gregor had become much calmer.
All right, people did not understand his words any more, although they seemed clear enough to him, clearer than previously, perhaps because his ears had gotten used to them.
But at least people now thought that things were not all right with him and were prepared to help him.
The confidence and assurance with which the first arrangements had been carried out made him feel good.
He felt himself included once again in the circle of humanity and was expecting from both the doctor and the locksmith, without differentiating between them with any real precision, splendid and surprising results.
In order to get as clear a voice as possible for the critical conversation which was imminent, he coughed a little, and certainly took the trouble to do this in a really subdued way, since it was possible that even this noise sounded like something different from a human cough.
He no longer trusted himself to decide any more.
Meanwhile in the next room it had become really quiet.
Perhaps his parents were sitting with the manager at the table whispering; perhaps they were all leaning against the door listening.
Gregor pushed himself slowly towards the door, with the help of the easy chair, let go of it there, threw himself against the door, held himself upright against it--the balls of his tiny limbs had a little sticky stuff on them--and rested there momentarily from his exertion.
Then he made an effort to turn the key in the lock with his mouth.
Unfortunately it seemed that he had no real teeth.
How then was he to grab hold of the key?
But to make up for that his jaws were naturally very strong; with their help he managed to get the key really moving.
He didn't notice that he was obviously inflicting some damage on himself, for a brown fluid came out of his mouth, flowed over the key, and dripped onto the floor.
"Just listen for a moment," said the manager in the next room; "he's turning the key." For Gregor that was a great encouragement.
But they all should've called out to him, including his father and mother, "Come on,
Gregor," they should've shouted; "keep going, keep working on the lock."
Imagining that all his efforts were being followed with suspense, he bit down frantically on the key with all the force he could muster.
As the key turned more, he danced around the lock.
Now he was holding himself upright only with his mouth, and he had to hang onto the key or then press it down again with the whole weight of his body, as necessary.
The quite distinct click of the lock as it finally snapped really woke Gregor up.
Breathing heavily he said to himself, "So I didn't need the locksmith," and he set his head against the door handle to open the door completely.
Because he had to open the door in this way, it was already open very wide without him yet being really visible.
He first had to turn himself slowly around the edge of the door, very carefully, of course, if he didn't want to fall awkwardly on his back right at the entrance into the room.
He was still preoccupied with this difficult movement and had no time to pay attention to anything else, when he heard the manager exclaim a loud "Oh!"--it sounded like the wind whistling--and now he saw him, nearest to the door, pressing his hand against his open mouth and moving slowly back, as if an invisible constant force was pushing him away.
His mother--in spite of the presence of the manager she was standing here with her hair sticking up on end, still a mess from the night--was looking at his father with her hands clasped.
She then went two steps towards Gregor and collapsed right in the middle of her skirts, which were spread out all around her, her face sunk on her breast, completely concealed.
His father clenched his fist with a hostile expression, as if he wished to push Gregor back into his room, then looked uncertainly around the living room, covered his eyes with his hands, and cried so that his mighty breast shook.
At this point Gregor did not take one step into the room, but leaned his body from the inside against the firmly bolted wing of the door, so that only half his body was visible, as well as his head, tilted sideways, with which he peeped over at the others.
Meanwhile it had become much brighter.
Standing out clearly from the other side of the street was a part of the endless grey- black house situated opposite--it was a hospital--with its severe regular windows breaking up the facade.
The rain was still coming down, but only in large individual drops visibly and firmly thrown down one by one onto the ground.
The breakfast dishes were standing piled around on the table, because for his father breakfast was the most important meal time in the day, which he prolonged for hours by reading various newspapers.
Directly across on the opposite wall hung a photograph of Gregor from the time of his military service; it was a picture of him as a lieutenant, as he, smiling and worry free, with his hand on his sword, demanded respect for his bearing and uniform.
The door to the hall was ajar, and since the door to the apartment was also open, one could see out into the landing of the apartment and the start of the staircase going down.
"Now," said Gregor, well aware that he was the only one who had kept his composure.
"I'll get dressed right away, pack up the collection of samples, and set off.
You'll allow me to set out on my way, will you not?
You see, Mr. Manager, I am not pig-headed, and I am happy to work.
Travelling is exhausting, but I couldn't live without it.
Where are you going, Mr. Manager?
To the office?
Really?
Will you report everything truthfully?
A person can be incapable of work momentarily, but that's precisely the best time to remember the earlier achievements and to consider that later, after the obstacles have been shoved aside, the person will work all the more eagerly and intensely.
I am really so indebted to Mr. Chief--you know that perfectly well.
On the other hand, I am concerned about my parents and my sister.
I'm in a fix, but I'll work myself out of it again.
Don't make things more difficult for me than they already are.
Speak up on my behalf in the office!
People don't like travelling salesmen.
I know that.
People think they earn pots of money and thus lead a fine life.
People don't even have any special reason to think through this judgment more clearly.
But you, Mr. Manager, you have a better perspective on what's involved than other people, even, I tell you in total confidence, a better perspective than Mr.
Chairman himself, who in his capacity as the employer may let his judgment make casual mistakes at the expense of an employee.
You also know well enough that the travelling salesman who is outside the office almost the entire year can become so easily a victim of gossip, coincidences, and groundless complaints, against which it's impossible for him to defend himself, since for the most part he doesn't hear about them at all and only then when he's exhausted after finishing a trip and at home gets to feel in his own body the nasty consequences, which can't be thoroughly explored back to their origins.
Mr. Manager, don't leave without speaking a word telling me that you'll at least concede that I'm a little in the right!"
But at Gregor's first words the manager had already turned away, and now he looked back at Gregor over his twitching shoulders with pursed lips.
During Gregor's speech he was not still for a moment but kept moving away towards the door, without taking his eyes off Gregor, but really gradually, as if there was a secret ban on leaving the room.
He was already in the hall, and given the sudden movement with which he finally pulled his foot out of the living room, one could have believed that he had just burned the sole of his foot.
In the hall, however, he stretched his right hand out away from his body towards the staircase, as if some truly supernatural relief was waiting for him there.
Gregor realized that he must not under any circumstances allow the manager to go away in this frame of mind, especially if his position in the firm was not to be placed in the greatest danger.
His parents did not understand all this very well.
Over the long years, they had developed the conviction that Gregor was set up for life in his firm and, in addition, they had so much to do nowadays with their present troubles that all foresight was foreign to them.
But Gregor had this foresight.
The manager must be held back, calmed down, convinced, and finally won over.
The future of Gregor and his family really depended on it!
If only the sister had been there!
She was clever.
She had already cried while Gregor was still lying quietly on his back.
And the manager, this friend of the ladies, would certainly let himself be guided by her.
She would have closed the door to the apartment and talked him out of his fright in the hall.
But the sister was not even there.
Gregor must deal with it himself.
Without thinking that as yet he didn't know anything about his present ability to move and that his speech possibly--indeed probably--had once again not been understood, he left the wing of the door, pushed himself through the opening, and wanted to go over to the manager, who was already holding tight onto the handrail with both hands on the landing in a ridiculous way.
But as he looked for something to hold onto, with a small scream Gregor immediately fell down onto his numerous little legs.
Scarcely had this happened, when he felt for the first time that morning a general physical well being.
The small limbs had firm floor under them; they obeyed perfectly, as he noticed to his joy, and strove to carry him forward in the direction he wanted.
Right away he believed that the final amelioration of all his suffering was immediately at hand.
But at the very moment when he lay on the floor rocking in a restrained manner quite close and directly across from his mother, who had apparently totally sunk into herself, she suddenly sprang right up with her arms spread far apart and her fingers extended and cried out, "Help, for God's sake, help!"
She held her head bowed down, as if she wanted to view Gregor better, but ran senselessly back, contradicting that gesture, forgetting that behind her stood the table with all the dishes on it.
When she reached the table, she sat down heavily on it, as if absent-mindedly, and did not appear to notice at all that next to her coffee was pouring out onto the carpet in a full stream from the large overturned container.
"Mother, mother," said Gregor quietly, and looked over towards her.
The manager momentarily had disappeared completely from his mind.
At the sight of the flowing coffee Gregor couldn't stop himself snapping his jaws in the air a few times .
At that his mother screamed all over again, hurried from the table, and collapsed into the arms of his father, who was rushing towards her.
But Gregor had no time right now for his parents--the manager was already on the staircase.
His chin level with the banister, the manager looked back for the last time.
Gregor took an initial movement to catch up to him if possible.
But the manager must have suspected something, because he made a leap down over a few stairs and disappeared, still shouting "Huh!"
The sound echoed throughout the entire stairwell.
Now, unfortunately this flight of the manager also seemed to bewilder his father completely.
Earlier he had been relatively calm, for instead of running after the manager himself or at least not hindering Gregor from his pursuit, with his right hand he grabbed hold of the manager's cane, which he had left behind with his hat and overcoat on a chair.
With his left hand, his father picked up a large newspaper from the table and, stamping his feet on the floor, he set out to drive Gregor back into his room by waving the cane and the newspaper.
No request of Gregor's was of any use; no request would even be understood.
No matter how willing he was to turn his head respectfully, his father just stomped all the harder with his feet.
Across the room from him his mother had pulled open a window, in spite of the cool weather, and leaning out with her hands on her cheeks, she pushed her face far outside the window.
Between the alley and the stairwell a strong draught came up, the curtains on the window flew around, the newspapers on the table swished, and individual sheets fluttered down over the floor.
The father relentlessly pressed forward, pushing out sibilants, like a wild man.
Now, Gregor had no practice at all in going backwards--it was really very slow going.
If Gregor only had been allowed to turn himself around, he would have been in his room right away, but he was afraid to make his father impatient by the time-consuming process of turning around, and each moment he faced the threat of a mortal blow on his back or his head from the cane in his father's hand.
Finally Gregor had no other option, for he noticed with horror that he did not understand yet how to maintain his direction going backwards.
And so he began, amid constantly anxious sideways glances in his father's direction, to turn himself around as quickly as possible, although in truth this was only done very slowly.
Perhaps his father noticed his good intentions, for he did not disrupt Gregor in this motion, but with the tip of the cane from a distance he even directed
Gregor's rotating movement here and there.
If only his father had not hissed so unbearably!
Because of that Gregor totally lost his head.
He was already almost totally turned around, when, always with this hissing in his ear, he just made a mistake and turned himself back a little.
But when he finally was successful in getting his head in front of the door opening, it became clear that his body was too wide to go through any further.
Naturally his father, in his present mental state, had no idea of opening the other wing of the door a bit to create a suitable passage for Gregor to get through.
His single fixed thought was that Gregor must get into his room as quickly as possible.
He would never have allowed the elaborate preparations that Gregor required to orient himself and thus perhaps get through the door.
On the contrary, as if there were no obstacle and with a peculiar noise, he now drove Gregor forwards.
Behind Gregor the sound at this point was no longer like the voice of only a single father.
Now it was really no longer a joke, and Gregor forced himself, come what might, into the door.
One side of his body was lifted up.
He lay at an angle in the door opening.
His one flank was sore with the scraping.
On the white door ugly blotches were left.
Soon he was stuck fast and would have not been able to move any more on his own.
The tiny legs on one side hung twitching in the air above, and the ones on the other side were pushed painfully into the floor.
Then his father gave him one really strong liberating push from behind, and he scurried, bleeding severely, far into the interior of his room.
The door was slammed shut with the cane, and finally it was quiet.

Bye!
There's his car, he must be here!
Who's car is this?
Oh, that's Cyril's, we made out in it last week.
Nelson!
Check upstairs, I'll look down here.
Nelson!
Nelson!
Nelson!
I need some water.
Reggie. What are you doing here?
You killed him.
You killed Nelson!
You killed my best friend!
What have you done with him?
I asked you a question!
Wood, ease up!
Wood!
(Cough) I didn't do anything with him.
He found emails on my computer to J Cub.
They were threats, I didn't write them, I swear!
Liar!
Liar!
Get off of him!
Where is he?
I don't know!
He hit me over the head with my computer
I just woke up.
Well, where's Cyril?
Cyril?
You mean my old roommate, Cyril?
Yes he owns this place.
You didn't know that?
You were roommates with J Cub AND Cyril?
(nod yes) What does that mean?
Cyril, listen to me!
You can't kill me!
Think about it!
Think of the devastating effect this will have on the Hollywood entertainment community!
You'll be reviled for killing a beloved celebrity.
A beloved celebrity?
Nelson, honestly,
I think Hollywood will survive without you.
Besides, they'll always have that fat guy from "Lost."
Oh, Hell no!
Help me!
Help me!
That's it, Nelson, get your heart rate up, all the more convincing to the coroner!
They didn't drive so they have to be on foot.
How are we gonna find him?
Wait, I know.
Nelson has a profile on Growlr.
If he has his phone on we can track him by proximity.
Brilliant.
I don't see his profile.
Oh, wait!
He took down his profile when he started dating Hot Toddy.
He did?
That's kind of sweet, isn't it?
Yeah, and it's about to get him killed!
I told him he was moving too fast!
Wait a minute, Cyril's got a profile on here.
And he's only 0.2 miles away!
Okay, let's go!
This way, this way!
Okay, it says now that he's only 0.1 mile away.
Which way do we go?
Let's go that way.
Maybe he took him to Cathedral City Boys Club.
He wants to murder him not suck his dick in the sauna.
Moron.
It's obvious.
He's going to the desert.
I'm really starting to like this guy.
Well, it's not totally obvious!
Ugh!
Ahh!
Alright, let's finish this!
Oh, by the way, Nelson, you will live on.
My next stop is Boise, Idaho.
And my next persona is Nelson, the self-deluded theatre queen.
No!
Ready for your final curtain call?
Get him Wood!
Baby, are you okay?
Are you okay?
Yeah, I'm okay.
Stop it, Cyril, you're giving me a "woody."
I'm really so sorry I didn't believe you.
I'm just glad you're safe.
I'm calling the police.
I can't get any service.
I can't believe I hit you over the head with your laptop.
I know.
It's okay
If I had seen those emails, I probably would have done the same thing, too.
Yeah, you know, I feel horrible.
I can't believe I let myself think you were guilty.
You know what? I got to be honest.
I think the reason I let myself think you were guilty is because
What's a guy like you doing with a guy like me?
Hey, come on.
Now look I think you are incredibly sexy.
And, I've been with plenty of "muscle bears" and "gym bunnies" and guys with six percent body fat or whatever
But you know what, it's just
It looks nice on the outside, but it's just covering up a big mess on the inside.
With you I get both. Beautiful inside AND out.
And, that makes me very lucky.
And, I'm smart enough to know that's the sort of thing you hang on to.
Awe.
(mouthed) He's so fucking hot.
You know I always did say they made the cutest couple.
What?
No, you didn't.
You were like, he's a...
Todd
Let me be the first to apologize on behalf of Wood, who refused to believe in you.
Look, guys, no sweat.
You were just looking out for your friend.
That makes you kings in my book.
So, now, who wants Martinis?
Me.
I do.
Yes, please.
You guys aren't checking out my ass, are you?
No. No.
I was.
Well, I was.
Listen guys, I feel like I should say something.
You don't have to say anything.
No, no, I want to.
I want to thank you for saving my life.
Well, I love you.
I'd be lost without you two.
You guys...
Don't say it!
Bear Hug!
He said it.
He said it.
Oh, God...
Okay...
I'm swallowing hair.
All right.
That was sweet.
So sweet.
It was touching.

Episode 9 .
Stop right there!
Hey!
Hey stop right there you punk! Hey! &lt;i&gt;Baek Seung Jo is running with me Oh! it doesn't seem true. &lt;i&gt; It really doesn't seem true.
Thanks to you, I get to experience situations that I never thought I would.
Sorry...
But the work out seems to have had an effect, seeing how you managed to keep up so well.
But, you knew?
That we were following you?
It would be weird if I didn't know. You're obvious.
I didn't have a choice.
When I found out you were going to watch a movie with Hae Ra...
Without knowing...
But if you happen to like Hae Ra,
That is something... I can do nothing about.
Do you want to go somewhere?
What?
I'm asking if you want to go somewhere? &lt;i&gt;It's like a dream... &lt;i&gt;Me being with Seung Jo. &lt;i&gt;With Seung Jo. It feels like I'm having a life time of happiness on this one day. I'm happy now
But, it looks like only families are here.
We are the only ones who look like a couple.
Of course.
There is a rumor that says, If a couple comes here together, they would break up in six months.
You didn't know?
What?
You didn't know? It's well known.
After all, we shouldn't care, since we are not dating.
You know what?
Let's just get out of here!
What to do?!
Wear it until your clothes dry.
It's cheap, but it's better than wearing wet clothes.
They were selling them by the road.
You don't like it?
It's the same?
Then, it's couple t-shirts?
Hamburger!
I was so hungry. &lt;i&gt;It's really good. &lt;i&gt; Better than the delicious French or Italian food. &lt;i&gt; I won't be able to eat such a delicious hamburger again. &lt;i&gt; I wish time would stop right here.
Eat!
Don't just look at it
But, why did you take my hand and run earlier?
You were with Hae Ra. . .
That's because. . . You were the one closest to me.
Thank you.
I keep causing trouble all the time.
I haven't really experienced something that was difficult for me.
But after you showed up...
I feel like I'm living in a completely different world.
I feel like I'm solving a sudden problem without an answer.
That may be an ordeal that I should get over.
Something I can't avoid, something I have to solve.
Is the ordeal...possibly me?
At first, I wondered about how to react to it and just wanted to avoid it.
But now, I won't run from it.
If the problem is not wrong, then there has to be an answer.
I'm going to approach it head on.
Huh?
You're going to face me head on?
If you don't get it then forget it.
No, I get it.
So, I am an ordeal to you and you were only trying to run away.
But you changed your mind, and now, you are with me.
Are you proposing to me?!
How could you have come to that conclusion?
I'm telling you that I don't dislike you.
Being with you isn't easy but I'm just saying I don't hate it.
Thank you.
I really thought that you hated me.
Ever since high school, I have only liked you.
I don't know anything about Sartre or Nietzsche . And I can't even cook.
And I'm not glamorous,
But still, I'll try my best.
I'll know to always try my best .
Really?
I'm looking forward to it.
What?
You getting smarter for me... I'm looking forward to it.
Okay.
Since the midterms are not that far away,
That confession...
I'll make sure of it with the test results. Okay?
Midterms?
But I hate exams.
Is there anyone who likes exams?
Then, can I get a C?
C?!
What are you talking about getting a C.
Then C+?
His words were as mischievous as always, but his smile was a little different from before. &lt;i&gt; More than the day I gave him my first love letter, more than the day we first kissed, &lt;i&gt; I think Baek Seung Jo feels closer to me.
Thank you.
You even walked me home.
It's like a perfect date.
Is it okay living here?
Since it is a guest room, it is kind of small.
But it's tolerable.
I'm only staying here for a little bit anyways.
We're staying here until the new house is built.
Will it be okay?
What?
I'm talking about Hae Ra.
She was the one you were meeting today. . .
How could you have parted that way.
Well, since she was with Kyung Su Sunbae.
Excuse me, Hae Ra.
I have something to tell you.
It's really hard for me to say, so I hope you will listen.
I know.
I am not good enough.
Pardon?
Not good enough?
Then have mine too.
I didn't mean... Foo... food is enough.
I'll continue.
I have tried my best not to think about it,
But I keep thinking of you. . .
Should I just leave?
I have a headache.
You have a headache? then, you should take some medicine for it.
Take your time, I will pay and leave now.
Hae Ra. I know that I lack a lot of things. That's why
I decided to try hard and not think of you
Recently, thoughts of you just fill my head.
That's what I wanted to say. &lt;i&gt;Brought to you by the PKer team @ www.viikii.net&lt;/i&gt;
Dad!
What?
Oh,
Did something good happen today?
Huh?
No, what good thing?
Aigoo, I wish something good happened to us.
Why? &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Did something happen?
Oh, it's not that...
I think it's going to take a long time to build the new house.
I can't get insurance on it since it's done by natural disasters.
And the company who was supposed to construct are just shrinking from their responsibility.
Then what should we do, Dad?
Ah, don't worry.
It will be resolved, but it will take some time.
Although it might be uncomfortable, plan on staying here for a while.
Yes.
I am sorry, Ha Ni!
What's there for you to be sorry about?
Don't worry about me.
I am fine.
Okay.
Welcome!
-Hello! -Hello!
Oh, you two came?
We didn't even open yet!
Sit!
Sit!
What are you doing here at this time?
Ha Ni went to school already.
We know.
We just thought about So Pal Bok Noodles all of a sudden.
Seafood noodles?
With a lot of fresh raw oyster.
I got it, i got it!
Over here! Two seafood noodles with a lot of fresh raw oyster.
Ooh!
Bong Joon Gu!
Sounds like it's your territory. Super charismatic, huh?
Right, huh?
Should I buy Ha Ni a pair of glasses?
Everyone else says I have charisma, but Ha Ni is the only one that doesn't see it.
Joon Gu, if you're too pushy, Ha Ni will just get bored.
What...what did you say?
Bong Joon Gu, you really don't know women.
Do you know why Ha Ni can't stand up against Seung Jo?
Because Seung Jo is cold.
What? Cold?
To women, if a man is far away, they want to get closer.
If they come towards us, we want to run away.
Is that true?
Yeah.
If you keep it up, she'll dislike you more and more, Bong Joon Gu.
No, no.
Chef kept talking about being sought after!
So I tried it out... But it does not really fit the personality And I can not play, For hard to reach.
Hi! Did you get home safely? Yesterday?
"Gangsters and Hae Rin" I'm glad that you got home safely. Let's go inside.
What are you doing?!" then you put your hands like this
"If you can forget me, try forgetting me." and just go in for the kiss. Hey! You have talent, it's very real.
- Really? - Wow, so if the girls say "What are you doing?" Then, slam...
"Why? What are you doing?" Slam. " Try to forget me if you can."
"What are you doing to me?" "Try to forget me if you can" You won't be able to forget it, right?
- It seems like Seung Jo doesn't know about it. - He doesn't. Oh Ha Ni even kissed Kyung Sunbae.
Hae Ra, I... It's fine. I'll just leave for today.
Sunbae! Let go. I'm going to do it!
- Wait a minute. - Hey! Put the racket down.
- Ah, no!
- Ha Ni!
Oh Ha Ni ah!
Ha Ni ah! Ah..
Oh, Ha Ni ah!
- Oh Ha Ni! - You're going to leave already? What do you mean?
Rumors have spread everywhere.
Huh?!
Are you sad?
Since the girl that was following you has left?
Seung Jo ah!
Oh, it's the main lead of the rumor.
Miss Calm Cat,
When did you become like that with Kyung sunbae?
Have you heard?
The rumor that doesn't make any sense.
I'm leaving first.
Good luck
Congratulations.
Can you stay here by yourself until your brother comes back?
Of course.
I don't know when Seung Jo is coming though.
Do you think I'm a baby?
I also.... need to spend some time alone.
Look at you.
That's right.
Alright, Eun Jo, We'll see you tomorrow.
Hurry!
Don't play too many games.
I won't.
Just leave quickly.
Let's go.
Ok
Aigoo
Alright!
Oh!
"Seung Jo ah" &lt;i&gt;I came all the way here without even realizing it. &lt;i&gt; How did I end up here? &lt;i&gt;And it wasn't that long ago when I was so happy that we had our first date.
What is that sound?
Mother!, Eun Jo ah!
Ouch!!
Eun Jo ah!
You.....Eun Jo ah!
Eun Jo ah!, Eun Jo what's wrong?
My stomach.
Your stomach hurts?
What about you mother?, Where is she?
Vaca...
Vacation?
What to do ?
Hold on!
Hello.
Baek Seung Jo!
Why are you calling from our house?
Eun Jo is...Eun Jo is in pain!
Eun Jo?
What happened to Eun Jo?
He seems very sick.
What to do?
What should I do?!
Oh Han Ni calm down.
Calm down and explain it clearly.
What happened to Eun Jo?
He said his stomach hurts.
He keeps throwing up.
Really?
It might be appendicitis.
Write down what I'm about to tell you and act accordingly.
Place him on his side so he doesn't choke on anything.
Keep his body warm.
Keep in mind how many times he threw up and then, tell the doctor.
Hold on.
Then call the ambulance.
This is 119, right? after that..
Bring him to Parang University Hospital.
He's an elementary school student.
I'll get there as soon as possible.
Oh Ha Ni..
Take care of Eun Jo.
It's a type of intestinal obstruction.
An intussusception has occurred in the affected region.
An intussusception?
It's when part of the intestine folds into another part, sort of like a collapsible telescope.
It's pretty far in so we must operate on it immediately.
Surgery?
Complications can arise due to a perforated intenstine so you need to hurry and make a decision.
But....
What to do?
It's not a serious surgery. &lt;i&gt;Oh Ha Ni, take care of Eun Jo.
I understand.
Begin the surgery.
You came?
Yes.
Eun Jo is having surgery.
I heard about it.
How did it go?
It was as I had thought.
His intestine was folded into itself.
Did the surgery end?
Yes, it went well, you don't have to worry.
A part of his intestine was folded into the bottom of it, so we opened up his stomach,
And returned it to normal.
After about a week, you won't be able to notice the cut.
-Baek Eun Jo -No Ri.
Thank you.
My parents... are coming up on an evening flight.
Uhmm..
They must have been very surprised.
The doctor complimented you.
He said your quick actions made the surgery easier.
If you hadn't told me how, I wouldn't have been able to do anything
It's a type of obstruction to the intestines.
I had no idea.
I really... had no idea that such a scary thing could happen.
I will call my dad.
He must be worried.
Oh Ha Ni!
Ah, my cellphone and my wallet... where did I leave it all?
I, really...
How old am I that I'm already...
You know..
That rumor with Kyung Soo sunbae...
He explained everything to me already.
Thank you Oh Ha Ni.
I was afraid... that I might do something wrong.
So, something might go wrong with Eun Jo.
Everything is alright now. &lt;i&gt; It's the first time that I heard.. &lt;i&gt;warm words from Baek Seung Jo. &lt;i&gt;Since my anxious feelings were all relieved... &lt;i&gt;My eyes and heart... &lt;i&gt;I cried so much they nearly melted away.
Hello!
Hi Eun Jo.
Omo!
You made it today.
The flowers smells good.
It's Oh Ha Ni again??
She doesn't even get tired and comes very often...
Baek Eun Jo.
How could you talk to your life saver like that??
That's alright.
It seems like you're not getting tested today.
Yes.
In the end, her motive for coming here is about hyung anyways.
Here you go again.
Seung Jo didn't come yet?
See, I told you.
It's all about Seung Jo.
If you keep saying that...
He'll be coming soon.
It seems that Ha Ni should come back home.
Again?
You came?
Baek Seung Jo, even if you talk like that...
Seung Jo, now that you know Ha Ni you feel great right?
Eun Jo, are you okay? &lt;i&gt;Brought to you by the PKer team @ www.viikii.net
How is Eun Jo?
We would be in big trouble if Ha Ni wasn't there.
True.
It would have been a disaster without Ha Ni.
Thank you.
Thank you, Oh Ki Dong.
It's a relief that everything is fine.
How is the building of your house coming along?
Is it doing alright?
You know, it's a major pain.
It happened because of the earthquake so the insurance won't really pay for it either.
We're still fighting over it right now.
It'll all go well, I guess.
Well, here.
What is this?
The monthly rent you paid us while you were living in our home.
This person couldn't bring herself to use it.
Why are you giving this back to me?
You shouldn't do this.
You helped us so much during that time.
I can't accept this.
Here.
Ki Dong shi, are you really going to be like that?
If you don't accept it, I'm going to be mad.
Yes.
Just as your restaurant was getting really popular..
I know that you were going to build a second floor.
And because of the new house, and Ha Ni...
I also know that you couldn't do anything.
But, still... this.
Ki Dong shi, don't be like that and... just come live with us again?
I came out because of Ha Ni.
This is better for Ha Ni.
Pardon?
For Ha Ni?
How can you not know your daughter's heart?
Actually, Ha Ni and Seung Jo... you don't know that they're trying to hide something from us do you?
Pardon?
Hide something?
Those two have even kissed!
And Seung Jo did it first.
Kiss?
Seung Jo did?
Yes.
So, Seung Jo liked Ha Ni all along.
Hello, Eun Jo!
You came again?
Go Ri, hello!
It's not Go Ri, it's No Ri!
That's right.
Hello, No Ri!
Hello.
I brought cake to give to you.
So Ri, you're going to eat too, right?
No Ri, No Ri!
I'm sorry.
I'm not that smart.
No, it's okay.
Everywhere I went, the hospital rooms were so quiet that it was no fun.
But, it's fun and nice here.
No Ri, have you been in the hospital for a long time?
Yes, about 1 year and 2 months.
So, they said I have to repeat fourth grade.
Really?
Then, I'll teach you your homework.
You're going to teach him?
Do you think that makes sense?
He's an elementary school student.
So rash.
Dummy how can you?
I can at least teach him the multiplication table.
I finished the multiplication table in 2nd grade though.
Really?
It's going to be more harmful than anything.
Let's just eat the cake.
Thank you.
Uhjjoo!
No Ri, you too!
She's recognized a dummy!
These guys...
Melong (sticking tongue out/ way of teasing)
Hey!
Baek Eun Jo!
Chef!
Are you worried about something??
Oh!
Your face has a look of concern.
Oh, are you finished?
Yes, of course!
I cleaned everything.
Good job.
Perhaps, did something happen to Ha Ni?
Huh?
Why would something happen to Ha Ni?
You can go home now.
Yes, Chef.
I'll be leaving.
Okay.
Good work today.
- Get home safely.
- Yes!
Here we go No Ri, let's check your temperature.
No Ri gets fevers very often.
He's also a patient that was in ICU for over 6 months.
So, you should have been more careful around him.
If you play around with a sick kid like this, what would happen?
I'm sorry.
Please be cautious.
I'm sorry, No Ri.
This is nothing.
I'm already used to it.
After Eun Jo got admitted, everyday is fun.
I can learn from Seung Jo hyung.
And I have laughed a lot because of Ha Ni noona.
I wasn't intending to be funny though...
Okay, let's just rest for today.
When your fever goes down, I'll teach you again.
Yes.
What is his sickness?
It seems like he has a problem with his heart.
Oh, I see.
That little kid has to get shots, take tests, and eat bitter medicine everyday.
He can't even do everything he wants to do.
There's no use in your crying.
That's right.
If it was you, you could have done something to help him.
What can I do?
You're a genius.
So if you put your mind into being a doctor, you can easily do it.
So, it would be great if you could be a doctor, so you could heal many people like No Ri.
Everyone would be grateful towards you.
How does it sound?
If you tell me to become a doctor, does that mean I have to become a doctor?
Yeah, please do it.
It's a really good idea right?
Well...
Being a doctor is best for you.
Baek Seung Jo wearing an all white lab coat...
I want to see you like that.
You're incorrigible . . .
You go to the hospital everyday?
So, everyday you're with Baek Seung Jo?
Because Mother leaves during the day, it's just us two.
If only Baek Seung Jo's little brother would be hospitalized a little longer.
Hey, what are you saying...
No?
What no
We can see everything, Oh Ha Ni!
What are you saying?
You're not allowed to fool around with the wheelchairs!
How do you read this?
How much is it?
Yes, what does it mean?
How much is this?
Correct.
Hey guys, let's eat a snack.
What is this?
Hey, what's the use in knowing that?
The No Ri that we love
Happy Birthday to you!
Happy Birthday!
No Ri, happy birthday!
Eun Jo, congratulations on being discharged.
Thank you.
Seung Jo hyung and Ha Ni noona, thank you for teaching me.
Okay.
If there's something you don't know, always call me.
You know my phone number, right?
Yes, I will.
No Ri, get healed quickly.
Yes, this kind of disease won't be a problem.
No Ri,
No Ri,
Eun Jo, I'm fine.
I'm going to get healed quickly and come over to your house.
I will definitely come over too.
Yes.
You must come.
Yes, I will definitely come.
No Ri didn't cry... and he held it in really well.
He's probably had to say goodbye to a friend that's gotten discharged first before.
Even though he's sad too.
Eun Jo, we're going.
Eun Jo!
Congratulations on your discharge from the hospital!
Ha Ni, you came back well!
Dad, what is all this?
It seemed like I didn't know how you felt... and that I was being stubborn about doing things my way.
Dad.
Up til now, the upstairs room... was really uncomfortable, wasn't it?
Seeing you cry (laugh?) at the hospital, I thought that you must be a part of this family.
Welcome Ha Ni.
(Seung Jo's) Mother.
Yeah. Welcome back, Ha Ni!
Thank you, Ahjushi.
Then what about my room?
Your room is with your brother.
No!
I don't want to give up my room again.
You need to say thank you to your noona.
No.
I just did what I had to do.
I'm tired.
Give us dinner.
You can go up now.
Ha Ni, you finished everything too?
Yes, I'll finish up the rest.
Okay, then it's a favor.
Good night.
Ha Ni.
Welcome.
Why aren't you sleeping yet?
I want to drink some water.
Eun Jo, you didn't sleep yet.
This time, you helped with a lot of things.
Thank you.
Punk.
He has some cuteness to him.
You were here.
I guess I ended up moving back in.
Just don't get in the way.
Okay.
Ah, you came?
Why are you still here and not leaving?
I was going to go after finishing this.
Go upstairs first.
Ha Ni, go up.
Ha Ni, wait.
Today, Bong Joon Gu's first piece of work was a success.
Yeah.
Ha Ni, you haven't eaten dinner yet, have you?
I knew it would be like that, so I made these.
Sit down, sit down.
Father, sit down please.
Here.
Look forward to it!
Bong Joon Gu's first piece of work!
Bong(?) Dumplings!
This is called Bong Dumplings.
Inside the dumpling there is another dumpling.
I made it after getting special permission from your father.
I'm not sure if it turned out well.
I have one for Father too.
Try it and please critique it.
I was waiting so long for you to come home.
Yeah.
But, what to do?
I already ate dinner.
Really?
You already ate?
Ah, what a waste.
Dad.
Oh.
That...
You did quite a good job on the shape.
Does it really look like that?
Father, try it once.
This is kind of embarrassing and I'm nervous.
Oh. Joon Gu.
There... um....
We decided to move back into Seung Jo's house.
It's a bit uncomfortable here, and kind of hard on my back.
And Seung Jo's family wants us too.
We just decided to do it that way.
Just know that. Okay?
Ah yes, yes.
I feel like I'm getting permission from you.
You did well.
Good Job.
Ha Ni, it is my first piece of work.
So try it at least once.
Eat it, okay?
Okay. &lt;i&gt;I feel sorry towards Joon Gu... &lt;i&gt;but I'm really happy about being able to be next to Seung Jo again. &lt;i&gt;I'm excited but nervous at the same time. &lt;i&gt;Will I be able to do a good job?
Oh. Where did it go?
I know I brought it in.
Is this yours?
Mine.
You took it didn't you?
Dummy.
It was on the ground right here.
Who would steal childish panties like those?
I only wear them once in a while.
I usually wear ones that have a lot of lace.
You don't have a body that can be considered sexy though.
Even the A Cup must be too big...
Did you stop growing after elementary school?
What did you say?
Hey.
Seeing you like that, and not thinking of anything...
Isn't that a big problem?
Is it that fun to make fun of me?
If you don't like living with me, you can just say it.
You just grumpily keep making fun of people.
I'm grumpy?
Yeah.
Why am I doing that?
When I see you I can't help but want to tease you.
But isn't the one with the problem you?
You even drop those kinds of things.
It's good that you two have gotten closer... but before marriage, it's good to be a little more careful. Since Eun Jo is here too. &lt;i&gt;Brought to you by the PKer team @ www.viikii.net
When are you going to select your major?
During my second year.
Then, when you decide what major you're going to take...
Will you be able to do it?
If a bunch of people choose the same major,
They decide using grades, and I'll have to compete in that manner...
But it seems that those circumstances are unlikely.
Well, I'm just saying...
It would be nice if you went into business.
I'm not interested in that area.
Ah, Why?
Please drop me off right over there.
Are you going into class?
Seung Jo!
Again?
Hey, when you think it's going well with him...
Why is he so fickle?!
Is he being mean again?
This time, it feels different from the last, though.
I don't know.
What- I mean, you said you even kissed.
Like this... you said you hugged too.
But, I mean, why in the world is he being like that??
I don't know if he's interested in me or not.
It's very frustrating.
Min Ah, don't you have any good ideas? To find out if he's interested in me or not.
Ah, then should we try the "yawning method?"
Yawning method?
So, now the word "concluded" is basically the same as "to finish" something.
You start it and it's over, so therefore, it's concluded.
Now, the second sentence we're going to look at
Tariffs lowered on industrial goods and services.
In this particular sentence, &lt;i&gt;Yawning is somewhat contagious.
So if you see someone yawn, you find yourself following. &lt;i&gt;Just use that. &lt;i&gt;You yawn during class. &lt;i&gt;But if Seung Jo yawns after you, &lt;i&gt;then that means he has glanced over at you. &lt;i&gt;If he's not interested, why would he look at you?
Yes!!
So, you're going to make effort to get it.
They're both advocating a deal, it means they both really want the deal.
Is my lesson really that boring guys?
It's ruined.
I haven't suffered from anything so far.
I met my parents well (saying) so I've lived comfortably. Yeah, You and Me...
I just lived off my greatness.
Since all the attention that was supposed to be pointed at the world was actually pointed towards me.
What do we do??
It seems we belong together more and more.
That's when, Oh Ha Ni came to our house.
Looking at her...
I came to realize that maybe the world has different plans for me.
And that is right, and maybe I'm wrong.
It was quite surprising
So I should experience the world more...
I think about it often, lately.
Anyways, thank you He Ra.
That I could talk to someone about this ...
It's a relief
If you can forget me, try forgetting me... if you can forget me... try forgett-
Hey, Ha Ni ah!
It's good that you came.
Come over here.
Ha Ni ah, the thing that you were talking about - the 'timing'
The timing of the kiss
I keep practicing this at home, but It seems there's a problem.
"If you can forget me, try forgetting me." this is 4.3 seconds...
During that time, what if Hae Ra leaves before then.
You'll have to do it before she leaves.
Of course, I have to do it before she leaves.
But you see, that timing doesn't really work out.
Oh, well, what if you were... stand right here for me.
EH?!
No, I don't want to
I did it for you that day, what's the need to do it again?
Please, do it for me.
I'll do it instead.
Ok, then you do it. Stand right here.
It worked well for Seung Jo.
When I put my hand like this, the head that was facing down, tilt it up .
If you can forget me...
You saw that just now, right?
The timing wasn't right
Before the conversation is over, he already came it.
It's too long, this 4.3 seconds.
Sunbae, do you want to try it holding a racquet?
When you hold a racket, you turn into a completely different person.
Confidence, and burning eyes.
Hae Ra!
Oh my god!
You startled me
Oh, what do we do
Aigoo, you even fold clothes so well.
Hey, when I did all this housework, it got so tiring, but now that I have you to talk to. It's so fun!
Its really true that a person can't live all by themselves
Yes, it's true.
Oh, Ha Ni!
Can you get the laundry from Seung Jo's room?
Tomorrow is Eun Jo's day to take his P.E. outfit.
It seems I have forgotten!
Sure, I'll be right back
You know that closet towards the inside, right?
I know
OH!
It's the couples T-shirt!
He still has it.
Room for rent
Part time job?
What are you doing in someone else's room?
You came?
She told me to bring Eun Jo's gym clothes.
Then you should have just gotten it and left.
What are you looking through?
Truthfully, I heard something from Kyung Soo Sunbae.
He said that you might even move out of this house.
Cham... anyways, he's a little weird, right?
It's true.
Huh?
I'm going to leave this house.
Why?
What do you mean why? Do I need to get your permission for that too?
That's not it....
Perhaps, is it because I came in?
Are you leaving because of me?
Anyways, it has nothing to do with you.
Don't relate everything to yourself.
What do you mean you're leaving this house?
Until now, under your supervision...
I have lived comfortably.
But I think it's now time to think about the path ahead of me.
Just once, living by myself, getting a part time job...
I want to throw myself into an absolutely unprotected world and watch over myself.
What kind of person am I?
What can I do?
Okay.
That's not a bad idea.
Aigoo, but still...
It hasn't been long since Ha Ni has come back.
Hey, Seung Jo.
It has nothing to do with her.
It's my life.
Okay.
Go try it out. &lt;i&gt; What should I do? &lt;i&gt; Seung Jo is going to move out of this house. &lt;i&gt; I came back into this house. &lt;i&gt; But this time, Seung Jo... &lt;i&gt; is going to leave. &lt;i&gt;Brought to you by the PKer team @ www.viikii.net
Where is Baek Seung Jo?
If I don't try,
We couldn't even meet like this.
It's Seung Jo. &lt;i&gt; Seung Jo, what are you doing by yourself? &lt;i&gt; In what area are you living right now?
Hey, Baek Seung Jo.
Since she doesn't have a chance, tell her to give up.
Tell her like a man.
Seung Jo!
All of a sudden...
It must be lonely living by yourself.
Well it doesn't seem all that bad since I'm with Yoon Hae Ra.
What?
Roomate?!
Did something happen?
No, I'm fine.

Oh my God, Cyril.
Thank God you're here!
Todd.
Todd was the one who poisoned J Cub.
It was him.
I just killed him.
He was just using me. Because he didn't want us to get too close to the truth.
What are you doing here?
Your friends called all worried sick about you.
I told them you were fine, but I figured I'd come and check up on you.
What?
It doesn't matter.
So, it was Todd.
You live with a guy for 2 years.
It's like you don't even know him.
Did you just say that you lived with he and J Cub?
Just for a little while.
Till they kicked me out.
J Cub didn't feel comfortable having me around anymore.
Oh my God!
It was you!
You were the one who poisoned J Cub!
The third roommate!
Don't go Nelson!
You've paid for the condo for the entire weekend.
I hope you enjoyed the timeshare.
Cause your time is running out!
Why are you talking normal?
Let's just say I had to get out of San Francisco in a hurry and I needed to reinvent myself.
What are you talking about?
In Boston I was Southern.
And in Chicago, I was Quebecois.
Why do you have to keep changing your identity?
Because I'm a serial killer!
Oh God, I knew it!
Oh God!
I thought Wood was the dumb one.
So, you finally got it all figured out now Nelson?
Yeah, I do!
Reggie told me that you didn't have a computer.
Yeah, he told me that.
So the only way you could have reached J Cub was through email.
Of course I had Todd's account.
We shared a room.
I knew his password.
And the cops never even thought to question you. Right?
They didn't even know you lived with them.
So why would they question you.
J Cub's dead.
And Todd, poor Todd.
He was avoiding them.
It all makes sense now.
You were in love with J Cub but he only had eyes for Todd.
I had it all wrong.
J Cub must have followed Todd to the bathroom.
To try to have sex with him.
But, Todd turned him down. Didn't he?
Yes.
J Cub was devastated.
And I was there to help pick up the pieces.
But no matter how hard you tried. J Cub was never gonna love you.
And if I couldn't have him. Nobody would!!
Like I told Reggie.
J Cub and I shared everything.
Even Chapstick!
And that's how I poisoned him.
Chapstick?
It was never in his Martini at all.
The poison was on the glass from J Cub's lips.
That's why you had a break into our house and retrieve it before we turned it over to the Police.
How did you find out about the glass?
I had access to Todd's email.
I know everything, dumbass!
What's that?
It stops the heart.
And with your high cholesterol and blood pressure.
Who would question it?
Doctor Harvey Rosenblatt will!
My triglyceride numbers went down 50 points at my last physical.
Maybe.
But even a normal heart would feel the stress of killing your lover in self defense.
After you find out he's a murderer.
OH!!
Let's go for a little walk!
Don't kill me.
I worked so hard to get those numbers down.
Please don't kill me.
I'll get you a role on a Disney Channel show!
Oh wait.
We don't have the code to get in.
Oh, I know.
It's 7, 9, 12.
Cyril told me in case I wanted to come visit.
How did you remember?
I'm the one with the photogenic mind.
Because it just happens to be the dick sizes of my last 3 boyfriends.
Come on!
Hurry! Do you still have 12's number?
No.
And he defriended me on Facebook.
Mom! "Danger. Undetonated bombs."
Don't give up!
He's trying to survive.
We must do something!
I'll take responsibility for this.
Prepare to operate!
It's a miracle!
Mom!
I saw your image in the flower that is blossoming sorrowfully
I love rain, yet it felt frosty today The season changed, the forest was colored,
The wind played a tune, memories gushed out Gather the pieces of the moon, decorate the dream, and sleep
Even if I sprinkle the sand of time, I cannot return to the past Those searching for the meaning of life are all travellers
I set my course on this endless journey for the place beyond the thorny path....
The artist of life who produces miracles with his godlike scalpel skills. The surgeon whom the era has yearned for.
Black Jack.
It paid off the camp out for two weeks, my dear Iriomote cat.
Prologue
The Order of Operations
It's so hot!
Doc, aren't you hot?
No. I'm fine. Your island is hot, but Nigirimote Island is hot too.
It's Iriomote Island.
Doc, are you really not hot?
No.
Uminekomaru, scheduled to depart at 9:15, will be boarding shortly. All passengers should line up in two rows. See?
Good morning.
How are you?
(Laughter)
It's been great, hasn't it? I've been blown away by the whole thing.
In fact, I'm leaving.
(Laughter)
There have been three themes running through the conference which are relevant to what I want to talk about.
One is the extraordinary evidence of human creativity in all of the presentations that we've had and in all of the people here. Just the variety of it and the range of it.
The second is that it's put us in a place where we have no idea what's going to happen, in terms of the future.
No idea how this may play out.
I have an interest in education. Actually, what I find is everybody has an interest in education.
Don't you?
I find this very interesting.
If you're at a dinner party, and you say you work in education -- Actually, you're not often at dinner parties, frankly. (Laughter)
If you work in education, you're not asked. (Laughter)
And you're never asked back, curiously.
That's strange to me.
But if you are, and you say to somebody, you know, they say, "What do you do?" and you say you work in education, you can see the blood run from their face.
They're like, "Oh my God," you know, "Why me?"
(Laughter)
"My one night out all week." (Laughter)
But if you ask about their education, they pin you to the wall.
Because it's one of those things that goes deep with people, am I right?
Like religion, and money and other things.
So I have a big interest in education, and I think we all do.
We have a huge vested interest in it, partly because it's education that's meant to take us into this future that we can't grasp.
If you think of it, children starting school this year will be retiring in 2065.
Nobody has a clue, despite all the expertise that's been on parade for the past four days, what the world will look like in five years' time.
And yet we're meant to be educating them for it.
So the unpredictability, I think, is extraordinary.
And the third part of this is that we've all agreed, nonetheless, on the really extraordinary capacities that children have -- their capacities for innovation.
I mean, Sirena last night was a marvel, wasn't she? Just seeing what she could do. And she's exceptional, but I think she's not, so to speak, exceptional in the whole of childhood.
What you have there is a person of extraordinary dedication who found a talent.
And my contention is, all kids have tremendous talents.
And we squander them, pretty ruthlessly.
So I want to talk about education and I want to talk about creativity.
My contention is that creativity now is as important in education as literacy, and we should treat it with the same status.
(Applause) Thank you.
(Applause) That was it, by the way.
Thank you very much.
(Laughter)
So, 15 minutes left. (Laughter) Well, I was born... no.
(Laughter) I heard a great story recently -- I love telling it -- of a little girl who was in a drawing lesson.
She was six, and she was at the back, drawing, and the teacher said this girl hardly ever paid attention, and in this drawing lesson, she did. The teacher was fascinated.
She went over to her, and she said, "What are you drawing?" And the girl said, "I'm drawing a picture of God."
And the teacher said, "But nobody knows what God looks like."
And the girl said, "They will, in a minute." (Laughter)
When my son was four in England --
Actually, he was four everywhere, to be honest. (Laughter) If we're being strict about it, wherever he went, he was four that year.
He was in the Nativity play.
Do you remember the story?
(Laughter)
No, it was big, it was a big story.
Mel Gibson did the sequel, you may have seen it.
We considered this to be one of the lead parts.
We had the place crammed full of agents in T-shirts:
"James Robinson IS Joseph!" (Laughter)
He didn't have to speak, but you know the bit where the three kings come in?
They come in bearing gifts, gold, frankincense and myrrh.
This really happened.
We were sitting there and I think they just went out of sequence, because we talked to the little boy afterward and we said,
"You OK with that?" And he said, "Yeah, why?
Was that wrong?"
They just switched. The three boys came in, four-year-olds with tea towels on their heads, and they put these boxes down, and the first boy said, "I bring you gold."
And the second boy said, "I bring you myrrh."
And the third boy said, "Frank sent this." (Laughter) What these things have in common is that kids will take a chance.
If they don't know, they'll have a go.
Am I right?
They're not frightened of being wrong.
I don't mean to say that being wrong is the same thing as being creative.
What we do know is, if you're not prepared to be wrong, you'll never come up with anything original -- if you're not prepared to be wrong.
And by the time they get to be adults, most kids have lost that capacity.
They have become frightened of being wrong.
And we run our companies like this.
We stigmatize mistakes.
And we're now running national education systems where mistakes are the worst thing you can make.
And the result is that we are educating people out of their creative capacities.
Picasso once said this, he said that all children are born artists.
The problem is to remain an artist as we grow up.
I believe this passionately, that we don't grow into creativity, we grow out of it.
Or rather, we get educated out of it.
So why is this?
I lived in Stratford-on-Avon until about five years ago.
In fact, we moved from Stratford to Los Angeles.
So you can imagine what a seamless transition that was.
(Laughter) Actually, we lived in a place called Snitterfield, just outside Stratford, which is where Shakespeare's father was born.
Are you struck by a new thought? I was.
You don't think of Shakespeare having a father, do you?
Do you?
Because you don't think of Shakespeare being a child, do you?
Shakespeare being seven?
I never thought of it. I mean, he was seven at some point.
He was in somebody's English class, wasn't he?
(Laughter)
How annoying would that be? (Laughter) "Must try harder."
And put the pencil down." (Laughter) "And stop speaking like that."
(Laughter) "It's confusing everybody."
(Laughter)
Anyway, we moved from Stratford to Los Angeles, and I just want to say a word about the transition.
I've got two kids; he's 21 now, my daughter's 16.
He didn't want to come to Los Angeles.
He loved it, but he had a girlfriend in England. This was the love of his life, Sarah.
He'd known her for a month.
(Laughter) Mind you, they'd had their fourth anniversary, because it's a long time when you're 16.
He was really upset on the plane, he said, "I'll never find another girl like Sarah."
And we were rather pleased about that, frankly -- (Laughter) Because she was the main reason we were leaving the country.
(Laughter)
But something strikes you when you move to America and travel around the world:
Every education system on Earth has the same hierarchy of subjects.
Every one.
Doesn't matter where you go.
You'd think it would be otherwise, but it isn't. At the top are mathematics and languages, then the humanities, and at the bottom are the arts.
Everywhere on Earth.
And in pretty much every system too, there's a hierarchy within the arts.
Art and music are normally given a higher status in schools than drama and dance.
There isn't an education system on the planet that teaches dance everyday to children the way we teach them mathematics.
Why not?
I think this is rather important.
I think math is very important, but so is dance.
Children dance all the time if they're allowed to, we all do.
We all have bodies, don't we?
Did I miss a meeting?
(Laughter) Truthfully, what happens is, as children grow up, we start to educate them progressively from the waist up.
And then we focus on their heads.
And slightly to one side. If you were to visit education, as an alien, and say "What's it for, public education?"
I think you'd have to conclude, if you look at the output, who really succeeds by this, who does everything that they should, who gets all the brownie points, who are the winners --
I think you'd have to conclude the whole purpose of public education throughout the world is to produce university professors.
Isn't it?
They're the people who come out the top.
And I used to be one, so there. (Laughter)
And I like university professors, but you know, we shouldn't hold them up as the high-water mark of all human achievement.
They're just a form of life, another form of life.
But they're rather curious, and I say this out of affection for them.
There's something curious about professors in my experience -- not all of them, but typically, they live in their heads.
They live up there, and slightly to one side.
They're disembodied, you know, in a kind of literal way.
They look upon their body as a form of transport for their heads. (Laughter) Don't they?
It's a way of getting their head to meetings. (Laughter)
If you want real evidence of out-of-body experiences, get yourself along to a residential conference of senior academics, and pop into the discotheque on the final night.
(Laughter) And there, you will see it. Grown men and women writhing uncontrollably, off the beat.
Waiting until it ends so they can go home and write a paper about it. (Laughter)
Our education system is predicated on the idea of academic ability. And there's a reason.
Around the world, there were no public systems of education, really, before the 19th century.
They all came into being to meet the needs of industrialism.
So the hierarchy is rooted on two ideas.
Number one, that the most useful subjects for work are at the top.
So you were probably steered benignly away from things at school when you were a kid, things you liked, on the grounds that you would never get a job doing that.
Is that right?
Don't do music, you're not going to be a musician; don't do art, you won't be an artist.
Benign advice -- now, profoundly mistaken.
The whole world is engulfed in a revolution.
And the second is academic ability, which has really come to dominate our view of intelligence, because the universities designed the system in their image.
If you think of it, the whole system of public education around the world is a protracted process of university entrance.
And the consequence is that many highly-talented, brilliant, creative people think they're not, because the thing they were good at at school wasn't valued, or was actually stigmatized.
And I think we can't afford to go on that way.
In the next 30 years, according to UNESCO, more people worldwide will be graduating through education than since the beginning of history.
More people, and it's the combination of all the things we've talked about -- technology and its transformation effect on work, and demography and the huge explosion in population.
Suddenly, degrees aren't worth anything.
Isn't that true? When I was a student, if you had a degree, you had a job.
If you didn't have a job, it's because you didn't want one.
And I didn't want one, frankly.
(Laughter)
But now kids with degrees are often heading home to carry on playing video games, because you need an MA where the previous job required a BA, and now you need a PhD for the other.
It's a process of academic inflation.
And it indicates the whole structure of education is shifting beneath our feet.
We need to radically rethink our view of intelligence.
We know three things about intelligence.
One, it's diverse.
We think about the world in all the ways that we experience it. We think visually, we think in sound, we think kinesthetically.
We think in abstract terms, we think in movement.
Secondly, intelligence is dynamic.
If you look at the interactions of a human brain, as we heard yesterday from a number of presentations, intelligence is wonderfully interactive.
The brain isn't divided into compartments.
In fact, creativity -- which I define as the process of having original ideas that have value -- more often than not comes about through the interaction of different disciplinary ways of seeing things.
By the way, there's a shaft of nerves that joins the two halves of the brain called the corpus callosum.
It's thicker in women.
Following off from Helen yesterday, this is probably why women are better at multi-tasking.
Because you are, aren't you?
There's a raft of research, but I know it from my personal life.
If my wife is cooking a meal at home -- which is not often, thankfully.
(Laughter) No, she's good at some things, but if she's cooking, she's dealing with people on the phone, she's talking to the kids, she's painting the ceiling, she's doing open-heart surgery over here.
If I'm cooking, the door is shut, the kids are out, the phone's on the hook, if she comes in I get annoyed.
I say, "Terry, please, I'm trying to fry an egg in here."
(Laughter)
"Give me a break."
(Laughter)
Actually, do you know that old philosophical thing, if a tree falls in a forest and nobody hears it, did it happen?
Remember that old chestnut?
I saw a great t-shirt recently, which said, "If a man speaks his mind in a forest, and no woman hears him, is he still wrong?" (Laughter)
And the third thing about intelligence is, it's distinct.
I'm doing a new book at the moment called "Epiphany," which is based on a series of interviews with people about how they discovered their talent.
I'm fascinated by how people got to be there. It's really prompted by a conversation I had with a wonderful woman who maybe most people have never heard of, Gillian Lynne.
Have you heard of her? Some have. She's a choreographer, and everybody knows her work.
She did "Cats" and "Phantom of the Opera."
Anyway, Gillian and I had lunch one day and I said,
"How did you get to be a dancer?" It was interesting. When she was at school, she was really hopeless.
And the school, in the '30s, wrote to her parents and said, "We think Gillian has a learning disorder."
She couldn't concentrate; she was fidgeting.
I think now they'd say she had ADHD. Wouldn't you? But this was the 1930s, and ADHD hadn't been invented at this point.
It wasn't an available condition.
(Laughter) People weren't aware they could have that.
(Laughter)
Anyway, she went to see this specialist. So, this oak-paneled room, and she was there with her mother, and she was led and sat on this chair at the end, and she sat on her hands for 20 minutes while this man talked to her mother about the problems Gillian was having at school.
Because she was disturbing people; her homework was always late; and so on, little kid of eight. In the end, the doctor went and sat next to Gillian, and said,
"I've listened to all these things your mother's told me, I need to speak to her privately.
We'll be back; we won't be very long," and they went and left her.
But as they went out of the room, he turned on the radio that was sitting on his desk.
And when they got out, he said to her mother, "Just stand and watch her." And the minute they left the room, she was on her feet, moving to the music.
And they watched for a few minutes and he turned to her mother and said,
"Mrs. Lynne, Gillian isn't sick; she's a dancer.
Take her to a dance school."
I said, "What happened?"
She said, "She did.
I can't tell you how wonderful it was.
We walked in this room and it was full of people like me.
People who couldn't sit still.
People who had to move to think."
Who had to move to think. They did ballet, they did tap, jazz; they did modern; they did contemporary.
She was eventually auditioned for the Royal Ballet School; she became a soloist; she had a wonderful career at the Royal Ballet.
She eventually graduated from the Royal Ballet School, founded the Gillian Lynne Dance Company, met Andrew Lloyd Webber.
She's been responsible for some of the most successful musical theater productions in history, she's given pleasure to millions, and she's a multi-millionaire. Somebody else might have put her on medication and told her to calm down.
(Applause)
What I think it comes to is this:
Al Gore spoke the other night about ecology and the revolution that was triggered by Rachel Carson.
I believe our only hope for the future is to adopt a new conception of human ecology, one in which we start to reconstitute our conception of the richness of human capacity.
Our education system has mined our minds in the way that we strip-mine the earth: for a particular commodity.
And for the future, it won't serve us.
We have to rethink the fundamental principles on which we're educating our children.
There was a wonderful quote by Jonas Salk, who said, "If all the insects were to disappear from the Earth, within 50 years all life on Earth would end.
If all human beings disappeared from the Earth, within 50 years all forms of life would flourish."
And he's right.
What TED celebrates is the gift of the human imagination.
We have to be careful now that we use this gift wisely and that we avert some of the scenarios that we've talked about.
And the only way we'll do it is by seeing our creative capacities for the richness they are and seeing our children for the hope that they are.
And our task is to educate their whole being, so they can face this future.
By the way -- we may not see this future, but they will.
And our job is to help them make something of it.

Episode 16 - Final How come you're riding a bike? Oh, you came.
Marriage license? Nothing, let's go. Yeah. &lt;i&gt;
Ha Ni . . . So by law, you're not related specifically to him? What are you talking about?
That means that I have another chance yet. oh~~ yeah yeah, no wonder, I thought that this was too easy. But is it true? Yeah.
Oh my god, Baek Seung Jo you're the macho type?! What? Still have a chance?
Oh my goodness, this girl is absolutely crazy! Didn't I say that I have someone that I like? Liar!
Ha Ni! I, had "something." Something?
Joo Ri! You came? At first, his hair was pretty long.
Ha Ni...! Follow me.
Marriage license. We can just do it then. What is this?
Marriage license.
Signatures of 2 witnesses. Well, your father-in-law and I can do that. Will it be okay?
Identification. We need Seung Jo's ID.
ID?
Does Seung Jo always carry around his ID?
Good
What are you doing?
Why are you looking at someone else's wallet?
What do you mean looking through?
Your wallet was pretty so I was just looking at it.
Ah, it's so cute!
Should I buy a couple's wallet too?
Hey, Oh Ha Ni.
Are you touching your husband's wallet already?
It's not that.
It seems like there are a couple bills missing.
Hey what are you talking about?
What do you see me as?
Aren't you gonna sleep?
I am. &lt;i&gt;Brought to you by the PKer team @ www.viikii.net
It's already been reported.
What?
That can't be.
This is the first time we've been here.
Really?!
But why is it already done?
Your husband registered it.
Mr. Baek Seung Jo.
Baek Seung Jo?
Did you know that I took it?
Did you not know what was in here?
Seung Jo.
Why do you tease her so much?
It's fun.
I live for teasing Oh Ha Ni.
She tries hard when she has a goal.
Changing into the nursing program isn't easy.
I did it on purpose so that she would set her mind to it.
But then you touch my wallet.
I'm disappointed in you.
No.
I'm gonna do it.
I'll do it!
I'll work hard.
Don't be disappointed.
Well 1,000 hand outs for the time being.
Ok.
Let's see how many lunch boxes...
Hey, but...
When will you finish all this?
The end is right in front of us so I think I'll have to pull an all-nighter.
Hey, but...
After that day, Chris hasn't shown up.
Is that so?
I was so busy I didn't know.
Ah paper cups...
Breathing techniques for the Heimlich maneuver...
Breathe into the mouth...
Ha Ni, Ha Ni.
Hello.
Really?!
Joon Gu?
Sit down.
Joon Gu is so cool!
By any chance, because the food is so good...
You're not confused are you?
That could happen.
No.
I like everything.
I like the way he looks.
I like how he's like a man.
And especially the way he talks.
It's like he's singing.
Oh I see.
I have to go to England on Christmas Eve.
But I don't want to go.
I want to be with him.
If Mr. Bong tells me not to go, I'm not going.
You like him that much?
But Mr. Bong said that he has someone he likes.
Is that true?
Who is it?
He said that?
No.
There's no such person.
Really?!
I knew it!
Then Ha Ni, help me a bit.
Tell Mr. Bong that I'm pretty.
Alright.
So Pal Bok Lunches!
Here, here, here.
Hello!
Hello, welcome to So Pal Bok.
Please go inside.
Wow, this is great Bong Joon Gu.
You had this kind of ability?
This is just for your opening.
Where did you leave Ha Ni and why are you with this girl?
Joon Gu!
Hello.
Ha Ni, you came?
Good job!
This is so that your business will unravel into greatness.
Buying this kind of present in this country...
I told her to buy it.
Oh really?
Okay good job, good job!
We actually need this.
Oh it's 3 fold!
Thanks!
Boss Bong!
Your honored guests are here so you should say something.
Chef, what would I say?
You may do it
What are you talking about?
Boss Bong has to do it.
Although there may be some that already know...
There's a book known as the Michelin Guide.
It's a book that introduces the best restaurants around the world.
Getting even 1 star in that book is the most honorable thing ever!
The restaurant becomes a worldwide landmark overnight!
At first I thought they were really jerks.
Who are they to put stars next to someone else's food?
Right?
But then the way they rate the food isn't just that it tastes good!
But it's about whether the food is always good no matter when you go.
A star is only given if the taste of the food is always great whether the chef goes through heartache or happiness.
So I too would like to receive a star with So Pal Bok Lunches!
Then the Goddess So Pal Bok in Heaven... would be so happy, right?
Thank you.
Thank you.
You're so cool, Mr. Bong.
Ah, Mr. Bong.
I have to go to England, but I don't want to go.
Tell me not to, then I won't.
What the hell are you talking about?!
Did I not tell you? ... ...
I have no one but Ha Ni.
Ha Ni?
Oh Ha Ni?
Yeah, I have no one but Ha Ni.
You're going to England?
Okay, go go go.
Go and don't come back, okay?
Bong Joon Gu.
Oh hey.
Chris!
What should I do?
Chris decided she was going to go to England.
She trusted me and told me everything.
I feel like I betrayed her.
Then why did you get involved in someone else's business?
She told me to help her.
You must like it.
For an ahjumma to have a scandal and all.
Why are you being like that!
But...
What exactly happened?
You and Bong Joon Gu.
What happened... that he's acting that way even though we got married?
Nothing happened.
It's just Joon Gu's character.
During Freshman year in high school...
Are you jealous?
Hey!
Who's jealous?
Jealous?!
Ah just leave it.
Let those two figure it out on their own.
If you keep getting involved... it might get worse.
Maybe?
Yeah.
Just leave them alone, until they figure everything out.
I guess so.
You did that too, didn't you?
What?
You too, after leaving everything alone, you found out your true feelings.
Ah,really.
I'm right, huh?
Hey, just study.
I'm right, aren't I?
You were jealous earlier weren't you?
I said I'm not!
I know you were.
Are you crazy?
Hey!
Aigoo cute.
Did you finish all the leftover dishes?
I'll get housewife's eczema like this!
Me too.
But, she's really not coming.
Who?
Chris.
Yeah.
Did she leave already?
Hey, hurry and come!
Let's hurry.
Hello!
Chris is leaving.
You heard, right?
What does that have to do with me?
Tell me honestly.
Do you not like Chris?
Well . . .
There's nothing not to like . . .
Doesn't not seeing her make you curious?
You miss her, right?
No way.
To me, you're the only one. Didn't I tell you?
I told you that you're my family.
I'm married, Joon Gu.
Now, Seung Jo is my family.
Yeah, that's right.
Ah, in that case
Then insurance!
Think of it like you took on insurance!
Whenever you're having a hard time, then look for me then!
Don't people look to insurance when they're having a hard time or in a sticky situation?
Joon Gu
Sit here.
Hurry.
All this time, Joon Gu, you . . . you've supported me with everything I have done, cheering me on and doing as I asked.
Thank you.
So this time too, just this once, just listen to me once more.
Sit here and calmly think about it.
"My heart feels this way"
"I know myself."
Don't just keep telling yourself that.
Just leave your heart to the swaying swing while looking up at the sky.
They say that then you'll really see your own feelings.
Try it.
And so?
What do you want me to do about you receiving your draft notice?
Ah, no it's not that you should do something, it's just, I don't know either.
For some reason, I thought I should tell you.
Why?
Don't tell me it's because I cried in front of you that day.
You don't think there's something special between us, right?
Oh, no!
Am I a fool?
When I knew why you were crying,
I didn't think that, so don't worry.
Then that's a relief.
I
I'm just saying this so don't feel burdened.
Ok.
When you're bored
When you really have nothing to do and you're really bored, a letter . . .
Would you write a letter to me?
I don't want to.
It's bothersome, it's not even e-mail.
Right, it's not even an email.
Where do you have the time to write it, put a stamp on it, find a mailbox?
I probably couldn't do it either.
With that time you might as well sleep!
Yes.
Yeah...
Then, I'll go.
Hae Ra
I have another favor to ask.
This is a real favor.
From now on, don't cry alone.
Back then, you cried into my shoulder.
It didn't feel very good,
like my bones were melting or something.
I'm really going now.
Be well.
If I'm really bored . . .
I'll come visit you.
Sleepy . . .
I don't know when a spot will open up, so I don't even want to do it.
No, Seung Jo is expecting me to do this.
Right, I can't disappoint Seung Jo.
S.J HEARTS H.N Happy Love
FlGHTlNG!
Come outside.
Why?
I have something to say.
Really?
I guess there are times the draft comes out this quickly too.
What a pity.
Oh really?
You're the only one sad to hear that I'm going to the army.
Even my parents were glad, because tuition is so expensive.
But I didn't come here to say that.
I wanted to thank you.
To me?
For what?
Didn't you always tell me?
You don't need to prepare special events or anything.
Just sincerely telling the truth is best.
Of course.
Did you confess?
To Hae Ra?
Why would I confess? But I did do something similar to confessing.
Did you know... Honestly, watching you I've learned a lot.
I didn't do it at all because I was afraid of failing.
Or being afraid of being rejected so I didn't confess.
I was always like that.
But watching you I began to think, who cares if I fail.
And who cares if I get rejected.
This was my way of thinking, this mindset.
I learned all of this watching you.
There are a few things I know!
In any case, thanks to you I had a fun time.
That's why this older brother of yours would like to.. give my Ha Ni a present.
Really?
Ok, give it to me.
Not that kind.
You said you wanted to get into the nursing program right?
When I go to the army, I'll open up a spot for you in the nursing program.
How could you do that Sunbae? You're not even in the nursing program.
Ha Ni
In this world our country is the only one that has a very great system known as the accompanying draft system.
Remember last time when I said I had a friend in the nursing program?
He's a man. He shares a room with me.
When I get drafted, I'll take him with me.
Really?!
He said he'll go with you?!
What's he going to do if he doesn't go? I'm taking away the room from him!
If I get rid of the room he has nowhere to go!
If I go to the army he has to go to the army too.
If I go to a secluded island, he has to go and catch tuna or something--
Sunbaenim!
So I'll make a spot somehow.
The exam.
I can't do anything with the exam! So you have to do well and get accepted!
Aah of course!
Aaaah! Assa! Thank you so much, really!
Sunbae! Thank you! Sunbaenim!
Thank you!
Are you this happy to see me go into the army?
Yes, I'm so happy.
Please cut it short.
It's already very short. Do you want to make it shorter?
Oh, okay.
I'm going to the army.
Then . . . we can't do it with this.
It's okay.
Don't worry,
I will wait for you. &lt;i&gt;Brought to you by the PKer team @ www.viikii.net
I requested a change of majors!
The exam is right away.
Yeah. There aren't many days left.
But what can I do?
The competition is intense.
Do well.
How can you go to sleep already?
What do you want?
You have to help me study!
Pick out the questions you think are going to appear on the exam.
It's your major.
What are you talking about?!
Please Mr. ESP Baek!
I beg of you.
In order to inspect the patient's nutritional status, when is the best time to inspect the patient's abdomen?
4 to 5 hours after a meal.
The 3 premises of setting up a goal in order to motivate someone?
Be detailed.
It must be achievable and yet slightly hard.
Also . . .
By yourself . . .
That's right!
It has to be set on your own.
See, you need a goal to be more motivated. I even set up a goal for you.
I have a goal!
What is it?
If I pass this time, a date on Christmas Day.
A date?
We got married without even a proper date.
And during the honeymoon, too.
If I pass, let's go on a date.
All right.
All day. Full.
Fine.
Awesome!
Shall we practice the practical skill portion?
The practical skill is giving CPR.
I read about it, but
I still haven't tried it yet.
About 100 compressions per minute.
So then,
One-Two-Three.
About this much.
Ok, I'll try it.
The Heimlich maneuver.
Uhh, check for breathing.
There's no breath.
Open the airway, mouth to mouth
Hey, what are you doing?
This is an emergency.
You're feeling it?
That's not it!
What do you mean "feeling" it?
Hurry, what's next?
Okay.
Next, chest compressions, 30 times . . .
One-two-three-four-five.
Hey!
Are you treating a sick person or a healthy person right now?
Huh?
I thought it would hurt.
Harder?
One-two. . .
Arms straight.
Four -- how is this?
Five...Six...Seven...Eight... Rest a bit.
Come here.
I have a lot to do.
This is study as well.
Ah, Eun Joo.
I wanted to ask you something.
Gosh. . . hyung!
Oh Ha Ni sister-in-law!
Next to your room there's a way before adolescence' me
So please watch yourselves
Yeah.
I'm sorry.
Here, take these to relax!
Did you say it was 2 sessions?
The first is the writing exam and the second is the interview.
What would they ask?
I'm so nervous.
No there's no need for that.
You'll do fine after eating this!
Hurry and go.
It's almost time.
Ha Ni, Fighting!
Fighting!
She could have taken the easy route, but she chooses the hardest one!
Gosh, how does he know exactly what's on it?
I really must have married an amazing man.
Min Ah, what if I really get into the nursing program like this?
Number 68, Oh Ha Ni.
Yes.
I'll get back to you later. &lt;i&gt;Interviewer&lt;/i&gt;
Hello, I'm number 68, Oh Ha Ni.
By any chance are you the snail?
So you eventually got in.
Why should we choose you?
Ah, yes, as an additional acceptee.
Oh, you got lucky.
A quick and accurate act of CPR, increases the probability of survival by 3 times.
But if it's done incorrectly the patient can die as well.
In real life someone gave CPR to someone whose heart stopped.
They did it incorrectly and eventually went to jail.
Really? It had to be done for the person to live.
- After all, murder is murder.
- Murder?!
What would you do?
If someone can live or die by me giving CPR,
I have to try, hoping they'll live.
Is that so?
Then, try it!
You have to check to see if they're conscious first!
Oh?
Are you alright?
You're not going to report it?
Someone please call 119!
Hey, are you treating a sick person or a healthy person here?
Stop.
That's enough.
The people of our country will not call it in unless you say, "YOU do it!".
Just a second ago you said "Please report it!", right?
The call probably still hasn't been made yet.
And you have to press in hard enough for it to be 4-5 centimeters deep.
But you nearly crushed them with 6-7 centimeters deep.
This patient probably is 100% dead from a broken rib piercing their lung.
If this was a real situation, you just murdered someone.
We can't choose a murderer as a nurse.
It was announced on the spot.
She said they can't pick a murderer.
Oh my goodness!
What did I say?
I told you that Oh Ha Ni sister-in-law and being a nurse just doesn't match.
That's right.
I was nervous even though it was a mannequin.
When she said the mannequin was dead, my heart dropped.
How in the world could I treat a person?
Ha Ni.
Then, what are you going to do?
I must have reached beyond my abilities, Dad.
I shouldn't have made the decision so easily.
Oh, I should hurry and pick a major.
I will go upstairs first.
It seems Ha Ni is quite upset.
Really.
She must be really ill fated with that professor.
What to do?
I guess there's no date after all!
There's nothing we can do.
I'm going crazy because I want to go on a date with Oh Ha Ni!
I can't break it because a promise is a promise.
Shouldn't just having dinner together be alright?
Really?
Hey!
What are you doing in here, doing this? A young guy like you should be playing outside.
Why should I do anything on Jesus's birthday?
That's right!
Chris is leaving today, right?
That's right, Chris said she was going to leave on Christmas Eve.
That's right.
Really, she said it was a 7:00 o'clock plane. I'm sure of it!
Aigoo!
Right about now, she should be at the airport. &lt;i&gt;Brought to you by the PKer team @ www.viiikii.net

I'm late!
Cell phone!
Motorcycles are trouble makers!
I'm sorry. Is there any way that I could get there faster?
What can I do with the traffic?
What should I do?
There's an accident.
Anyway, motorcycles cause accidents!
Is that person dead?
Are you alright, young lady?
What should we do? What should we do?
Someone do something.
You've just murdered someone!
Are you alright?
What to do?!
She seems to be unconscious!
Did anybody call the ambulance?
Someone call the ambulance!
What should we do?
No air for 5 minutes is brain damage and over 10 minutes is death.
Let her be!
If you wrongly move a hurt person and damage the spine, they can become paralyzed completely.
Did someone call the ambulance?
Someone must have.
No one called?
Ajusshi with the blue jacket.
Phone?
Call 119.
Oh, yes.
Oh. She's alive! She's alive!
That's a relief!
What kind of person is she?
Oh my god, that's such a relief.
Excuse me!
Do you have a ticket?
Did the plane going to the UK leave? Can't I just go in for a second?!
- You can't go in without a ticket. - It'll just be a minute!
Just for one minute.
What's up with you, Bong Joon Gu?
Why are you here?
Are you crazy?
Mr. Bong.
I was right. So I was right!
I saw everything.
You came here to get me, right?
You're here to tell me not to go.
I didn't come here to stop you.
I came here to see you off.
I came here late because there was traffic in the subway.
How come you're here and not inside?&lt;Br&gt; Did I get the time wrong?
No, I went inside and just came back out.
If I went in, then my heart,
I thought it would hurt so much right here.
Tonight, it's really just me.
Ha Ni went to see her husband.
Jong Gu . . . looks like he went to the airport. That rascal.
Merry Christmas!
She's all right.
You've done well.
Did you learn first aid?
I didn't learn it, I just . . .
If you didn't do it, then something big could have happened. You saved a person.
Customer,
Business hours are over.
Yeah.
Excuse me.
Yes.
It's nothing.
There was an accident on the way. If you were going to send a message, you should've sent it fast.
I was worried that something happened.
Are you okay?
Nothing big, right?
Yeah.
I thought you left.
I'm hungry.
Let's at least eat a hamburger somewhere.
Never mind.
Where would we go like this? &lt;Br&gt; We'd better go home.
It's really hard to have one date.
Even though I had told you that before.
Ha Ni is right here.
If not for Ha Ni, I wouldn't have been here right now.
Whether that is loyalty, friendship, or love, whatever it's called, Ha Ni is nailed in right here.
Do you understand?,
So what?
So... so... because of that...
I mean, I can't erase it, ever.
Are you okay with that?
I don't like it!
How can it be okay with me?
Then I can't do anything.
Then I'm going to nail it in too!,
If Ha Ni is just 1 nail, then I'm going to nail in 10, 20, 100 nails.
I'm going to nail it all over Mr. Bong's body!
Are you trying to kill me?!
With that many nails a person will die, not live!
Even 1 is this hard.
Really?
Then . . .
Oh flowers!
I'll cover you with flowers!
Because I don't like it when Mr.Bong is going through a hard time.
Kiddo, give up on the analogies.
I made a new batch of stuffed cucumber.
Why don't you come and have some of that?
Come on, let's go.
Hey, let go!
People are watching!
Hurry, hurry!
Hey, wait.
Let's go together.
Aren't cars not allowed here at night time?
Probably.
Then why did you go in?
What if we get caught?
Just don't get caught.
Isn't it exciting doing something we're not supposed to do?
As long as we don't get caught. &lt;i&gt;Brought to you by the PKer team @ www.viikii.net
Baek Seung Jo, you had this in you?
I had no idea.
That's cool.
I'm all kinds of charming you don't know about.
You're in big trouble now.
You've totally fallen for the magic that is Baek Seung Jo.
Hello? &lt;i&gt;This is a collect call. . .&lt;/i&gt;
Hae Ra, it's Kyung Soo!
Press 1, press 1! &lt;i&gt;If you would like to continue, press 1 and if not, please hang up.&lt;i&gt;
Hae Ra, thanks for accepting the call.
Making a collect call?
Ah, I'm sorry.
It's just that it's Christmas Eve.
What are you doing?
Where are you?
I'm out with my friends.
Oh my, why in the world would I think of you, Sunbae?
Really, little by little.
Do you eat well in the army?
I thought this year would be the busiest, but it's the most quiet.
I like it.
It's been awhile since I was able to spend time with you like this.
Does he not have any plans?
Why didn't he go out?
Anyway...
Merry Christmas!
You're the Sunbae now.
I still haven't met a patient.
You already saved someone.
And killed a mannequin.
Truthfully, I feel weird.
It's really different from practicing on a mannequin.
I didn't get scared.
All I could think about was having to save her.
I even forgot that I had a date with you.
I had purely wanted to get into the nursing program because of you.
It was much more amazing than what I had thought.
I'm thinking about reapplying.
I'll help you.
It's a cool Christmas.
It's Christmas year round, if I'm with you.
Merry Christmas.
Merry Christmas.
Hey, what if someone saw us?
Who's going to see us?
[Hey!]
Hey, they say the calm cats are the first to climb up the wall..
Were you always so quick to move?!
What?
What did you say?
[Hey!
Hey Oh Ha Ni...]
Here please.
Yes.
Excuse me.
Please give us three more side dishes.
Here you go.
Excuse me!
Okay.
Thank you.
Yes.
Who should I make this out to?
Lee Jin Ki (?)
Salute!
Here.
This is good.
What is it?
Who are you here for?
I'm here to visit soldier Wang Kyung Soo.
Yes.
Hey - open the gate.
Have a nice day!
Have a good visit!

Romeo and Juliet by William Shakespeare
THE PROLOGUE [Enter Chorus.]
CHORUS Two households, both alike in dignity,
In fair Verona, where we lay our scene, From ancient grudge break to new mutiny,
Where civil blood makes civil hands unclean.
From forth the fatal loins of these two foes
A pair of star-cross'd lovers take their life; Whose misadventur'd piteous overthrows
Doth with their death bury their parents' strife.
The fearful passage of their death-mark'd love,
And the continuance of their parents' rage, Which but their children's end naught could remove,
Is now the two hours' traffic of our stage; The which, if you with patient ears attend,
What here shall miss, our toil shall strive to mend.
[Exeunt.]
ACT I. Scene I. A public place.
[Enter Sampson and Gregory armed with swords and bucklers.]
SAMPSON Gregory, o' my word, we'll not carry coals.
GREGORY No, for then we should be colliers.
SAMPSON I mean, an we be in choler we'll draw.
GREGORY Ay, while you live, draw your neck out o' the collar.
SAMPSON I strike quickly, being moved.
GREGORY But thou art not quickly moved to strike.
SAMPSON A dog of the house of Montague moves me.
GREGORY To move is to stir; and to be valiant is to stand: therefore, if thou art moved, thou runn'st away.
SAMPSON A dog of that house shall move me to stand: I will take the wall of any man or maid of Montague's.
GREGORY That shows thee a weak slave; for the weakest goes to the wall.
SAMPSON True; and therefore women, being the weaker vessels, are ever thrust to the wall: therefore I will push Montague's men from the wall and thrust his maids to the wall.
GREGORY The quarrel is between our masters and us their men.
SAMPSON 'Tis all one, I will show myself a tyrant: when I have fought with the men I will be cruel with the maids, I will cut off their heads.
GREGORY The heads of the maids?
SAMPSON Ay, the heads of the maids, or their maidenheads; take it in what sense thou wilt.
GREGORY They must take it in sense that feel it.
SAMPSON Me they shall feel while I am able to stand: and 'tis known I am a pretty piece of flesh.
GREGORY 'Tis well thou art not fish; if thou hadst, thou hadst been poor-John.--Draw thy tool; Here comes two of the house of Montagues.
SAMPSON My naked weapon is out: quarrel!
I will back thee.
GREGORY How! turn thy back and run?
SAMPSON Fear me not.
GREGORY No, marry; I fear thee!
SAMPSON Let us take the law of our sides; let them begin.
GREGORY I will frown as I pass by; and let them take it as they list.
SAMPSON Nay, as they dare.
I will bite my thumb at them; which is disgrace to them if they bear it.
[Enter Abraham and Balthasar.]
ABRAHAM Do you bite your thumb at us, sir?
SAMPSON I do bite my thumb, sir.
ABRAHAM Do you bite your thumb at us, sir?
SAMPSON Is the law of our side if I say ay?
GREGORY No.
SAMPSON No, sir, I do not bite my thumb at you, sir; but I bite my thumb, sir.
GREGORY Do you quarrel, sir?
ABRAHAM Quarrel, sir! no, sir.
SAMPSON But if you do, sir, am for you: I serve as good a man as you.
ABRAHAM No better.
SAMPSON Well, sir.
GREGORY Say better; here comes one of my master's kinsmen.
SAMPSON Yes, better, sir.
ABRAHAM You lie.
SAMPSON Draw, if you be men.--Gregory, remember thy swashing blow.
[They fight.]
[Enter Benvolio.]
BENVOLlO Part, fools! put up your swords; you know not what you do.
[Beats down their swords.]
[Enter Tybalt.]
TYBALT What, art thou drawn among these heartless hinds?
Turn thee Benvolio, look upon thy death.
BENVOLlO I do but keep the peace: put up thy sword, Or manage it to part these men with me.
TYBALT What, drawn, and talk of peace!
I hate the word
As I hate hell, all Montagues, and thee:
Have at thee, coward!
[They fight.]
[Enter several of both Houses, who join the fray; then enter
Citizens with clubs.] 1 ClTIZEN Clubs, bills, and partisans! strike! beat them down! Down with the Capulets!
Down with the Montagues!
[Enter Capulet in his gown, and Lady Capulet.]
CAPULET What noise is this?--Give me my long sword, ho!
LADY CAPULET A crutch, a crutch!--Why call you for a sword?
CAPULET My sword, I say!--Old Montague is come,
And flourishes his blade in spite of me.
[Enter Montague and his Lady Montague.]
MONTAGUE Thou villain Capulet!-- Hold me not, let me go.
LADY MONTAGUE Thou shalt not stir one foot to seek a foe.
[Enter Prince, with Attendants.]
PRlNCE Rebellious subjects, enemies to peace, Profaners of this neighbour-stained steel,--
Will they not hear?--What, ho! you men, you beasts, That quench the fire of your pernicious rage
With purple fountains issuing from your veins,-- On pain of torture, from those bloody hands
Throw your mistemper'd weapons to the ground And hear the sentence of your moved prince.--
Three civil brawls, bred of an airy word, By thee, old Capulet, and Montague,
Have thrice disturb'd the quiet of our streets; And made Verona's ancient citizens
Cast by their grave beseeming ornaments, To wield old partisans, in hands as old,
Canker'd with peace, to part your canker'd hate:
If ever you disturb our streets again,
Your lives shall pay the forfeit of the peace.
For this time, all the rest depart away:--
You, Capulet, shall go along with me;-- And, Montague, come you this afternoon,
To know our farther pleasure in this case, To old Free-town, our common judgment-place.--
Once more, on pain of death, all men depart.
[Exeunt Prince and Attendants; Capulet, Lady Capulet, Tybalt,
Citizens, and Servants.]
MONTAGUE Who set this ancient quarrel new abroach?--
Speak, nephew, were you by when it began?
BENVOLlO Here were the servants of your adversary And yours, close fighting ere I did approach:
I drew to part them: in the instant came The fiery Tybalt, with his sword prepar'd;
Which, as he breath'd defiance to my ears, He swung about his head, and cut the winds,
Who, nothing hurt withal, hiss'd him in scorn:
While we were interchanging thrusts and blows,
Came more and more, and fought on part and part, Till the prince came, who parted either part.
LADY MONTAGUE O, where is Romeo?--saw you him to-day?--
Right glad I am he was not at this fray.
BENVOLlO Madam, an hour before the worshipp'd sun Peer'd forth the golden window of the east,
A troubled mind drave me to walk abroad; Where,--underneath the grove of sycamore
That westward rooteth from the city's side,-- So early walking did I see your son:
Towards him I made; but he was ware of me, And stole into the covert of the wood:
I, measuring his affections by my own,-- That most are busied when they're most alone,--
Pursu'd my humour, not pursuing his, And gladly shunn'd who gladly fled from me.
MONTAGUE Many a morning hath he there been seen,
With tears augmenting the fresh morning's dew, Adding to clouds more clouds with his deep sighs:
But all so soon as the all-cheering sun Should in the farthest east begin to draw
The shady curtains from Aurora's bed, Away from light steals home my heavy son,
And private in his chamber pens himself; Shuts up his windows, locks fair daylight out
And makes himself an artificial night:
Black and portentous must this humour prove,
Unless good counsel may the cause remove.
BENVOLlO My noble uncle, do you know the cause?
MONTAGUE I neither know it nor can learn of him.
BENVOLlO Have you importun'd him by any means?
MONTAGUE Both by myself and many other friends;
But he, his own affections' counsellor, Is to himself,--I will not say how true,--
But to himself so secret and so close, So far from sounding and discovery,
As is the bud bit with an envious worm Ere he can spread his sweet leaves to the air,
Or dedicate his beauty to the sun.
Could we but learn from whence his sorrows grow,
We would as willingly give cure as know.
BENVOLlO See, where he comes: so please you step aside; I'll know his grievance or be much denied.
MONTAGUE I would thou wert so happy by thy stay
To hear true shrift.--Come, madam, let's away, [Exeunt Montague and Lady.]
[Enter Romeo.]
BENVOLlO Good morrow, cousin.
ROMEO Is the day so young?
BENVOLlO But new struck nine.
ROMEO Ay me! sad hours seem long.
Was that my father that went hence so fast?
BENVOLlO It was.--What sadness lengthens Romeo's hours?
ROMEO Not having that which, having, makes them short.
BENVOLlO In love?
ROMEO Out,--
BENVOLlO Of love?
ROMEO Out of her favour where I am in love.
BENVOLlO Alas, that love, so gentle in his view,
Should be so tyrannous and rough in proof!
ROMEO Alas that love, whose view is muffled still,
Should, without eyes, see pathways to his will!-- Where shall we dine?--O me!--What fray was here?
Yet tell me not, for I have heard it all.
Here's much to do with hate, but more with love:--
Why, then, O brawling love!
O loving hate!
O anything, of nothing first create!
O heavy lightness! serious vanity!
Mis-shapen chaos of well-seeming forms!
Feather of lead, bright smoke, cold fire, sick health!
Still-waking sleep, that is not what it is!--
This love feel I, that feel no love in this.
Dost thou not laugh?
BENVOLlO No, coz, I rather weep.
ROMEO Good heart, at what?
BENVOLlO At thy good heart's oppression.
ROMEO Why, such is love's transgression.--
Griefs of mine own lie heavy in my breast; Which thou wilt propagate, to have it prest
With more of thine: this love that thou hast shown Doth add more grief to too much of mine own.
Love is a smoke rais'd with the fume of sighs; Being purg'd, a fire sparkling in lovers' eyes;
Being vex'd, a sea nourish'd with lovers' tears:
What is it else? a madness most discreet,
A choking gall, and a preserving sweet.-- Farewell, my coz.
[Going.]
BENVOLlO Soft!
I will go along:
An if you leave me so, you do me wrong.
ROMEO Tut!
I have lost myself; I am not here:
This is not Romeo, he's some other where.
BENVOLlO Tell me in sadness who is that you love?
ROMEO What, shall I groan and tell thee?
BENVOLlO Groan! why, no;
But sadly tell me who.
ROMEO Bid a sick man in sadness make his will,--
Ah, word ill urg'd to one that is so ill!-- In sadness, cousin, I do love a woman.
BENVOLlO I aim'd so near when I suppos'd you lov'd.
ROMEO A right good markman!--And she's fair I love.
BENVOLlO A right fair mark, fair coz, is soonest hit.
ROMEO Well, in that hit you miss: she'll not be hit
With Cupid's arrow,--she hath Dian's wit; And, in strong proof of chastity well arm'd,
From love's weak childish bow she lives unharm'd.
She will not stay the siege of loving terms
Nor bide th' encounter of assailing eyes, Nor ope her lap to saint-seducing gold:
O, she's rich in beauty; only poor That, when she dies, with beauty dies her store.
BENVOLlO Then she hath sworn that she will still live chaste?
ROMEO She hath, and in that sparing makes huge waste;
For beauty, starv'd with her severity, Cuts beauty off from all posterity.
She is too fair, too wise; wisely too fair, To merit bliss by making me despair:
She hath forsworn to love; and in that vow Do I live dead that live to tell it now.
BENVOLlO Be rul'd by me, forget to think of her.
ROMEO O, teach me how I should forget to think.
BENVOLlO By giving liberty unto thine eyes;
Examine other beauties.
ROMEO 'Tis the way To call hers, exquisite, in question more:
These happy masks that kiss fair ladies' brows, Being black, puts us in mind they hide the fair;
He that is strucken blind cannot forget The precious treasure of his eyesight lost:
Show me a mistress that is passing fair, What doth her beauty serve but as a note
Where I may read who pass'd that passing fair?
Farewell: thou canst not teach me to forget.
BENVOLlO I'll pay that doctrine, or else die in debt.
[Exeunt.]
Scene Il.
A Street.
[Enter Capulet, Paris, and Servant.]
CAPULET But Montague is bound as well as I,
In penalty alike; and 'tis not hard, I think, For men so old as we to keep the peace.
PARlS Of honourable reckoning are you both;
And pity 'tis you liv'd at odds so long.
But now, my lord, what say you to my suit?
CAPULET But saying o'er what I have said before:
My child is yet a stranger in the world, She hath not seen the change of fourteen years;
Let two more summers wither in their pride Ere we may think her ripe to be a bride.
PARlS Younger than she are happy mothers made.
CAPULET And too soon marr'd are those so early made.
The earth hath swallowed all my hopes but she,-- She is the hopeful lady of my earth:
But woo her, gentle Paris, get her heart, My will to her consent is but a part;
An she agree, within her scope of choice Lies my consent and fair according voice.
This night I hold an old accustom'd feast, Whereto I have invited many a guest,
Such as I love; and you among the store, One more, most welcome, makes my number more.
At my poor house look to behold this night Earth-treading stars that make dark heaven light:
Such comfort as do lusty young men feel When well apparell'd April on the heel
Of limping winter treads, even such delight Among fresh female buds shall you this night
Inherit at my house; hear all, all see, And like her most whose merit most shall be:
Which, among view of many, mine, being one, May stand in number, though in reckoning none.
Come, go with me.--Go, sirrah, trudge about Through fair Verona; find those persons out
Whose names are written there, [gives a paper] and to them say, My house and welcome on their pleasure stay.
[Exeunt Capulet and Paris].
SERVANT Find them out whose names are written here!
It is written that the shoemaker should meddle with his yard and the tailor with his last, the fisher with his pencil, and the painter with his nets; but I am sent to find those persons whose names are here writ, and can never find what names the writing person hath here writ.
I must to the learned:--in good time!
[Enter Benvolio and Romeo.]
BENVOLlO Tut, man, one fire burns out another's burning,
One pain is lessen'd by another's anguish; Turn giddy, and be holp by backward turning;
One desperate grief cures with another's languish:
Take thou some new infection to thy eye,
And the rank poison of the old will die.
ROMEO Your plantain-leaf is excellent for that.
BENVOLlO For what, I pray thee?
ROMEO For your broken shin.
BENVOLlO Why, Romeo, art thou mad?
ROMEO Not mad, but bound more than a madman is;
Shut up in prison, kept without my food, Whipp'd and tormented and--God-den, good fellow.
SERVANT God gi' go-den.--I pray, sir, can you read?
ROMEO Ay, mine own fortune in my misery.
SERVANT Perhaps you have learned it without book: but I pray, can you read anything you see?
ROMEO Ay, If I know the letters and the language.
SERVANT Ye say honestly: rest you merry!
ROMEO Stay, fellow; I can read.
[Reads.]
'Signior Martino and his wife and daughters;
County Anselmo and his beauteous sisters; the lady widow of Vitruvio; Signior Placentio and his lovely nieces; Mercutio and his brother Valentine; mine uncle Capulet, his wife, and daughters; my fair niece Rosaline; Livia; Signior Valentio and his cousin Tybalt; Lucio and the
[Gives back the paper]: whither should they come?
SERVANT Up.
ROMEO Whither?
SERVANT To supper; to our house.
ROMEO Whose house?
SERVANT My master's.
ROMEO Indeed I should have ask'd you that before.
SERVANT Now I'll tell you without asking: my master is the great rich Capulet; and if you be not of the house of Montagues, I pray, come and crush a cup of wine.
Rest you merry!
[Exit.]
BENVOLlO At this same ancient feast of Capulet's Sups the fair Rosaline whom thou so lov'st;
With all the admired beauties of Verona.
Go thither; and, with unattainted eye,
Compare her face with some that I shall show, And I will make thee think thy swan a crow.
ROMEO When the devout religion of mine eye
Maintains such falsehood, then turn tears to fires; And these,--who, often drown'd, could never die,--
Transparent heretics, be burnt for liars!
One fairer than my love? the all-seeing sun
Ne'er saw her match since first the world begun.
BENVOLlO Tut, you saw her fair, none else being by, Herself pois'd with herself in either eye:
But in that crystal scales let there be weigh'd Your lady's love against some other maid
That I will show you shining at this feast, And she shall scant show well that now shows best.
ROMEO I'll go along, no such sight to be shown,
But to rejoice in splendour of my own.
[Exeunt.]
Scene ill.
Room in Capulet's House.
[Enter Lady Capulet, and Nurse.]
LADY CAPULET Nurse, where's my daughter? call her forth to me.
NURSE Now, by my maidenhea,--at twelve year old,--
I bade her come.--What, lamb! what ladybird!-- God forbid!--where's this girl?--what, Juliet!
[Enter Juliet.]
JULlET How now, who calls?
NURSE Your mother.
JULlET Madam, I am here.
What is your will?
LADY CAPULET This is the matter,--Nurse, give leave awhile,
We must talk in secret: nurse, come back again; I have remember'd me, thou's hear our counsel.
Thou knowest my daughter's of a pretty age.
NURSE Faith, I can tell her age unto an hour.
LADY CAPULET She's not fourteen.
NURSE I'll lay fourteen of my teeth,--
And yet, to my teen be it spoken, I have but four,-- She is not fourteen.
How long is it now
To Lammas-tide?
LADY CAPULET A fortnight and odd days.
NURSE Even or odd, of all days in the year,
Come Lammas-eve at night shall she be fourteen.
Susan and she,--God rest all Christian souls!--
Were of an age: well, Susan is with God; She was too good for me:--but, as I said,
On Lammas-eve at night shall she be fourteen; That shall she, marry; I remember it well.
'Tis since the earthquake now eleven years; And she was wean'd,--I never shall forget it--,
Of all the days of the year, upon that day:
For I had then laid wormwood to my dug,
Sitting in the sun under the dove-house wall; My lord and you were then at Mantua:
Nay, I do bear a brain:--but, as I said, When it did taste the wormwood on the nipple
Of my dug and felt it bitter, pretty fool, To see it tetchy, and fall out with the dug!
Shake, quoth the dove-house: 'twas no need, I trow, To bid me trudge.
And since that time it is eleven years; For then she could stand alone; nay, by the rood
She could have run and waddled all about; For even the day before, she broke her brow:
And then my husband,--God be with his soul!
'A was a merry man,--took up the child:
'Yea,' quoth he, 'dost thou fall upon thy face?
Thou wilt fall backward when thou hast more wit; Wilt thou not, Jule?' and, by my holidame, The pretty wretch left crying, and said 'Ay:'
To see now how a jest shall come about!
I warrant, an I should live a thousand yeas,
I never should forget it; 'Wilt thou not, Jule?' quoth he; And, pretty fool, it stinted, and said 'Ay.'
LADY CAPULET Enough of this; I pray thee hold thy peace.
NURSE Yes, madam;--yet I cannot choose but laugh,
To think it should leave crying, and say 'Ay:' And yet, I warrant, it had upon its brow
A bump as big as a young cockerel's stone; A parlous knock; and it cried bitterly.
'Yea,' quoth my husband, 'fall'st upon thy face?
Thou wilt fall backward when thou com'st to age;
Wilt thou not, Jule?' it stinted, and said 'Ay.'
JULlET And stint thou too, I pray thee, nurse, say I.
NURSE Peace, I have done.
God mark thee to his grace!
Thou wast the prettiest babe that e'er I nurs'd:
An I might live to see thee married once, I have my wish.
LADY CAPULET Marry, that marry is the very theme
I came to talk of.--Tell me, daughter Juliet, How stands your disposition to be married?
JULlET It is an honour that I dream not of.
NURSE An honour!--were not I thine only nurse,
I would say thou hadst suck'd wisdom from thy teat.
LADY CAPULET Well, think of marriage now: younger than you,
Here in Verona, ladies of esteem, Are made already mothers: by my count
I was your mother much upon these years That you are now a maid.
Thus, then, in brief;--
The valiant Paris seeks you for his love.
NURSE A man, young lady! lady, such a man
As all the world--why he's a man of wax.
LADY CAPULET Verona's summer hath not such a flower.
NURSE Nay, he's a flower, in faith, a very flower.
LADY CAPULET What say you? can you love the gentleman?
This night you shall behold him at our feast; Read o'er the volume of young Paris' face,
And find delight writ there with beauty's pen; Examine every married lineament,
And see how one another lends content; And what obscur'd in this fair volume lies
Find written in the margent of his eyes.
This precious book of love, this unbound lover,
To beautify him, only lacks a cover: The fish lives in the sea; and 'tis much pride
For fair without the fair within to hide:
That book in many's eyes doth share the glory,
That in gold clasps locks in the golden story; So shall you share all that he doth possess,
By having him, making yourself no less.
NURSE No less! nay, bigger; women grow by men
LADY CAPULET Speak briefly, can you like of Paris' love?
JULlET I'll look to like, if looking liking move:
But no more deep will I endart mine eye
Than your consent gives strength to make it fly.
[Enter a Servant.]
SERVANT Madam, the guests are come, supper served up, you called, my young lady asked for, the nurse cursed in the pantry, and everything in extremity.
I must hence to wait; I beseech you, follow straight.
LADY CAPULET We follow thee.
[Exit Servant.]--
Juliet, the county stays.
NURSE Go, girl, seek happy nights to happy days.
[Exeunt.]
Scene IV.
A Street.
[Enter Romeo, Mercutio, Benvolio, with five or six Maskers;
Torch-bearers, and others.]
ROMEO What, shall this speech be spoke for our excuse?
Or shall we on without apology?
BENVOLlO The date is out of such prolixity:
We'll have no Cupid hoodwink'd with a scarf, Bearing a Tartar's painted bow of lath,
Scaring the ladies like a crow-keeper; Nor no without-book prologue, faintly spoke
After the prompter, for our entrance:
But, let them measure us by what they will,
We'll measure them a measure, and be gone.
ROMEO Give me a torch,--I am not for this ambling;
Being but heavy, I will bear the light.
MERCUTlO Nay, gentle Romeo, we must have you dance.
ROMEO Not I, believe me: you have dancing shoes, With nimble soles; I have a soul of lead
So stakes me to the ground I cannot move.
MERCUTlO You are a lover; borrow Cupid's wings, And soar with them above a common bound.
ROMEO I am too sore enpierced with his shaft
To soar with his light feathers; and so bound, I cannot bound a pitch above dull woe:
Under love's heavy burden do I sink.
MERCUTlO And, to sink in it, should you burden love; Too great oppression for a tender thing.
ROMEO Is love a tender thing? it is too rough,
Too rude, too boisterous; and it pricks like thorn.
MERCUTlO If love be rough with you, be rough with love;
Prick love for pricking, and you beat love down.-- Give me a case to put my visage in:
[Putting on a mask.]
A visard for a visard! what care I What curious eye doth quote deformities?
Here are the beetle-brows shall blush for me.
BENVOLlO Come, knock and enter; and no sooner in
But every man betake him to his legs.
ROMEO A torch for me: let wantons, light of heart, Tickle the senseless rushes with their heels;
For I am proverb'd with a grandsire phrase,-- I'll be a candle-holder and look on,--
The game was ne'er so fair, and I am done.
MERCUTlO Tut, dun's the mouse, the constable's own word:
If thou art dun, we'll draw thee from the mire
Of this--sir-reverence--love, wherein thou stick'st Up to the ears.--Come, we burn daylight, ho.
ROMEO Nay, that's not so.
MERCUTlO I mean, sir, in delay
We waste our lights in vain, like lamps by day.
Take our good meaning, for our judgment sits
Five times in that ere once in our five wits.
ROMEO And we mean well, in going to this mask; But 'tis no wit to go.
MERCUTlO Why, may one ask?
ROMEO I dreamt a dream to-night.
MERCUTlO And so did I.
ROMEO Well, what was yours?
MERCUTlO That dreamers often lie.
ROMEO In bed asleep, while they do dream things true.
MERCUTlO O, then, I see Queen Mab hath been with you.
She is the fairies' midwife; and she comes In shape no bigger than an agate-stone
On the fore-finger of an alderman, Drawn with a team of little atomies
Athwart men's noses as they lie asleep: Her waggon-spokes made of long spinners' legs;
The cover, of the wings of grasshoppers; The traces, of the smallest spider's web;
The collars, of the moonshine's watery beams; Her whip, of cricket's bone; the lash, of film;
Her waggoner, a small grey-coated gnat, Not half so big as a round little worm
Prick'd from the lazy finger of a maid:
Her chariot is an empty hazel-nut,
Made by the joiner squirrel or old grub, Time out o' mind the fairies' coachmakers.
And in this state she gallops night by night Through lovers' brains, and then they dream of love;
O'er courtiers' knees, that dream on court'sies straight; O'er lawyers' fingers, who straight dream on fees;
O'er ladies' lips, who straight on kisses dream,-- Which oft the angry Mab with blisters plagues,
Because their breaths with sweetmeats tainted are: Sometime she gallops o'er a courtier's nose,
And then dreams he of smelling out a suit; And sometime comes she with a tithe-pig's tail,
Tickling a parson's nose as 'a lies asleep, Then dreams he of another benefice:
Sometime she driveth o'er a soldier's neck, And then dreams he of cutting foreign throats,
Of breaches, ambuscadoes, Spanish blades, Of healths five fathom deep; and then anon
Drums in his ear, at which he starts and wakes; And, being thus frighted, swears a prayer or two,
And sleeps again.
This is that very Mab That plats the manes of horses in the night;
And bakes the elf-locks in foul sluttish hairs, Which, once untangled, much misfortune bodes:
This is the hag, when maids lie on their backs, That presses them, and learns them first to bear,
Making them women of good carriage:
This is she,--
ROMEO Peace, peace, Mercutio, peace,
Thou talk'st of nothing.
MERCUTlO True, I talk of dreams, Which are the children of an idle brain,
Begot of nothing but vain fantasy; Which is as thin of substance as the air,
And more inconstant than the wind, who wooes Even now the frozen bosom of the north,
And, being anger'd, puffs away from thence, Turning his face to the dew-dropping south.
BENVOLlO This wind you talk of blows us from ourselves:
Supper is done, and we shall come too late.
ROMEO I fear, too early: for my mind misgives
Some consequence, yet hanging in the stars, Shall bitterly begin his fearful date
With this night's revels; and expire the term Of a despised life, clos'd in my breast,
By some vile forfeit of untimely death:
But He that hath the steerage of my course
Direct my sail!--On, lusty gentlemen!
BENVOLlO Strike, drum.
[Exeunt.]
Scene V. A Hall in Capulet's House.
[Musicians waiting.
Enter Servants.] 1 SERVANT Where's Potpan, that he helps not to take away? he shift a trencher! he scrape a trencher!
2 SERVANT When good manners shall lie all in one or two men's hands, and they unwash'd too, 'tis a foul thing.
1 SERVANT Away with the join-stools, remove the court-cupboard, look to the plate:--good thou, save me a piece of marchpane; and as thou loves me, let the porter let in Susan Grindstone and Nell.--
Antony! and Potpan!
2 SERVANT Ay, boy, ready.
1 SERVANT You are looked for and called for, asked for and sought for in the great chamber.
2 SERVANT We cannot be here and there too.--Cheerly, boys; be brisk awhile, and the longer liver take all.
[They retire behind.]
[Enter Capulet, &amp;c. with the Guests the Maskers.]
CAPULET Welcome, gentlemen! ladies that have their toes
Unplagu'd with corns will have a bout with you.-- Ah ha, my mistresses! which of you all
Will now deny to dance? she that makes dainty, she, I'll swear hath corns; am I come near you now?
Welcome, gentlemen!
I have seen the day That I have worn a visard; and could tell
A whispering tale in a fair lady's ear, Such as would please;--'tis gone, 'tis gone, 'tis gone:
You are welcome, gentlemen!--Come, musicians, play.
A hall--a hall! give room! and foot it, girls.--
[Music plays, and they dance.]
More light, you knaves; and turn the tables up,
And quench the fire, the room is grown too hot.-- Ah, sirrah, this unlook'd-for sport comes well.
Nay, sit, nay, sit, good cousin Capulet; For you and I are past our dancing days;
How long is't now since last yourself and I Were in a mask?
2 CAPULET By'r Lady, thirty years.
CAPULET What, man! 'tis not so much, 'tis not so much:
'Tis since the nuptial of Lucentio, Come Pentecost as quickly as it will,
Some five-and-twenty years; and then we mask'd.
2 CAPULET 'Tis more, 'tis more: his son is elder, sir; His son is thirty.
CAPULET Will you tell me that?
His son was but a ward two years ago.
ROMEO What lady is that, which doth enrich the hand Of yonder knight?
SERVANT I know not, sir.
ROMEO O, she doth teach the torches to burn bright!
It seems she hangs upon the cheek of night Like a rich jewel in an Ethiop's ear;
Beauty too rich for use, for earth too dear!
So shows a snowy dove trooping with crows
As yonder lady o'er her fellows shows.
The measure done, I'll watch her place of stand
And, touching hers, make blessed my rude hand.
Did my heart love till now? forswear it, sight!
For I ne'er saw true beauty till this night.
TYBALT This, by his voice, should be a Montague.-- Fetch me my rapier, boy:--what, dares the slave
Come hither, cover'd with an antic face, To fleer and scorn at our solemnity?
Now, by the stock and honour of my kin, To strike him dead I hold it not a sin.
CAPULET Why, how now, kinsman! wherefore storm you so?
TYBALT Uncle, this is a Montague, our foe;
A villain, that is hither come in spite, To scorn at our solemnity this night.
CAPULET Young Romeo, is it?
TYBALT 'Tis he, that villain, Romeo.
CAPULET Content thee, gentle coz, let him alone,
He bears him like a portly gentleman; And, to say truth, Verona brags of him
To be a virtuous and well-govern'd youth: I would not for the wealth of all the town
Here in my house do him disparagement:
Therefore be patient, take no note of him,--
It is my will; the which if thou respect, Show a fair presence and put off these frowns,
An ill-beseeming semblance for a feast.
TYBALT It fits, when such a villain is a guest: I'll not endure him.
CAPULET He shall be endur'd:
What, goodman boy!--I say he shall;--go to; Am I the master here, or you? go to.
You'll not endure him!--God shall mend my soul, You'll make a mutiny among my guests!
You will set cock-a-hoop! you'll be the man!
TYBALT Why, uncle, 'tis a shame.
CAPULET Go to, go to!
You are a saucy boy.
Is't so, indeed?-- This trick may chance to scathe you,--I know what:
You must contrary me! marry, 'tis time.-- Well said, my hearts!--You are a princox; go:
Be quiet, or--More light, more light!--For shame!
I'll make you quiet.
What!--cheerly, my hearts.
TYBALT Patience perforce with wilful choler meeting
Makes my flesh tremble in their different greeting.
I will withdraw: but this intrusion shall,
Now seeming sweet, convert to bitter gall.
[Exit.]
ROMEO [To Juliet.]
If I profane with my unworthiest hand
This holy shrine, the gentle fine is this,-- My lips, two blushing pilgrims, ready stand
To smooth that rough touch with a tender kiss.
JULlET Good pilgrim, you do wrong your hand too much, Which mannerly devotion shows in this;
For saints have hands that pilgrims' hands do touch, And palm to palm is holy palmers' kiss.
ROMEO Have not saints lips, and holy palmers too?
JULlET Ay, pilgrim, lips that they must use in prayer.
ROMEO O, then, dear saint, let lips do what hands do;
They pray, grant thou, lest faith turn to despair.
JULlET Saints do not move, though grant for prayers' sake.
ROMEO Then move not while my prayer's effect I take.
Thus from my lips, by thine my sin is purg'd.
[Kissing her.]
JULlET Then have my lips the sin that they have took.
ROMEO Sin from my lips?
O trespass sweetly urg'd!
Give me my sin again.
JULlET You kiss by the book.
NURSE Madam, your mother craves a word with you.
ROMEO What is her mother?
NURSE Marry, bachelor,
Her mother is the lady of the house.
And a good lady, and a wise and virtuous:
I nurs'd her daughter that you talk'd withal; I tell you, he that can lay hold of her
Shall have the chinks.
ROMEO
Is she a Capulet?
O dear account! my life is my foe's debt.
BENVOLlO Away, be gone; the sport is at the best.
ROMEO Ay, so I fear; the more is my unrest.
CAPULET Nay, gentlemen, prepare not to be gone;
We have a trifling foolish banquet towards.-- Is it e'en so? why then, I thank you all;
I thank you, honest gentlemen; good-night.-- More torches here!--Come on then, let's to bed.
Ah, sirrah [to 2 Capulet], by my fay, it waxes late; I'll to my rest.
[Exeunt all but Juliet and Nurse.]
JULlET Come hither, nurse.
What is yond gentleman?
NURSE The son and heir of old Tiberio.
JULlET What's he that now is going out of door?
NURSE Marry, that, I think, be young Petruchio.
JULlET What's he that follows there, that would not dance?
NURSE I know not.
JULlET Go ask his name: if he be married,
My grave is like to be my wedding-bed.
NURSE
His name is Romeo, and a Montague; The only son of your great enemy.
JULlET My only love sprung from my only hate!
Too early seen unknown, and known too late!
Prodigious birth of love it is to me,
That I must love a loathed enemy.
NURSE
What's this?
What's this?
JULlET
A rhyme I learn'd even now Of one I danc'd withal.
[One calls within, 'Juliet.']
NURSE
Anon, anon!
Come, let's away; the strangers all are gone.
[Exeunt.]
[Enter Chorus.]
CHORUS Now old desire doth in his deathbed lie,
And young affection gapes to be his heir; That fair for which love groan'd for, and would die,
With tender Juliet match'd, is now not fair.
Now Romeo is belov'd, and loves again,
Alike bewitched by the charm of looks; But to his foe suppos'd he must complain,
And she steal love's sweet bait from fearful hooks:
Being held a foe, he may not have access
To breathe such vows as lovers us'd to swear; And she as much in love, her means much less
To meet her new beloved anywhere:
But passion lends them power, time means, to meet,
Tempering extremities with extreme sweet.
[Exit.] &gt;
ROMEO AND JULlET by William Shakespeare
ACT Il.
Scene I. An open place adjoining Capulet's Garden.
[Enter Romeo.]
ROMEO Can I go forward when my heart is here?
Turn back, dull earth, and find thy centre out.
[He climbs the wall and leaps down within it.]
[Enter Benvolio and Mercutio.]
BENVOLlO Romeo! my cousin Romeo!
MERCUTlO He is wise;
And, on my life, hath stol'n him home to bed.
BENVOLlO He ran this way, and leap'd this orchard wall:
Call, good Mercutio.
MERCUTlO Nay, I'll conjure too.--
Romeo! humours! madman! passion! lover!
Appear thou in the likeness of a sigh:
Speak but one rhyme, and I am satisfied; Cry but 'Ah me!' pronounce but Love and dove;
Speak to my gossip Venus one fair word, One nickname for her purblind son and heir,
Young auburn Cupid, he that shot so trim When King Cophetua lov'd the beggar-maid!--
He heareth not, he stirreth not, he moveth not; The ape is dead, and I must conjure him.--
I conjure thee by Rosaline's bright eyes, By her high forehead and her scarlet lip,
By her fine foot, straight leg, and quivering thigh, And the demesnes that there adjacent lie,
That in thy likeness thou appear to us!
BENVOLlO An if he hear thee, thou wilt anger him.
MERCUTlO This cannot anger him: 'twould anger him To raise a spirit in his mistress' circle,
Of some strange nature, letting it there stand Till she had laid it, and conjur'd it down;
That were some spite: my invocation Is fair and honest, and, in his mistress' name,
I conjure only but to raise up him.
BENVOLlO Come, he hath hid himself among these trees, To be consorted with the humorous night:
Blind is his love, and best befits the dark.
MERCUTlO If love be blind, love cannot hit the mark.
Now will he sit under a medlar tree, And wish his mistress were that kind of fruit
As maids call medlars when they laugh alone.-- Romeo, good night.--I'll to my truckle-bed;
This field-bed is too cold for me to sleep:
Come, shall we go?
BENVOLlO Go then; for 'tis in vain
To seek him here that means not to be found.
[Exeunt.]
Scene Il.
Capulet's Garden.
[Enter Romeo.]
ROMEO He jests at scars that never felt a wound.--
[Juliet appears above at a window.]
But soft! what light through yonder window breaks?
It is the east, and Juliet is the sun!-- Arise, fair sun, and kill the envious moon,
Who is already sick and pale with grief, That thou her maid art far more fair than she:
Be not her maid, since she is envious; Her vestal livery is but sick and green,
And none but fools do wear it; cast it off.-- It is my lady; O, it is my love!
O, that she knew she were!-- She speaks, yet she says nothing: what of that?
Her eye discourses, I will answer it.-- I am too bold, 'tis not to me she speaks:
Two of the fairest stars in all the heaven, Having some business, do entreat her eyes
To twinkle in their spheres till they return.
What if her eyes were there, they in her head?
The brightness of her cheek would shame those stars, As daylight doth a lamp; her eyes in heaven
Would through the airy region stream so bright That birds would sing and think it were not night.--
See how she leans her cheek upon her hand!
O that I were a glove upon that hand,
That I might touch that cheek!
JULlET Ah me!
ROMEO She speaks:--
O, speak again, bright angel! for thou art As glorious to this night, being o'er my head,
As is a winged messenger of heaven Unto the white-upturned wondering eyes
Of mortals that fall back to gaze on him When he bestrides the lazy-pacing clouds
And sails upon the bosom of the air.
JULlET O Romeo, Romeo! wherefore art thou Romeo?
Deny thy father and refuse thy name;
Or, if thou wilt not, be but sworn my love, And I'll no longer be a Capulet.
ROMEO [Aside.]
Shall I hear more, or shall I speak at this?
JULlET 'Tis but thy name that is my enemy;--
Thou art thyself, though not a Montague.
What's Montague?
It is nor hand, nor foot,
Nor arm, nor face, nor any other part Belonging to a man.
O, be some other name!
What's in a name? that which we call a rose By any other name would smell as sweet;
So Romeo would, were he not Romeo call'd, Retain that dear perfection which he owes
Without that title:--Romeo, doff thy name; And for that name, which is no part of thee,
Take all myself.
ROMEO I take thee at thy word:
Call me but love, and I'll be new baptiz'd;
Henceforth I never will be Romeo.
JULlET What man art thou that, thus bescreen'd in night, So stumblest on my counsel?
ROMEO By a name
I know not how to tell thee who I am:
My name, dear saint, is hateful to myself,
Because it is an enemy to thee.
Had I it written, I would tear the word.
JULlET My ears have yet not drunk a hundred words
Of that tongue's utterance, yet I know the sound; Art thou not Romeo, and a Montague?
ROMEO Neither, fair saint, if either thee dislike.
JULlET How cam'st thou hither, tell me, and wherefore?
The orchard walls are high and hard to climb; And the place death, considering who thou art,
If any of my kinsmen find thee here.
ROMEO With love's light wings did I o'erperch these walls; For stony limits cannot hold love out:
And what love can do, that dares love attempt; Therefore thy kinsmen are no let to me.
JULlET If they do see thee, they will murder thee.
ROMEO Alack, there lies more peril in thine eye
Than twenty of their swords: look thou but sweet, And I am proof against their enmity.
JULlET I would not for the world they saw thee here.
ROMEO I have night's cloak to hide me from their sight;
And, but thou love me, let them find me here.
My life were better ended by their hate
Than death prorogued, wanting of thy love.
JULlET By whose direction found'st thou out this place?
ROMEO By love, that first did prompt me to enquire;
He lent me counsel, and I lent him eyes.
I am no pilot; yet, wert thou as far
As that vast shore wash'd with the furthest sea, I would adventure for such merchandise.
JULlET Thou knowest the mask of night is on my face;
Else would a maiden blush bepaint my cheek For that which thou hast heard me speak to-night.
Fain would I dwell on form,fain, fain deny What I have spoke; but farewell compliment!
Dost thou love me, I know thou wilt say Ay; And I will take thy word: yet, if thou swear'st,
Thou mayst prove false; at lovers' perjuries, They say Jove laughs.
O gentle Romeo,
If thou dost love, pronounce it faithfully:
Or if thou thinkest I am too quickly won,
I'll frown, and be perverse, and say thee nay, So thou wilt woo: but else, not for the world.
In truth, fair Montague, I am too fond; And therefore thou mayst think my 'haviour light:
But trust me, gentleman, I'll prove more true Than those that have more cunning to be strange.
I should have been more strange, I must confess, But that thou overheard'st, ere I was 'ware,
My true-love passion: therefore pardon me; And not impute this yielding to light love,
Which the dark night hath so discovered.
ROMEO Lady, by yonder blessed moon I swear,
That tips with silver all these fruit-tree tops,--
JULlET O, swear not by the moon, the inconstant moon, That monthly changes in her circled orb,
Lest that thy love prove likewise variable.
ROMEO What shall I swear by?
JULlET Do not swear at all;
Or if thou wilt, swear by thy gracious self, Which is the god of my idolatry,
And I'll believe thee.
ROMEO If my heart's dear love,--
JULlET Well, do not swear: although I joy in thee,
I have no joy of this contract to-night; It is too rash, too unadvis'd, too sudden;
Too like the lightning, which doth cease to be Ere one can say It lightens.
Sweet, good night!
This bud of love, by summer's ripening breath, May prove a beauteous flower when next we meet.
Good night, good night! as sweet repose and rest Come to thy heart as that within my breast!
ROMEO O, wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied?
JULlET What satisfaction canst thou have to-night?
ROMEO The exchange of thy love's faithful vow for mine.
JULlET I gave thee mine before thou didst request it;
And yet I would it were to give again.
ROMEO Would'st thou withdraw it? for what purpose, love?
JULlET But to be frank and give it thee again.
And yet I wish but for the thing I have; My bounty is as boundless as the sea,
My love as deep; the more I give to thee, The more I have, for both are infinite.
I hear some noise within: dear love, adieu!-- [Nurse calls within.]
Anon, good nurse!--Sweet Montague, be true.
Stay but a little, I will come again.
[Exit.]
ROMEO O blessed, blessed night!
I am afeard, Being in night, all this is but a dream,
Too flattering-sweet to be substantial.
[Enter Juliet above.]
JULlET Three words, dear Romeo, and good night indeed.
If that thy bent of love be honourable, Thy purpose marriage, send me word to-morrow,
By one that I'll procure to come to thee, Where and what time thou wilt perform the rite;
And all my fortunes at thy foot I'll lay And follow thee, my lord, throughout the world.
NURSE [Within.] Madam!
JULlET I come anon.-- But if thou meanest not well,
I do beseech thee,--
NURSE [Within.] Madam!
JULlET By-and-by I come:--
To cease thy suit and leave me to my grief:
To-morrow will I send.
ROMEO So thrive my soul,--
JULlET A thousand times good night!
[Exit.]
ROMEO A thousand times the worse, to want thy light!-- Love goes toward love as schoolboys from their books;
But love from love, towards school with heavy looks.
[Retiring slowly.]
[Re-enter Juliet, above.]
JULlET Hist!
Romeo, hist!--O for a falconer's voice
To lure this tassel-gentle back again!
Bondage is hoarse and may not speak aloud;
Else would I tear the cave where Echo lies, And make her airy tongue more hoarse than mine
With repetition of my Romeo's name.
ROMEO It is my soul that calls upon my name:
How silver-sweet sound lovers' tongues by night, Like softest music to attending ears!
JULlET Romeo!
ROMEO My dear?
JULlET At what o'clock to-morrow
Shall I send to thee?
ROMEO At the hour of nine.
JULlET I will not fail: 'tis twenty years till then.
I have forgot why I did call thee back.
ROMEO Let me stand here till thou remember it.
JULlET I shall forget, to have thee still stand there,
Remembering how I love thy company.
ROMEO And I'll still stay, to have thee still forget, Forgetting any other home but this.
JULlET 'Tis almost morning; I would have thee gone:
And yet no farther than a wanton's bird; That lets it hop a little from her hand,
Like a poor prisoner in his twisted gyves, And with a silk thread plucks it back again,
So loving-jealous of his liberty.
ROMEO I would I were thy bird.
JULlET Sweet, so would I:
Yet I should kill thee with much cherishing.
Good night, good night! parting is such sweet sorrow
That I shall say good night till it be morrow.
[Exit.]
ROMEO Sleep dwell upon thine eyes, peace in thy breast!--
Would I were sleep and peace, so sweet to rest!
Hence will I to my ghostly father's cell,
His help to crave and my dear hap to tell.
[Exit.]
Scene ill.
Friar Lawrence's Cell.
[Enter Friar Lawrence with a basket.]
FRlAR The grey-ey'd morn smiles on the frowning night,
Chequering the eastern clouds with streaks of light; And flecked darkness like a drunkard reels
From forth day's path and Titan's fiery wheels:
Non, ere the sun advance his burning eye,
The day to cheer and night's dank dew to dry, I must up-fill this osier cage of ours
With baleful weeds and precious-juiced flowers.
The earth, that's nature's mother, is her tomb;
What is her burying gave, that is her womb:
And from her womb children of divers kind
We sucking on her natural bosom find; Many for many virtues excellent,
None but for some, and yet all different.
O, mickle is the powerful grace that lies
In plants, herbs, stones, and their true qualities:
For naught so vile that on the earth doth live
But to the earth some special good doth give; Nor aught so good but, strain'd from that fair use,
Revolts from true birth, stumbling on abuse: Virtue itself turns vice, being misapplied;
And vice sometimes by action dignified.
Within the infant rind of this small flower
Poison hath residence, and medicine power:
For this, being smelt, with that part cheers each part;
Being tasted, slays all senses with the heart.
Two such opposed kings encamp them still
In man as well as herbs,--grace and rude will; And where the worser is predominant,
Full soon the canker death eats up that plant.
[Enter Romeo.]
ROMEO Good morrow, father!
FRlAR Benedicite!
What early tongue so sweet saluteth me?-- Young son, it argues a distemper'd head
So soon to bid good morrow to thy bed:
Care keeps his watch in every old man's eye,
And where care lodges sleep will never lie; But where unbruised youth with unstuff'd brain
Doth couch his limbs, there golden sleep doth reign:
Therefore thy earliness doth me assure
Thou art uprous'd with some distemperature; Or if not so, then here I hit it right,--
Our Romeo hath not been in bed to-night.
ROMEO That last is true; the sweeter rest was mine.
FRlAR God pardon sin! wast thou with Rosaline?
ROMEO With Rosaline, my ghostly father? no; I have forgot that name, and that name's woe.
FRlAR That's my good son: but where hast thou been then?
ROMEO I'll tell thee ere thou ask it me again.
I have been feasting with mine enemy; Where, on a sudden, one hath wounded me
That's by me wounded.
Both our remedies Within thy help and holy physic lies;
I bear no hatred, blessed man; for, lo, My intercession likewise steads my foe.
FRlAR Be plain, good son, and homely in thy drift;
Riddling confession finds but riddling shrift.
ROMEO Then plainly know my heart's dear love is set On the fair daughter of rich Capulet:
As mine on hers, so hers is set on mine; And all combin'd, save what thou must combine
By holy marriage: when, and where, and how We met, we woo'd, and made exchange of vow,
I'll tell thee as we pass; but this I pray, That thou consent to marry us to-day.
FRlAR Holy Saint Francis! what a change is here!
Is Rosaline, that thou didst love so dear, So soon forsaken? young men's love, then, lies
Not truly in their hearts, but in their eyes.
Jesu Maria, what a deal of brine
Hath wash'd thy sallow cheeks for Rosaline!
How much salt water thrown away in waste,
To season love, that of it doth not taste!
The sun not yet thy sighs from heaven clears,
Thy old groans ring yet in mine ancient ears; Lo, here upon thy cheek the stain doth sit
Of an old tear that is not wash'd off yet:
If e'er thou wast thyself, and these woes thine,
Thou and these woes were all for Rosaline; And art thou chang'd?
Pronounce this sentence then,--
Women may fall, when there's no strength in men.
ROMEO Thou chidd'st me oft for loving Rosaline.
FRlAR For doting, not for loving, pupil mine.
ROMEO And bad'st me bury love.
FRlAR Not in a grave
To lay one in, another out to have.
ROMEO I pray thee chide not: she whom I love now Doth grace for grace and love for love allow;
The other did not so.
FRlAR O, she knew well Thy love did read by rote, that could not spell.
But come, young waverer, come go with me, In one respect I'll thy assistant be;
For this alliance may so happy prove, To turn your households' rancour to pure love.
ROMEO O, let us hence; I stand on sudden haste.
FRlAR Wisely, and slow; they stumble that run fast.
[Exeunt.]
Scene IV.
A Street.
[Enter Benvolio and Mercutio.]
MERCUTlO Where the devil should this Romeo be?--
Came he not home to-night?
BENVOLlO Not to his father's; I spoke with his man.
MERCUTlO Ah, that same pale hard-hearted wench, that Rosaline,
Torments him so that he will sure run mad.
BENVOLlO Tybalt, the kinsman to old Capulet, Hath sent a letter to his father's house.
MERCUTlO A challenge, on my life.
BENVOLlO Romeo will answer it.
MERCUTlO Any man that can write may answer a letter.
BENVOLlO Nay, he will answer the letter's master, how he dares, being dared.
MERCUTlO Alas, poor Romeo, he is already dead! stabbed with a white wench's black eye; shot through the ear with a love song; the very pin of his heart cleft with the blind bow-boy's butt-shaft: and is he a man to encounter Tybalt?
BENVOLlO Why, what is Tybalt?
MERCUTlO More than prince of cats, I can tell you.
O, he's the courageous captain of compliments.
He fights as you sing prick-song--keeps time, distance, and proportion; rests me his minim rest, one, two, and the third in your bosom: the very butcher of a silk button, a duellist, a duellist; a gentleman of the very first house,--of the first and second cause: ah, the immortal passado! the punto reverso! the hay.--
BENVOLlO The what?
MERCUTlO The pox of such antic, lisping, affecting fantasticoes; these new tuners of accents!--'By Jesu, a very good blade!--a very tall man!--a very good whore!'--Why, is not this a lamentable thing, grandsire, that we should be thus afflicted with these strange flies, these fashion-mongers, these pardonnez-moi's, who stand so much on the new form that they cannot sit at ease on the old bench?
BENVOLlO Here comes Romeo, here comes Romeo!
MERCUTlO Without his roe, like a dried herring.--O flesh, flesh, how art thou fishified!--Now is he for the numbers that Petrarch flowed in:
Laura, to his lady, was but a kitchen wench,--marry, she had a better love to be-rhyme her; Dido, a dowdy; Cleopatra, a gypsy; Helen and Hero, hildings and harlots; Thisbe, a gray eye or so, but not to the purpose,-- [Enter Romeo.]
Signior Romeo, bon jour! there's a French salutation to your French slop.
You gave us the counterfeit fairly last night.
ROMEO Good morrow to you both.
What counterfeit did I give you?
MERCUTlO The slip, sir, the slip; can you not conceive?
ROMEO Pardon, good Mercutio, my business was great; and in such a case as mine a man may strain courtesy.
MERCUTlO That's as much as to say, such a case as yours constrains a man to bow in the hams.
ROMEO Meaning, to court'sy.
MERCUTlO Thou hast most kindly hit it.
ROMEO A most courteous exposition.
MERCUTlO Nay, I am the very pink of courtesy.
ROMEO Pink for flower.
MERCUTlO Right.
ROMEO Why, then is my pump well-flowered.
MERCUTlO Well said: follow me this jest now till thou hast worn out thy pump;that, when the single sole of it is worn, the jest may remain, after the wearing, sole singular.
ROMEO O single-soled jest, solely singular for the singleness!
MERCUTlO Come between us, good Benvolio; my wits faint.
ROMEO Swits and spurs, swits and spurs; or I'll cry a match.
MERCUTlO Nay, if thy wits run the wild-goose chase, I have done; for thou hast more of the wild-goose in one of thy wits than, I am sure, I have in my whole five: was I with you there for the goose?
ROMEO Thou wast never with me for anything when thou wast not there for the goose.
MERCUTlO I will bite thee by the ear for that jest.
ROMEO Nay, good goose, bite not.
MERCUTlO Thy wit is a very bitter sweeting; it is a most sharp sauce.
ROMEO And is it not, then, well served in to a sweet goose?
MERCUTlO O, here's a wit of cheveril, that stretches from an inch narrow to an ell broad!
ROMEO I stretch it out for that word broad: which added to the goose, proves thee far and wide a broad goose.
MERCUTlO Why, is not this better now than groaning for love? now art thou sociable, now art thou Romeo; not art thou what thou art, by art as well as by nature: for this drivelling love is like a great natural, that runs lolling up and down to hide his bauble in a hole.
BENVOLlO Stop there, stop there.
MERCUTlO Thou desirest me to stop in my tale against the hair.
BENVOLlO Thou wouldst else have made thy tale large.
MERCUTlO O, thou art deceived; I would have made it short: for I was come to the whole depth of my tale; and meant indeed to occupy the argument no longer.
ROMEO Here's goodly gear!
[Enter Nurse and Peter.]
MERCUTlO A sail, a sail, a sail!
BENVOLlO Two, two; a shirt and a smock.
NURSE Peter!
PETER Anon.
NURSE My fan, Peter.
MERCUTlO Good Peter, to hide her face; for her fan's the fairer face.
NURSE God ye good morrow, gentlemen.
MERCUTlO God ye good-den, fair gentlewoman.
NURSE Is it good-den?
MERCUTlO 'Tis no less, I tell ye; for the bawdy hand of the dial is now upon the prick of noon.
NURSE Out upon you! what a man are you!
ROMEO One, gentlewoman, that God hath made for himself to mar.
NURSE By my troth, it is well said;--for himself to mar, quoth 'a?--Gentlemen, can any of you tell me where I may find the young
Romeo?
ROMEO I can tell you: but young Romeo will be older when you have found him than he was when you sought him:
I am the youngest of that name, for fault of a worse.
NURSE You say well.
MERCUTlO Yea, is the worst well? very well took, i' faith; wisely, wisely.
NURSE If you be he, sir, I desire some confidence with you.
BENVOLlO She will indite him to some supper.
MERCUTlO A bawd, a bawd, a bawd!
So ho!
ROMEO What hast thou found?
MERCUTlO No hare, sir; unless a hare, sir, in a lenten pie, that is something stale and hoar ere it be spent.
An old hare hoar, And an old hare hoar,
Is very good meat in Lent; But a hare that is hoar
Is too much for a score When it hoars ere it be spent.
Romeo, will you come to your father's? we'll to dinner thither.
ROMEO I will follow you.
MERCUTlO Farewell, ancient lady; farewell,-- [singing] lady, lady, lady.
[Exeunt Mercutio, and Benvolio.]
NURSE Marry, farewell!--I pray you, sir, what saucy merchant was this that was so full of his ropery?
ROMEO A gentleman, nurse, that loves to hear himself talk; and will speak more in a minute than he will stand to in a month.
NURSE An 'a speak anything against me, I'll take him down, an'a were lustier than he is, and twenty such Jacks; and if I cannot, I'll find those that shall.
Scurvy knave!
I am none of his flirt-gills; I am none of his skains-mates.--And thou must stand by too, and suffer every knave to use me at his pleasure!
PETER I saw no man use you at his pleasure; if I had, my weapon should quickly have been out, I warrant you: I dare draw as soon as another man, if I see occasion in a good quarrel, and the law on my side.
NURSE Now, afore God, I am so vexed that every part about me quivers.
Scurvy knave!--Pray you, sir, a word: and, as I told you, my young lady bid me enquire you out; what she bade me say I will keep to myself: but first let me tell ye, if ye should lead her into a fool's paradise, as they say, it were a very gross kind of behaviour, as they say: for the gentlewoman is young; and, therefore, if you should deal double with her, truly it were an ill thing to be offered to any gentlewoman, and very weak dealing.
ROMEO Nurse, commend me to thy lady and mistress.
I protest unto thee,--
NURSE Good heart, and i' faith I will tell her as much:
Lord, Lord, she will be a joyful woman.
ROMEO What wilt thou tell her, nurse? thou dost not mark me.
NURSE I will tell her, sir,--that you do protest: which, as I take it, is a gentlemanlike offer.
ROMEO Bid her devise some means to come to shrift This afternoon;
And there she shall at Friar Lawrence' cell Be shriv'd and married.
Here is for thy pains.
NURSE No, truly, sir; not a penny.
ROMEO Go to; I say you shall.
NURSE This afternoon, sir? well, she shall be there.
ROMEO And stay, good nurse, behind the abbey-wall:
Within this hour my man shall be with thee, And bring thee cords made like a tackled stair;
Which to the high top-gallant of my joy Must be my convoy in the secret night.
Farewell; be trusty, and I'll quit thy pains:
Farewell; commend me to thy mistress.
NURSE Now God in heaven bless thee!--Hark you, sir.
ROMEO What say'st thou, my dear nurse?
NURSE Is your man secret?
Did you ne'er hear say,
Two may keep counsel, putting one away?
ROMEO I warrant thee, my man's as true as steel.
NURSE Well, sir; my mistress is the sweetest lady.--Lord, Lord! when 'twas a little prating thing,--O, there's a nobleman in town, one Paris, that would fain lay knife aboard; but she, good soul, had as lief see a toad, a very toad, as see him.
I anger her sometimes, and tell her that Paris is the properer man; but
I'll warrant you, when I say so, she looks as pale as any clout in the versal world.
Doth not Rosemary and Romeo begin both with a letter?
ROMEO Ay, nurse; what of that? both with an R.
NURSE Ah, mocker! that's the dog's name.
R is for the dog: no; I know it begins with some other letter:--and she hath the prettiest sententious of it, of you and Rosemary, that it would do you good to hear it.
ROMEO Commend me to thy lady.
NURSE Ay, a thousand times.
[Exit Romeo.]
--Peter!
PETER Anon?
NURSE Peter, take my fan, and go before.
[Exeunt.]
Scene V. Capulet's Garden.
[Enter Juliet.]
JULlET The clock struck nine when I did send the nurse;
In half an hour she promis'd to return.
Perchance she cannot meet him: that's not so.--
O, she is lame! love's heralds should be thoughts, Which ten times faster glide than the sun's beams,
Driving back shadows over lowering hills:
Therefore do nimble-pinion'd doves draw love,
And therefore hath the wind-swift Cupid wings.
Now is the sun upon the highmost hill
Of this day's journey; and from nine till twelve Is three long hours,--yet she is not come.
Had she affections and warm youthful blood, She'd be as swift in motion as a ball;
My words would bandy her to my sweet love, And his to me:
But old folks, many feign as they were dead; Unwieldy, slow, heavy and pale as lead.--
O God, she comes!
[Enter Nurse and Peter].
O honey nurse, what news?
Hast thou met with him?
Send thy man away.
NURSE Peter, stay at the gate.
[Exit Peter.]
JULlET Now, good sweet nurse,--O Lord, why look'st thou sad?
Though news be sad, yet tell them merrily;
If good, thou sham'st the music of sweet news By playing it to me with so sour a face.
NURSE I am aweary, give me leave awhile;--
Fie, how my bones ache! what a jaunt have I had!
JULlET I would thou hadst my bones, and I thy news: Nay, come, I pray thee speak;--good, good nurse, speak.
NURSE Jesu, what haste? can you not stay awhile?
Do you not see that I am out of breath?
JULlET How art thou out of breath, when thou hast breath To say to me that thou art out of breath?
The excuse that thou dost make in this delay Is longer than the tale thou dost excuse.
Is thy news good or bad? answer to that; Say either, and I'll stay the circumstance:
Let me be satisfied, is't good or bad?
NURSE Well, you have made a simple choice; you know not how to choose a man:
Romeo! no, not he; though his face be better than any man's, yet his leg excels all men's; and for a hand and a foot, and a body,--though they be not to be talked on, yet they are past compare: he is not the flower of courtesy,--but I'll warrant him as gentle as a lamb.--Go thy ways, wench; serve God.-
-What, have you dined at home?
JULlET No, no: but all this did I know before.
What says he of our marriage? what of that?
NURSE Lord, how my head aches! what a head have I!
It beats as it would fall in twenty pieces.
My back o' t' other side,--O, my back, my back!--
Beshrew your heart for sending me about To catch my death with jauncing up and down!
JULlET I' faith, I am sorry that thou art not well.
Sweet, sweet, sweet nurse, tell me, what says my love?
NURSE Your love says, like an honest gentleman, And a courteous, and a kind, and a handsome;
And, I warrant, a virtuous,--Where is your mother?
JULlET Where is my mother?--why, she is within; Where should she be?
How oddly thou repliest!
'Your love says, like an honest gentleman,-- 'Where is your mother?'
NURSE O God's lady dear!
Are you so hot? marry,come up, I trow; Is this the poultice for my aching bones?
Henceforward, do your messages yourself.
JULlET Here's such a coil!--come, what says Romeo?
NURSE Have you got leave to go to shrift to-day?
JULlET I have.
NURSE Then hie you hence to Friar Lawrence' cell;
There stays a husband to make you a wife:
Now comes the wanton blood up in your cheeks,
They'll be in scarlet straight at any news.
Hie you to church; I must another way,
To fetch a ladder, by the which your love Must climb a bird's nest soon when it is dark:
I am the drudge, and toil in your delight; But you shall bear the burden soon at night.
Go; I'll to dinner; hie you to the cell.
JULlET Hie to high fortune!--honest nurse, farewell.
[Exeunt.]
Scene Vl.
Friar Lawrence's Cell.
[Enter Friar Lawrence and Romeo.]
FRlAR So smile the heavens upon this holy act
That after-hours with sorrow chide us not!
ROMEO Amen, amen! but come what sorrow can, It cannot countervail the exchange of joy
That one short minute gives me in her sight:
Do thou but close our hands with holy words,
Then love-devouring death do what he dare,-- It is enough I may but call her mine.
FRlAR These violent delights have violent ends,
And in their triumph die; like fire and powder, Which, as they kiss, consume: the sweetest honey
Is loathsome in his own deliciousness, And in the taste confounds the appetite:
Therefore love moderately: long love doth so; Too swift arrives as tardy as too slow.
Here comes the lady:--O, so light a foot Will ne'er wear out the everlasting flint:
A lover may bestride the gossamer That idles in the wanton summer air
And yet not fall; so light is vanity.
[Enter Juliet.]
JULlET Good-even to my ghostly confessor.
FRlAR Romeo shall thank thee, daughter, for us both.
JULlET As much to him, else is his thanks too much.
ROMEO Ah, Juliet, if the measure of thy joy
Be heap'd like mine, and that thy skill be more To blazon it, then sweeten with thy breath
This neighbour air, and let rich music's tongue Unfold the imagin'd happiness that both
Receive in either by this dear encounter.
JULlET Conceit, more rich in matter than in words,
Brags of his substance, not of ornament:
They are but beggars that can count their worth;
But my true love is grown to such excess, I cannot sum up sum of half my wealth.
FRlAR Come, come with me, and we will make short work;
For, by your leaves, you shall not stay alone Till holy church incorporate two in one.
[Exeunt.]

ROMEO AND JULlET by William Shakespeare
ACT ill.
Scene I. A public Place.
[Enter Mercutio, Benvolio, Page, and Servants.]
BENVOLlO I pray thee, good Mercutio, let's retire: The day is hot, the Capulets abroad,
And, if we meet, we shall not scape a brawl; For now, these hot days, is the mad blood stirring.
MERCUTlO Thou art like one of these fellows that, when he enters the confines of a tavern, claps me his sword upon the table, and says 'God send me no need of thee!' and by the operation of the second cup draws him on the drawer, when indeed there is no need.
BENVOLlO Am I like such a fellow?
MERCUTlO Come, come, thou art as hot a Jack in thy mood as any in
Italy; and as soon moved to be moody, and as soon moody to be moved.
BENVOLlO And what to?
MERCUTlO Nay, an there were two such, we should have none shortly, for one would kill the other.
Thou wilt quarrel with a man for cracking nuts, having no other reason but because thou hast hazel eyes;--what eye but such an eye would spy out such a quarrel?
Thy head is as full of quarrels as an egg is full of meat; and yet thy head hath been beaten as addle as an egg for quarrelling.
Thou hast quarrelled with a man for coughing in the street, because he hath wakened thy dog that hath lain asleep in the sun.
Didst thou not fall out with a tailor for wearing his new doublet before Easter? with another for tying his new shoes with an old riband? and yet thou wilt tutor me from quarrelling!
BENVOLlO An I were so apt to quarrel as thou art, any man should buy the fee simple of my life for an hour and a quarter.
MERCUTlO The fee simple!
O simple!
BENVOLlO By my head, here come the Capulets.
MERCUTlO By my heel, I care not.
[Enter Tybalt and others.]
TYBALT Follow me close, for I will speak to them.--Gentlemen, good-den: a word with one of you.
MERCUTlO And but one word with one of us?
Couple it with something; make it a word and a blow.
TYBALT You shall find me apt enough to that, sir, an you will give me occasion.
MERCUTlO Could you not take some occasion without giving?
TYBALT Mercutio, thou consortest with Romeo,--
MERCUTlO Consort! what, dost thou make us minstrels?
An thou make minstrels of us, look to hear nothing but discords: here's my fiddlestick; here's that shall make you dance.
Zounds, consort!
BENVOLlO We talk here in the public haunt of men:
Either withdraw unto some private place,
And reason coldly of your grievances, Or else depart; here all eyes gaze on us.
MERCUTlO Men's eyes were made to look, and let them gaze;
I will not budge for no man's pleasure, I.
TYBALT Well, peace be with you, sir.--Here comes my man.
[Enter Romeo.]
MERCUTlO But I'll be hanged, sir, if he wear your livery:
Marry, go before to field, he'll be your follower; Your worship in that sense may call him man.
TYBALT Romeo, the love I bear thee can afford
No better term than this,--Thou art a villain.
ROMEO Tybalt, the reason that I have to love thee Doth much excuse the appertaining rage
To such a greeting.
Villain am I none; Therefore farewell; I see thou know'st me not.
TYBALT Boy, this shall not excuse the injuries
That thou hast done me; therefore turn and draw.
ROMEO I do protest I never injur'd thee; But love thee better than thou canst devise
Till thou shalt know the reason of my love:
And so good Capulet,--which name I tender
As dearly as mine own,--be satisfied.
MERCUTlO O calm, dishonourable, vile submission!
Alla stoccata carries it away.
[Draws.]
Tybalt, you rat-catcher, will you walk?
TYBALT What wouldst thou have with me?
MERCUTlO Good king of cats, nothing but one of your nine lives; that I mean to make bold withal, and, as you shall use me hereafter, dry-beat the rest of the eight. Will you pluck your sword out of his pitcher by the ears? make haste, lest mine be about your ears ere it be out.
TYBALT I am for you.
[Drawing.]
ROMEO Gentle Mercutio, put thy rapier up.
MERCUTlO Come, sir, your passado.
[They fight.]
ROMEO Draw, Benvolio; beat down their weapons.-- Gentlemen, for shame! forbear this outrage!--
Tybalt,--Mercutio,--the prince expressly hath Forbid this bandying in Verona streets.--
Hold, Tybalt!--good Mercutio!-- [Exeunt Tybalt with his Partizans.]
MERCUTlO I am hurt;--
A plague o' both your houses!--I am sped.-- Is he gone, and hath nothing?
BENVOLlO What, art thou hurt?
MERCUTlO Ay, ay, a scratch, a scratch; marry, 'tis enough.--
Where is my page?--go, villain, fetch a surgeon.
[Exit Page.]
ROMEO Courage, man; the hurt cannot be much.
MERCUTlO No, 'tis not so deep as a well, nor so wide as a church door; but 'tis enough, 'twill serve: ask for me to-morrow, and you shall find me a grave man.
I am peppered, I warrant, for this world.--A plague o' both your houses!--Zounds, a dog, a rat, a mouse, a cat, to scratch a man to death! a braggart, a rogue, a villain, that fights by the book of arithmetic!--Why the devil came you between us?
I was hurt under your arm.
ROMEO I thought all for the best.
MERCUTlO Help me into some house, Benvolio,
Or I shall faint.--A plague o' both your houses!
They have made worms' meat of me:
I have it, and soundly too.--Your houses!
[Exit Mercutio and Benvolio.]
ROMEO This gentleman, the prince's near ally,
My very friend, hath got his mortal hurt In my behalf; my reputation stain'd
With Tybalt's slander,--Tybalt, that an hour Hath been my kinsman.--O sweet Juliet,
Thy beauty hath made me effeminate And in my temper soften'd valour's steel.
[Re-enter Benvolio.]
BENVOLlO O Romeo, Romeo, brave Mercutio's dead!
That gallant spirit hath aspir'd the clouds,
Which too untimely here did scorn the earth.
ROMEO This day's black fate on more days doth depend; This but begins the woe others must end.
BENVOLlO Here comes the furious Tybalt back again.
ROMEO Alive in triumph! and Mercutio slain!
Away to heaven respective lenity, And fire-ey'd fury be my conduct now!--
[Re-enter Tybalt.]
Now, Tybalt, take the 'villain' back again
That late thou gavest me; for Mercutio's soul Is but a little way above our heads,
Staying for thine to keep him company.
Either thou or I, or both, must go with him.
TYBALT Thou, wretched boy, that didst consort him here,
Shalt with him hence.
ROMEO This shall determine that.
[They fight; Tybalt falls.]
BENVOLlO Romeo, away, be gone!
The citizens are up, and Tybalt slain.--
Stand not amaz'd.
The prince will doom thee death If thou art taken.
Hence, be gone, away!
ROMEO O, I am fortune's fool!
BENVOLlO Why dost thou stay?
[Exit Romeo.]
[Enter Citizens, &amp;c.] 1 ClTIZEN Which way ran he that kill'd Mercutio?
Tybalt, that murderer, which way ran he?
BENVOLlO There lies that Tybalt.
1 ClTIZEN Up, sir, go with me; I charge thee in the prince's name obey.
[Enter Prince, attended; Montague, Capulet, their Wives, and others.]
PRlNCE Where are the vile beginners of this fray?
BENVOLlO O noble prince.
I can discover all
The unlucky manage of this fatal brawl:
There lies the man, slain by young Romeo,
That slew thy kinsman, brave Mercutio.
LADY CAPULET Tybalt, my cousin!
O my brother's child!--
O prince!--O husband!--O, the blood is spill'd Of my dear kinsman!--Prince, as thou art true,
For blood of ours shed blood of Montague.-- O cousin, cousin!
PRlNCE Benvolio, who began this bloody fray?
BENVOLlO Tybalt, here slain, whom Romeo's hand did slay;
Romeo, that spoke him fair, bid him bethink How nice the quarrel was, and urg'd withal
Your high displeasure.--All this,--uttered With gentle breath, calm look, knees humbly bow'd,--
Could not take truce with the unruly spleen Of Tybalt, deaf to peace, but that he tilts
With piercing steel at bold Mercutio's breast; Who, all as hot, turns deadly point to point,
And, with a martial scorn, with one hand beats Cold death aside, and with the other sends
It back to Tybalt, whose dexterity Retorts it:
Romeo he cries aloud,
'Hold, friends! friends, part!' and swifter than his tongue, His agile arm beats down their fatal points,
And 'twixt them rushes; underneath whose arm An envious thrust from Tybalt hit the life
Of stout Mercutio, and then Tybalt fled:
But by-and-by comes back to Romeo,
Who had but newly entertain'd revenge, And to't they go like lightning; for, ere I
Could draw to part them was stout Tybalt slain; And as he fell did Romeo turn and fly.
This is the truth, or let Benvolio die.
LADY CAPULET He is a kinsman to the Montague, Affection makes him false, he speaks not true:
Some twenty of them fought in this black strife, And all those twenty could but kill one life.
I beg for justice, which thou, prince, must give; Romeo slew Tybalt, Romeo must not live.
PRlNCE Romeo slew him; he slew Mercutio:
Who now the price of his dear blood doth owe?
MONTAGUE Not Romeo, prince; he was Mercutio's friend; His fault concludes but what the law should end,
The life of Tybalt.
PRlNCE And for that offence
Immediately we do exile him hence:
I have an interest in your hate's proceeding,
My blood for your rude brawls doth lie a-bleeding; But I'll amerce you with so strong a fine
That you shall all repent the loss of mine: I will be deaf to pleading and excuses;
Nor tears nor prayers shall purchase out abuses, Therefore use none: let Romeo hence in haste,
Else, when he is found, that hour is his last.
Bear hence this body, and attend our will:
Mercy but murders, pardoning those that kill.
[Exeunt.]
Scene Il.
A Room in Capulet's House.
[Enter Juliet.]
JULlET Gallop apace, you fiery-footed steeds,
Towards Phoebus' lodging; such a waggoner As Phaeton would whip you to the west
And bring in cloudy night immediately.-- Spread thy close curtain, love-performing night!
That rude eyes may wink, and Romeo Leap to these arms, untalk'd of and unseen.--
Lovers can see to do their amorous rites By their own beauties: or, if love be blind,
It best agrees with night.--Come, civil night, Thou sober-suited matron, all in black,
And learn me how to lose a winning match, Play'd for a pair of stainless maidenhoods:
Hood my unmann'd blood, bating in my cheeks, With thy black mantle; till strange love, grown bold,
Think true love acted simple modesty.
Come, night;--come, Romeo;--come, thou day in night;
For thou wilt lie upon the wings of night Whiter than new snow upon a raven's back.--
Come, gentle night;--come, loving, black-brow'd night, Give me my Romeo; and, when he shall die,
Take him and cut him out in little stars, And he will make the face of heaven so fine
That all the world will be in love with night, And pay no worship to the garish sun.--
O, I have bought the mansion of a love, But not possess'd it; and, though I am sold,
Not yet enjoy'd: so tedious is this day As is the night before some festival
To an impatient child that hath new robes, And may not wear them.
O, here comes my nurse,
And she brings news; and every tongue that speaks But Romeo's name speaks heavenly eloquence.--
[Enter Nurse, with cords.]
Now, nurse, what news?
What hast thou there? the cords
That Romeo bid thee fetch?
NURSE Ay, ay, the cords.
[Throws them down.]
JULlET Ah me! what news? why dost thou wring thy hands?
NURSE Ah, well-a-day! he's dead, he's dead, he's dead!
We are undone, lady, we are undone!--
Alack the day!--he's gone, he's kill'd, he's dead!
JULlET Can heaven be so envious?
NURSE Romeo can, Though heaven cannot.--O Romeo, Romeo!--
Who ever would have thought it?--Romeo!
JULlET What devil art thou, that dost torment me thus?
This torture should be roar'd in dismal hell.
Hath Romeo slain himself? say thou but I,
And that bare vowel I shall poison more Than the death-darting eye of cockatrice:
I am not I if there be such an I; Or those eyes shut that make thee answer I.
If he be slain, say I; or if not, no: Brief sounds determine of my weal or woe.
NURSE I saw the wound, I saw it with mine eyes,--
God save the mark!--here on his manly breast.
A piteous corse, a bloody piteous corse;
Pale, pale as ashes, all bedaub'd in blood, All in gore-blood;--I swounded at the sight.
JULlET O, break, my heart!--poor bankrout, break at once!
To prison, eyes; ne'er look on liberty!
Vile earth, to earth resign; end motion here;
And thou and Romeo press one heavy bier!
NURSE O Tybalt, Tybalt, the best friend I had!
O courteous Tybalt! honest gentleman!
That ever I should live to see thee dead!
JULlET What storm is this that blows so contrary?
Is Romeo slaughter'd, and is Tybalt dead?
My dear-lov'd cousin, and my dearer lord?-- Then, dreadful trumpet, sound the general doom!
For who is living, if those two are gone?
NURSE Tybalt is gone, and Romeo banished;
Romeo that kill'd him, he is banished.
JULlET O God!--did Romeo's hand shed Tybalt's blood?
NURSE It did, it did; alas the day, it did!
JULlET O serpent heart, hid with a flowering face!
Did ever dragon keep so fair a cave?
Beautiful tyrant! fiend angelical!
Dove-feather'd raven! wolvish-ravening lamb!
Despised substance of divinest show!
Just opposite to what thou justly seem'st, A damned saint, an honourable villain!--
O nature, what hadst thou to do in hell When thou didst bower the spirit of a fiend
In mortal paradise of such sweet flesh?-- Was ever book containing such vile matter
So fairly bound?
O, that deceit should dwell In such a gorgeous palace!
NURSE There's no trust,
No faith, no honesty in men; all perjur'd, All forsworn, all naught, all dissemblers.--
Ah, where's my man?
Give me some aqua vitae.-- These griefs, these woes, these sorrows make me old.
Shame come to Romeo!
JULlET Blister'd be thy tongue For such a wish! he was not born to shame:
Upon his brow shame is asham'd to sit; For 'tis a throne where honour may be crown'd
Sole monarch of the universal earth.
O, what a beast was I to chide at him!
NURSE Will you speak well of him that kill'd your cousin?
JULlET Shall I speak ill of him that is my husband?
Ah, poor my lord, what tongue shall smooth thy name, When I, thy three-hours' wife, have mangled it?--
But wherefore, villain, didst thou kill my cousin?
That villain cousin would have kill'd my husband:
Back, foolish tears, back to your native spring; Your tributary drops belong to woe,
Which you, mistaking, offer up to joy.
My husband lives, that Tybalt would have slain;
And Tybalt's dead, that would have slain my husband:
All this is comfort; wherefore weep I, then?
Some word there was, worser than Tybalt's death, That murder'd me:
I would forget it fain;
But O, it presses to my memory Like damned guilty deeds to sinners' minds:
'Tybalt is dead, and Romeo banished.' That 'banished,' that one word 'banished,'
Hath slain ten thousand Tybalts.
Tybalt's death Was woe enough, if it had ended there:
Or, if sour woe delights in fellowship, And needly will be rank'd with other griefs,--
Why follow'd not, when she said Tybalt's dead, Thy father, or thy mother, nay, or both,
Which modern lamentation might have mov'd?
But with a rear-ward following Tybalt's death,
'Romeo is banished'--to speak that word Is father, mother, Tybalt, Romeo, Juliet,
All slain, all dead:
'Romeo is banished,'-- There is no end, no limit, measure, bound,
In that word's death; no words can that woe sound.-- Where is my father and my mother, nurse?
NURSE Weeping and wailing over Tybalt's corse:
Will you go to them?
I will bring you thither.
JULlET Wash they his wounds with tears: mine shall be spent, When theirs are dry, for Romeo's banishment.
Take up those cords.
Poor ropes, you are beguil'd, Both you and I; for Romeo is exil'd:
He made you for a highway to my bed; But I, a maid, die maiden-widowed.
Come, cords; come, nurse; I'll to my wedding-bed; And death, not Romeo, take my maidenhead!
NURSE Hie to your chamber.
I'll find Romeo
To comfort you: I wot well where he is.
Hark ye, your Romeo will be here at night:
I'll to him; he is hid at Lawrence' cell.
JULlET O, find him! give this ring to my true knight,
And bid him come to take his last farewell.
[Exeunt.]
Scene ill.
Friar Lawrence's cell.
[Enter Friar Lawrence.]
FRlAR Romeo, come forth; come forth, thou fearful man.
Affliction is enanmour'd of thy parts, And thou art wedded to calamity.
[Enter Romeo.]
ROMEO Father, what news? what is the prince's doom
What sorrow craves acquaintance at my hand, That I yet know not?
FRlAR Too familiar
Is my dear son with such sour company: I bring thee tidings of the prince's doom.
ROMEO What less than doomsday is the prince's doom?
FRlAR A gentler judgment vanish'd from his lips,--
Not body's death, but body's banishment.
ROMEO Ha, banishment? be merciful, say death; For exile hath more terror in his look,
Much more than death; do not say banishment.
FRlAR Hence from Verona art thou banished:
Be patient, for the world is broad and wide.
ROMEO There is no world without Verona walls,
But purgatory, torture, hell itself.
Hence-banished is banish'd from the world,
And world's exile is death,--then banished Is death mis-term'd: calling death banishment,
Thou cutt'st my head off with a golden axe, And smil'st upon the stroke that murders me.
FRlAR O deadly sin!
O rude unthankfulness!
Thy fault our law calls death; but the kind prince, Taking thy part, hath brush'd aside the law,
And turn'd that black word death to banishment: This is dear mercy, and thou see'st it not.
ROMEO 'Tis torture, and not mercy: heaven is here,
Where Juliet lives; and every cat, and dog, And little mouse, every unworthy thing,
Live here in heaven, and may look on her; But Romeo may not.--More validity,
More honourable state, more courtship lives In carrion flies than Romeo: they may seize
On the white wonder of dear Juliet's hand, And steal immortal blessing from her lips;
Who, even in pure and vestal modesty, Still blush, as thinking their own kisses sin;
But Romeo may not; he is banished,-- This may flies do, when I from this must fly.
And sayest thou yet that exile is not death!
Hadst thou no poison mix'd, no sharp-ground knife,
No sudden mean of death, though ne'er so mean, But banished to kill me; banished?
O friar, the damned use that word in hell; Howlings attend it: how hast thou the heart,
Being a divine, a ghostly confessor, A sin-absolver, and my friend profess'd,
To mangle me with that word banishment?
FRlAR Thou fond mad man, hear me speak a little,--
ROMEO O, thou wilt speak again of banishment.
FRlAR I'll give thee armour to keep off that word; Adversity's sweet milk, philosophy,
To comfort thee, though thou art banished.
ROMEO Yet banished?
Hang up philosophy!
Unless philosophy can make a Juliet,
Displant a town, reverse a prince's doom, It helps not, it prevails not,--talk no more.
FRlAR O, then I see that madmen have no ears.
ROMEO How should they, when that wise men have no eyes?
FRlAR Let me dispute with thee of thy estate.
ROMEO Thou canst not speak of that thou dost not feel:
Wert thou as young as I, Juliet thy love, An hour but married, Tybalt murdered,
Doting like me, and like me banished, Then mightst thou speak, then mightst thou tear thy hair,
And fall upon the ground, as I do now, Taking the measure of an unmade grave.
[Knocking within.]
FRlAR Arise; one knocks.
Good Romeo, hide thyself.
ROMEO Not I; unless the breath of heartsick groans,
Mist-like infold me from the search of eyes.
[Knocking.]
FRlAR Hark, how they knock!--Who's there?--Romeo, arise;
Thou wilt be taken.--Stay awhile;--Stand up; [Knocking.]
Run to my study.--By-and-by!--God's will!
What simpleness is this.--I come, I come!
[Knocking.]
Who knocks so hard? whence come you? what's your will?
NURSE [Within.]
Let me come in, and you shall know my errand;
I come from Lady Juliet.
FRlAR Welcome then.
[Enter Nurse.]
NURSE O holy friar, O, tell me, holy friar, Where is my lady's lord, where's Romeo?
FRlAR There on the ground, with his own tears made drunk.
NURSE O, he is even in my mistress' case,--
Just in her case!
FRlAR O woeful sympathy!
Piteous predicament!
NURSE Even so lies she,
Blubbering and weeping, weeping and blubbering.-- Stand up, stand up; stand, an you be a man:
For Juliet's sake, for her sake, rise and stand; Why should you fall into so deep an O?
ROMEO Nurse!
NURSE Ah sir! ah sir!--Well, death's the end of all.
ROMEO Spakest thou of Juliet? how is it with her?
Doth not she think me an old murderer, Now I have stain'd the childhood of our joy
With blood remov'd but little from her own?
Where is she? and how doth she? and what says
My conceal'd lady to our cancell'd love?
NURSE O, she says nothing, sir, but weeps and weeps;
And now falls on her bed; and then starts up, And Tybalt calls; and then on Romeo cries,
And then down falls again.
ROMEO As if that name, Shot from the deadly level of a gun,
Did murder her; as that name's cursed hand Murder'd her kinsman.--O, tell me, friar, tell me,
In what vile part of this anatomy Doth my name lodge? tell me, that I may sack
The hateful mansion.
[Drawing his sword.]
FRlAR Hold thy desperate hand:
Art thou a man? thy form cries out thou art; Thy tears are womanish; thy wild acts denote
The unreasonable fury of a beast; Unseemly woman in a seeming man!
Or ill-beseeming beast in seeming both!
Thou hast amaz'd me: by my holy order,
I thought thy disposition better temper'd.
Hast thou slain Tybalt? wilt thou slay thyself?
And slay thy lady, too, that lives in thee, By doing damned hate upon thyself?
Why rail'st thou on thy birth, the heaven, and earth?
Since birth and heaven and earth, all three do meet
In thee at once; which thou at once wouldst lose.
Fie, fie, thou sham'st thy shape, thy love, thy wit;
Which, like a usurer, abound'st in all, And usest none in that true use indeed
Which should bedeck thy shape, thy love, thy wit:
Thy noble shape is but a form of wax,
Digressing from the valour of a man; Thy dear love sworn, but hollow perjury,
Killing that love which thou hast vow'd to cherish; Thy wit, that ornament to shape and love,
Mis-shapen in the conduct of them both, Like powder in a skilless soldier's flask,
Is set a-fire by thine own ignorance, And thou dismember'd with thine own defence.
What, rouse thee, man! thy Juliet is alive, For whose dear sake thou wast but lately dead;
There art thou happy:
Tybalt would kill thee, But thou slewest Tybalt; there art thou happy too:
The law, that threaten'd death, becomes thy friend, And turns it to exile; there art thou happy:
A pack of blessings lights upon thy back; Happiness courts thee in her best array;
But, like a misbehav'd and sullen wench, Thou pout'st upon thy fortune and thy love:--
Take heed, take heed, for such die miserable.
Go, get thee to thy love, as was decreed,
Ascend her chamber, hence and comfort her:
But, look, thou stay not till the watch be set,
For then thou canst not pass to Mantua; Where thou shalt live till we can find a time
To blaze your marriage, reconcile your friends, Beg pardon of the prince, and call thee back
With twenty hundred thousand times more joy Than thou went'st forth in lamentation.--
Go before, nurse: commend me to thy lady; And bid her hasten all the house to bed,
Which heavy sorrow makes them apt unto.
Romeo is coming.
NURSE O Lord, I could have stay'd here all the night
To hear good counsel:
O, what learning is!-- My lord, I'll tell my lady you will come.
ROMEO Do so, and bid my sweet prepare to chide.
NURSE Here, sir, a ring she bid me give you, sir:
Hie you, make haste, for it grows very late.
[Exit.]
ROMEO How well my comfort is reviv'd by this!
FRlAR Go hence; good night! and here stands all your state:
Either be gone before the watch be set, Or by the break of day disguis'd from hence.
Sojourn in Mantua; I'll find out your man, And he shall signify from time to time
Every good hap to you that chances here:
Give me thy hand; 'tis late; farewell; good night.
ROMEO But that a joy past joy calls out on me,
It were a grief so brief to part with thee:
Farewell
[Exeunt.]
Scene IV.
A Room in Capulet's House.
[Enter Capulet, Lady Capulet, and Paris.]
CAPULET Things have fallen out, sir, so unluckily
That we have had no time to move our daughter:
Look you, she lov'd her kinsman Tybalt dearly,
And so did I; well, we were born to die.
'Tis very late; she'll not come down to-night:
I promise you, but for your company, I would have been a-bed an hour ago.
PARlS These times of woe afford no tune to woo.--
Madam, good night: commend me to your daughter.
LADY CAPULET I will, and know her mind early to-morrow; To-night she's mew'd up to her heaviness.
CAPULET Sir Paris, I will make a desperate tender
Of my child's love: I think she will be rul'd In all respects by me; nay more, I doubt it not.--
Wife, go you to her ere you go to bed; Acquaint her here of my son Paris' love;
And bid her, mark you me, on Wednesday next,-- But, soft! what day is this?
PARlS Monday, my lord.
CAPULET Monday! ha, ha!
Well, Wednesday is too soon,
Thursday let it be;--a Thursday, tell her, She shall be married to this noble earl.--
Will you be ready? do you like this haste?
We'll keep no great ado,--a friend or two;
For, hark you, Tybalt being slain so late, It may be thought we held him carelessly,
Being our kinsman, if we revel much:
Therefore we'll have some half a dozen friends,
And there an end.
But what say you to Thursday?
PARlS My lord, I would that Thursday were to-morrow.
CAPULET Well, get you gone: o' Thursday be it then.--
Go you to Juliet, ere you go to bed, Prepare her, wife, against this wedding-day.--
Farewell, my lord.--Light to my chamber, ho!-- Afore me, it is so very very late
That we may call it early by and by.-- Good night.
[Exeunt.]
Scene V. An open Gallery to Juliet's Chamber, overlooking the Garden.
[Enter Romeo and Juliet.]
JULlET Wilt thou be gone? it is not yet near day:
It was the nightingale, and not the lark,
That pierc'd the fearful hollow of thine ear; Nightly she sings on yond pomegranate tree:
Believe me, love, it was the nightingale.
ROMEO It was the lark, the herald of the morn, No nightingale: look, love, what envious streaks
Do lace the severing clouds in yonder east:
Night's candles are burnt out, and jocund day
Stands tiptoe on the misty mountain tops.
I must be gone and live, or stay and die.
JULlET Yond light is not daylight, I know it, I:
It is some meteor that the sun exhales To be to thee this night a torch-bearer
And light thee on the way to Mantua:
Therefore stay yet, thou need'st not to be gone.
ROMEO Let me be ta'en, let me be put to death;
I am content, so thou wilt have it so.
I'll say yon gray is not the morning's eye,
'Tis but the pale reflex of Cynthia's brow; Nor that is not the lark whose notes do beat
The vaulty heaven so high above our heads:
I have more care to stay than will to go.--
Come, death, and welcome!
Juliet wills it so.-- How is't, my soul? let's talk,--it is not day.
JULlET It is, it is!--hie hence, be gone, away!
It is the lark that sings so out of tune, Straining harsh discords and unpleasing sharps.
Some say the lark makes sweet division; This doth not so, for she divideth us:
Some say the lark and loathed toad change eyes; O, now I would they had chang'd voices too!
Since arm from arm that voice doth us affray, Hunting thee hence with hunt's-up to the day.
O, now be gone; more light and light it grows.
ROMEO More light and light,--more dark and dark our woes!
[Enter Nurse.]
NURSE Madam!
JULlET Nurse?
NURSE Your lady mother is coming to your chamber:
The day is broke; be wary, look about.
[Exit.]
JULlET Then, window, let day in, and let life out.
ROMEO Farewell, farewell! one kiss, and I'll descend.
[Descends.]
JULlET Art thou gone so? my lord, my love, my friend!
I must hear from thee every day i' the hour,
For in a minute there are many days:
O, by this count I shall be much in years
Ere I again behold my Romeo!
ROMEO Farewell!
I will omit no opportunity
That may convey my greetings, love, to thee.
JULlET O, think'st thou we shall ever meet again?
ROMEO I doubt it not; and all these woes shall serve
For sweet discourses in our time to come.
JULlET O God!
I have an ill-divining soul!
Methinks I see thee, now thou art below,
As one dead in the bottom of a tomb:
Either my eyesight fails, or thou look'st pale.
ROMEO And trust me, love, in my eye so do you:
Dry sorrow drinks our blood.
Adieu, adieu!
[Exit below.]
JULlET O fortune, fortune! all men call thee fickle:
If thou art fickle, what dost thou with him That is renown'd for faith?
Be fickle, fortune;
For then, I hope, thou wilt not keep him long But send him back.
LADY CAPULET [Within.]
Ho, daughter! are you up?
JULlET Who is't that calls? is it my lady mother?
Is she not down so late, or up so early?
What unaccustom'd cause procures her hither?
[Enter Lady Capulet.]
LADY CAPULET Why, how now, Juliet?
JULlET Madam, I am not well.
LADY CAPULET Evermore weeping for your cousin's death?
What, wilt thou wash him from his grave with tears?
An if thou couldst, thou couldst not make him live; Therefore have done: some grief shows much of love;
But much of grief shows still some want of wit.
JULlET Yet let me weep for such a feeling loss.
LADY CAPULET So shall you feel the loss, but not the friend Which you weep for.
JULlET Feeling so the loss,
I cannot choose but ever weep the friend.
LADY CAPULET Well, girl, thou weep'st not so much for his death As that the villain lives which slaughter'd him.
JULlET What villain, madam?
LADY CAPULET That same villain Romeo.
JULlET Villain and he be many miles asunder.--
God pardon him!
I do, with all my heart; And yet no man like he doth grieve my heart.
LADY CAPULET That is because the traitor murderer lives.
JULlET Ay, madam, from the reach of these my hands.
Would none but I might venge my cousin's death!
LADY CAPULET We will have vengeance for it, fear thou not:
Then weep no more.
I'll send to one in Mantua,--
Where that same banish'd runagate doth live,-- Shall give him such an unaccustom'd dram
That he shall soon keep Tybalt company:
And then I hope thou wilt be satisfied.
JULlET Indeed I never shall be satisfied
With Romeo till I behold him--dead-- Is my poor heart so for a kinsman vex'd:
Madam, if you could find out but a man To bear a poison, I would temper it,
That Romeo should, upon receipt thereof, Soon sleep in quiet.
O, how my heart abhors
To hear him nam'd,--and cannot come to him,-- To wreak the love I bore my cousin Tybalt
Upon his body that hath slaughter'd him!
LADY CAPULET Find thou the means, and I'll find such a man.
But now I'll tell thee joyful tidings, girl.
JULlET And joy comes well in such a needy time:
What are they, I beseech your ladyship?
LADY CAPULET Well, well, thou hast a careful father, child; One who, to put thee from thy heaviness,
Hath sorted out a sudden day of joy That thou expect'st not, nor I look'd not for.
JULlET Madam, in happy time, what day is that?
LADY CAPULET Marry, my child, early next Thursday morn
The gallant, young, and noble gentleman, The County Paris, at St. Peter's Church,
Shall happily make thee there a joyful bride.
JULlET Now by Saint Peter's Church, and Peter too,
He shall not make me there a joyful bride.
I wonder at this haste; that I must wed
Ere he that should be husband comes to woo.
I pray you, tell my lord and father, madam,
I will not marry yet; and when I do, I swear It shall be Romeo, whom you know I hate,
Rather than Paris:--these are news indeed!
LADY CAPULET Here comes your father: tell him so yourself, And see how he will take it at your hands.
[Enter Capulet and Nurse.]
CAPULET When the sun sets, the air doth drizzle dew; But for the sunset of my brother's son
It rains downright.-- How now! a conduit, girl? what, still in tears?
Evermore showering?
In one little body Thou counterfeit'st a bark, a sea, a wind:
For still thy eyes, which I may call the sea, Do ebb and flow with tears; the bark thy body is,
Sailing in this salt flood; the winds, thy sighs; Who,--raging with thy tears and they with them,--
Without a sudden calm, will overset Thy tempest-tossed body.--How now, wife!
Have you deliver'd to her our decree?
LADY CAPULET Ay, sir; but she will none, she gives you thanks.
I would the fool were married to her grave!
CAPULET Soft! take me with you, take me with you, wife.
How! will she none? doth she not give us thanks?
Is she not proud? doth she not count her bles'd,
Unworthy as she is, that we have wrought So worthy a gentleman to be her bridegroom?
JULlET Not proud you have; but thankful that you have:
Proud can I never be of what I hate; But thankful even for hate that is meant love.
CAPULET How now, how now, chop-logic! What is this?
Proud,--and, I thank you,--and I thank you not;-- And yet not proud:--mistress minion, you,
Thank me no thankings, nor proud me no prouds, But fettle your fine joints 'gainst Thursday next
To go with Paris to Saint Peter's Church, Or I will drag thee on a hurdle thither.
Out, you green-sickness carrion! out, you baggage!
You tallow-face!
LADY CAPULET Fie, fie! what, are you mad?
JULlET Good father, I beseech you on my knees,
Hear me with patience but to speak a word.
CAPULET Hang thee, young baggage! disobedient wretch!
I tell thee what,--get thee to church o' Thursday, Or never after look me in the face:
Speak not, reply not, do not answer me; My fingers itch.--Wife, we scarce thought us bles'd
That God had lent us but this only child; But now I see this one is one too much,
And that we have a curse in having her:
Out on her, hilding!
NURSE God in heaven bless her!--
You are to blame, my lord, to rate her so.
CAPULET And why, my lady wisdom? hold your tongue, Good prudence; smatter with your gossips, go.
NURSE I speak no treason.
CAPULET O, God ye good-en!
NURSE May not one speak?
CAPULET Peace, you mumbling fool!
Utter your gravity o'er a gossip's bowl, For here we need it not.
LADY CAPULET You are too hot.
CAPULET God's bread! it makes me mad:
Day, night, hour, time, tide, work, play, Alone, in company, still my care hath been
To have her match'd, and having now provided A gentleman of noble parentage,
Of fair demesnes, youthful, and nobly train'd, Stuff'd, as they say, with honourable parts,
Proportion'd as one's heart would wish a man,-- And then to have a wretched puling fool,
A whining mammet, in her fortune's tender, To answer, 'I'll not wed,--I cannot love,
I am too young,--I pray you pardon me:'-- But, an you will not wed, I'll pardon you:
Graze where you will, you shall not house with me:
Look to't, think on't, I do not use to jest.
Thursday is near; lay hand on heart, advise:
An you be mine, I'll give you to my friend;
An you be not, hang, beg, starve, die i' the streets, For, by my soul, I'll ne'er acknowledge thee,
Nor what is mine shall never do thee good:
Trust to't, bethink you, I'll not be forsworn.
[Exit.]
JULlET Is there no pity sitting in the clouds, That sees into the bottom of my grief?
O, sweet my mother, cast me not away!
Delay this marriage for a month, a week;
Or, if you do not, make the bridal bed In that dim monument where Tybalt lies.
LADY CAPULET Talk not to me, for I'll not speak a word;
Do as thou wilt, for I have done with thee.
[Exit.]
JULlET O God!--O nurse! how shall this be prevented?
My husband is on earth, my faith in heaven; How shall that faith return again to earth,
Unless that husband send it me from heaven By leaving earth?--comfort me, counsel me.--
Alack, alack, that heaven should practise stratagems Upon so soft a subject as myself!--
What say'st thou? hast thou not a word of joy?
Some comfort, nurse.
NURSE Faith, here 'tis; Romeo
Is banished; and all the world to nothing That he dares ne'er come back to challenge you;
Or if he do, it needs must be by stealth.
Then, since the case so stands as now it doth,
I think it best you married with the county.
O, he's a lovely gentleman!
Romeo's a dishclout to him; an eagle, madam, Hath not so green, so quick, so fair an eye
As Paris hath.
Beshrew my very heart, I think you are happy in this second match,
For it excels your first: or if it did not, Your first is dead; or 'twere as good he were,
As living here, and you no use of him.
JULlET Speakest thou this from thy heart?
NURSE And from my soul too;
Or else beshrew them both.
JULlET Amen!
NURSE What?
JULlET Well, thou hast comforted me marvellous much.
Go in; and tell my lady I am gone, Having displeas'd my father, to Lawrence' cell,
To make confession and to be absolv'd.
NURSE Marry, I will; and this is wisely done.
[Exit.]
JULlET Ancient damnation!
O most wicked fiend! Is it more sin to wish me thus forsworn,
Or to dispraise my lord with that same tongue Which she hath prais'd him with above compare
So many thousand times?--Go, counsellor; Thou and my bosom henceforth shall be twain.--
I'll to the friar to know his remedy; If all else fail, myself have power to die.
[Exit.]

ROMEO AND JULlET by William Shakespeare
ACT IV.
Scene I. Friar Lawrence's Cell.
[Enter Friar Lawrence and Paris.]
FRlAR On Thursday, sir? the time is very short.
PARlS My father Capulet will have it so; And I am nothing slow to slack his haste.
FRlAR You say you do not know the lady's mind:
Uneven is the course; I like it not.
PARlS Immoderately she weeps for Tybalt's death, And therefore have I little talk'd of love;
For Venus smiles not in a house of tears.
Now, sir, her father counts it dangerous
That she do give her sorrow so much sway; And, in his wisdom, hastes our marriage,
To stop the inundation of her tears; Which, too much minded by herself alone,
May be put from her by society:
Now do you know the reason of this haste.
FRlAR [Aside.]
I would I knew not why it should be slow'd.--
Look, sir, here comes the lady toward my cell.
[Enter Juliet.]
PARlS Happily met, my lady and my wife!
JULlET That may be, sir, when I may be a wife.
PARlS That may be must be, love, on Thursday next.
JULlET What must be shall be.
FRlAR That's a certain text.
PARlS Come you to make confession to this father?
JULlET To answer that, I should confess to you.
PARlS Do not deny to him that you love me.
JULlET I will confess to you that I love him.
PARlS So will ye, I am sure, that you love me.
JULlET If I do so, it will be of more price,
Being spoke behind your back than to your face.
PARlS Poor soul, thy face is much abus'd with tears.
JULlET The tears have got small victory by that; For it was bad enough before their spite.
PARlS Thou wrong'st it more than tears with that report.
JULlET That is no slander, sir, which is a truth;
And what I spake, I spake it to my face.
PARlS Thy face is mine, and thou hast slander'd it.
JULlET It may be so, for it is not mine own.-- Are you at leisure, holy father, now;
Or shall I come to you at evening mass?
FRlAR My leisure serves me, pensive daughter, now.-- My lord, we must entreat the time alone.
PARlS God shield I should disturb devotion!--
Juliet, on Thursday early will I rouse you:
Till then, adieu; and keep this holy kiss.
[Exit.]
JULlET O, shut the door! and when thou hast done so, Come weep with me; past hope, past cure, past help!
FRlAR Ah, Juliet, I already know thy grief;
It strains me past the compass of my wits: I hear thou must, and nothing may prorogue it,
On Thursday next be married to this county.
JULlET Tell me not, friar, that thou hear'st of this, Unless thou tell me how I may prevent it:
If, in thy wisdom, thou canst give no help, Do thou but call my resolution wise,
And with this knife I'll help it presently.
God join'd my heart and Romeo's, thou our hands;
And ere this hand, by thee to Romeo's seal'd, Shall be the label to another deed,
Or my true heart with treacherous revolt Turn to another, this shall slay them both:
Therefore, out of thy long-experienc'd time, Give me some present counsel; or, behold,
'Twixt my extremes and me this bloody knife Shall play the empire; arbitrating that
Which the commission of thy years and art Could to no issue of true honour bring.
Be not so long to speak; I long to die, If what thou speak'st speak not of remedy.
FRlAR Hold, daughter.
I do spy a kind of hope,
Which craves as desperate an execution As that is desperate which we would prevent.
If, rather than to marry County Paris Thou hast the strength of will to slay thyself,
Then is it likely thou wilt undertake A thing like death to chide away this shame,
That cop'st with death himself to scape from it; And, if thou dar'st, I'll give thee remedy.
JULlET O, bid me leap, rather than marry Paris,
From off the battlements of yonder tower; Or walk in thievish ways; or bid me lurk
Where serpents are; chain me with roaring bears; Or shut me nightly in a charnel-house,
O'er-cover'd quite with dead men's rattling bones, With reeky shanks and yellow chapless skulls;
Or bid me go into a new-made grave, And hide me with a dead man in his shroud;
Things that, to hear them told, have made me tremble; And I will do it without fear or doubt,
To live an unstain'd wife to my sweet love.
FRlAR Hold, then; go home, be merry, give consent To marry Paris:
Wednesday is to-morrow;
To-morrow night look that thou lie alone, Let not thy nurse lie with thee in thy chamber:
Take thou this vial, being then in bed, And this distilled liquor drink thou off:
When, presently, through all thy veins shall run A cold and drowsy humour; for no pulse
Shall keep his native progress, but surcease:
No warmth, no breath, shall testify thou livest;
The roses in thy lips and cheeks shall fade To paly ashes; thy eyes' windows fall,
Like death, when he shuts up the day of life; Each part, depriv'd of supple government,
Shall, stiff and stark and cold, appear like death:
And in this borrow'd likeness of shrunk death
Thou shalt continue two-and-forty hours, And then awake as from a pleasant sleep.
Now, when the bridegroom in the morning comes To rouse thee from thy bed, there art thou dead:
Then,--as the manner of our country is,-- In thy best robes, uncover'd, on the bier,
Thou shalt be borne to that same ancient vault Where all the kindred of the Capulets lie.
In the mean time, against thou shalt awake, Shall Romeo by my letters know our drift;
And hither shall he come: and he and I Will watch thy waking, and that very night
Shall Romeo bear thee hence to Mantua.
And this shall free thee from this present shame,
If no inconstant toy nor womanish fear Abate thy valour in the acting it.
JULlET Give me, give me!
O, tell not me of fear!
FRlAR Hold; get you gone, be strong and prosperous
In this resolve:
I'll send a friar with speed To Mantua, with my letters to thy lord.
JULlET Love give me strength! and strength shall help afford.
Farewell, dear father.
[Exeunt.]
Scene Il.
Hall in Capulet's House.
[Enter Capulet, Lady Capulet, Nurse, and Servants.]
CAPULET So many guests invite as here are writ.--
[Exit first Servant.]
Sirrah, go hire me twenty cunning cooks.
2 SERVANT You shall have none ill, sir; for I'll try if they can lick their fingers.
CAPULET How canst thou try them so?
2 SERVANT Marry, sir, 'tis an ill cook that cannot lick his own fingers: therefore he that cannot lick his fingers goes not with me.
CAPULET Go, begone.--
[Exit second Servant.]
We shall be much unfurnish'd for this time.--
What, is my daughter gone to Friar Lawrence?
NURSE Ay, forsooth.
CAPULET Well, be may chance to do some good on her:
A peevish self-will'd harlotry it is.
NURSE See where she comes from shrift with merry look.
[Enter Juliet.]
CAPULET How now, my headstrong! where have you been gadding?
JULlET Where I have learn'd me to repent the sin Of disobedient opposition
To you and your behests; and am enjoin'd By holy Lawrence to fall prostrate here,
To beg your pardon:--pardon, I beseech you!
Henceforward I am ever rul'd by you.
CAPULET Send for the county; go tell him of this:
I'll have this knot knit up to-morrow morning.
JULlET I met the youthful lord at Lawrence' cell;
And gave him what becomed love I might, Not stepping o'er the bounds of modesty.
CAPULET Why, I am glad on't; this is well,--stand up,--
This is as't should be.--Let me see the county; Ay, marry, go, I say, and fetch him hither.--
Now, afore God, this reverend holy friar, All our whole city is much bound to him.
JULlET Nurse, will you go with me into my closet,
To help me sort such needful ornaments As you think fit to furnish me to-morrow?
LADY CAPULET No, not till Thursday; there is time enough.
CAPULET Go, nurse, go with her.--We'll to church to-morrow.
[Exeunt Juliet and Nurse.]
LADY CAPULET We shall be short in our provision:
'Tis now near night.
CAPULET Tush, I will stir about,
And all things shall be well, I warrant thee, wife:
Go thou to Juliet, help to deck up her;
I'll not to bed to-night;--let me alone; I'll play the housewife for this once.--What, ho!--
They are all forth: well, I will walk myself To County Paris, to prepare him up
Against to-morrow: my heart is wondrous light Since this same wayward girl is so reclaim'd.
[Exeunt.]
Scene ill.
Juliet's Chamber.
[Enter Juliet and Nurse.]
JULlET Ay, those attires are best:--but, gentle nurse,
I pray thee, leave me to myself to-night; For I have need of many orisons
To move the heavens to smile upon my state, Which, well thou know'st, is cross and full of sin.
[Enter Lady Capulet.]
LADY CAPULET What, are you busy, ho? need you my help?
JULlET No, madam; we have cull'd such necessaries As are behoveful for our state to-morrow:
So please you, let me now be left alone, And let the nurse this night sit up with you;
For I am sure you have your hands full all In this so sudden business.
LADY CAPULET Good night:
Get thee to bed, and rest; for thou hast need.
[Exeunt Lady Capulet and Nurse.]
JULlET Farewell!--God knows when we shall meet again.
I have a faint cold fear thrills through my veins That almost freezes up the heat of life:
I'll call them back again to comfort me;-- Nurse!--What should she do here?
My dismal scene I needs must act alone.-- Come, vial.--
What if this mixture do not work at all?
Shall I be married, then, to-morrow morning?-- No, No!--this shall forbid it:--lie thou there.-- [Laying down her dagger.]
What if it be a poison, which the friar Subtly hath minister'd to have me dead,
Lest in this marriage he should be dishonour'd, Because he married me before to Romeo?
I fear it is: and yet methinks it should not, For he hath still been tried a holy man:--
I will not entertain so bad a thought.-- How if, when I am laid into the tomb,
I wake before the time that Romeo Come to redeem me? there's a fearful point!
Shall I not then be stifled in the vault, To whose foul mouth no healthsome air breathes in,
And there die strangled ere my Romeo comes?
Or, if I live, is it not very like
The horrible conceit of death and night, Together with the terror of the place,--
As in a vault, an ancient receptacle, Where, for this many hundred years, the bones
Of all my buried ancestors are pack'd; Where bloody Tybalt, yet but green in earth,
Lies festering in his shroud; where, as they say, At some hours in the night spirits resort;--
Alack, alack, is it not like that I, So early waking,--what with loathsome smells,
And shrieks like mandrakes torn out of the earth, That living mortals, hearing them, run mad;--
O, if I wake, shall I not be distraught, Environed with all these hideous fears?
And madly play with my forefathers' joints?
And pluck the mangled Tybalt from his shroud?
And, in this rage, with some great kinsman's bone, As with a club, dash out my desperate brains?--
O, look! methinks I see my cousin's ghost Seeking out Romeo, that did spit his body
Upon a rapier's point:--stay, Tybalt, stay!-- Romeo, I come! this do I drink to thee.
[Throws herself on the bed.]
Scene IV.
Hall in Capulet's House.
[Enter Lady Capulet and Nurse.]
LADY CAPULET Hold, take these keys and fetch more spices, nurse.
NURSE They call for dates and quinces in the pastry.
[Enter Capulet.]
CAPULET Come, stir, stir, stir!
The second cock hath crow'd,
The curfew bell hath rung, 'tis three o'clock:-- Look to the bak'd meats, good Angelica;
Spare not for cost.
NURSE Go, you cot-quean, go, Get you to bed; faith, you'll be sick to-morrow
For this night's watching.
CAPULET No, not a whit: what!
I have watch'd ere now All night for lesser cause, and ne'er been sick.
LADY CAPULET Ay, you have been a mouse-hunt in your time;
But I will watch you from such watching now.
[Exeunt Lady Capulet and Nurse.]
CAPULET A jealous-hood, a jealous-hood!--Now, fellow,
[Enter Servants, with spits, logs and baskets.]
What's there?
1 SERVANT Things for the cook, sir; but I know not what.
CAPULET Make haste, make haste.
[Exit 1 Servant.]
--Sirrah, fetch drier logs:
Call Peter, he will show thee where they are.
2 SERVANT I have a head, sir, that will find out logs
And never trouble Peter for the matter.
[Exit.]
CAPULET Mass, and well said; a merry whoreson, ha!
Thou shalt be logger-head.--Good faith, 'tis day.
The county will be here with music straight,
For so he said he would:--I hear him near.
[Music within.]
Nurse!--wife!--what, ho!--what, nurse, I say!
[Re-enter Nurse.]
Go, waken Juliet; go and trim her up; I'll go and chat with Paris:--hie, make haste,
Make haste; the bridegroom he is come already:
Make haste, I say.
[Exeunt.]
Scene V. Juliet's Chamber; Juliet on the bed.
[Enter Nurse.]
NURSE Mistress!--what, mistress!--Juliet!--fast, I warrant her, she:--
Why, lamb!--why, lady!--fie, you slug-abed!-- Why, love, I say!--madam! sweetheart!--why, bride!--
What, not a word?--you take your pennyworths now; Sleep for a week; for the next night, I warrant,
The County Paris hath set up his rest That you shall rest but little.--God forgive me!
Marry, and amen, how sound is she asleep!
I needs must wake her.--Madam, madam, madam!--
Ay, let the county take you in your bed; He'll fright you up, i' faith.--Will it not be?
What, dress'd! and in your clothes! and down again!
I must needs wake you.--lady! lady! lady!--
Alas, alas!--Help, help!
My lady's dead!-- O, well-a-day that ever I was born!--
Some aqua-vitae, ho!--my lord! my lady!
[Enter Lady Capulet.]
LADY CAPULET What noise is here?
NURSE O lamentable day!
LADY CAPULET What is the matter?
NURSE Look, look!
O heavy day!
LADY CAPULET O me, O me!--my child, my only life!
Revive, look up, or I will die with thee!-- Help, help!--call help.
[Enter Capulet.]
CAPULET For shame, bring Juliet forth; her lord is come.
NURSE She's dead, deceas'd, she's dead; alack the day!
LADY CAPULET Alack the day, she's dead, she's dead, she's dead!
CAPULET Ha! let me see her:--out alas! she's cold;
Her blood is settled, and her joints are stiff; Life and these lips have long been separated:
Death lies on her like an untimely frost Upon the sweetest flower of all the field.
Accursed time! unfortunate old man!
NURSE O lamentable day!
LADY CAPULET O woful time!
CAPULET Death, that hath ta'en her hence to make me wail,
Ties up my tongue and will not let me speak.
[Enter Friar Lawrence and Paris, with Musicians.]
FRlAR Come, is the bride ready to go to church?
CAPULET Ready to go, but never to return:--
O son, the night before thy wedding day Hath death lain with thy bride:--there she lies,
Flower as she was, deflowered by him.
Death is my son-in-law, death is my heir;
My daughter he hath wedded: I will die.
And leave him all; life, living, all is death's.
PARlS Have I thought long to see this morning's face,
And doth it give me such a sight as this?
LADY CAPULET Accurs'd, unhappy, wretched, hateful day!
Most miserable hour that e'er time saw
In lasting labour of his pilgrimage!
But one, poor one, one poor and loving child,
But one thing to rejoice and solace in, And cruel death hath catch'd it from my sight!
NURSE O woe!
O woeful, woeful, woeful day!
Most lamentable day, most woeful day That ever, ever, I did yet behold!
O day!
O day!
O day! O hateful day!
Never was seen so black a day as this:
O woeful day!
O woeful day!
PARlS Beguil'd, divorced, wronged, spited, slain!
Most detestable death, by thee beguil'd,
By cruel cruel thee quite overthrown!-- O love!
O life!--not life, but love in death!
CAPULET Despis'd, distressed, hated, martyr'd, kill'd!--
Uncomfortable time, why cam'st thou now To murder, murder our solemnity?--
O child!
O child!--my soul, and not my child!-- Dead art thou, dead!--alack, my child is dead;
And with my child my joys are buried!
FRlAR Peace, ho, for shame! confusion's cure lives not
In these confusions.
Heaven and yourself Had part in this fair maid; now heaven hath all,
And all the better is it for the maid:
Your part in her you could not keep from death;
But heaven keeps his part in eternal life.
The most you sought was her promotion;
For 'twas your heaven she should be advanc'd:
And weep ye now, seeing she is advanc'd
Above the clouds, as high as heaven itself?
O, in this love, you love your child so ill
That you run mad, seeing that she is well:
She's not well married that lives married long:
But she's best married that dies married young.
Dry up your tears, and stick your rosemary
On this fair corse; and, as the custom is, In all her best array bear her to church;
For though fond nature bids us all lament, Yet nature's tears are reason's merriment.
CAPULET All things that we ordained festival
Turn from their office to black funeral:
Our instruments to melancholy bells;
Our wedding cheer to a sad burial feast; Our solemn hymns to sullen dirges change;
Our bridal flowers serve for a buried corse, And all things change them to the contrary.
FRlAR Sir, go you in,--and, madam, go with him;--
And go, Sir Paris;--every one prepare To follow this fair corse unto her grave:
The heavens do lower upon you for some ill; Move them no more by crossing their high will.
[Exeunt Capulet, Lady Capulet, Paris, and Friar.] 1 MUSlCIAN Faith, we may put up our pipes and be gone.
NURSE Honest good fellows, ah, put up, put up; For well you know this is a pitiful case.
[Exit.]
1 MUSlCIAN Ay, by my troth, the case may be amended.
[Enter Peter.]
PETER Musicians, O, musicians, 'Heart's ease,' 'Heart's ease':
O, an you will have me live, play 'Heart's ease.'
1 MUSlCIAN Why 'Heart's ease'?
PETER O, musicians, because my heart itself plays 'My heart is full of woe':
O, play me some merry dump to comfort me.
1 MUSlCIAN Not a dump we: 'tis no time to play now.
PETER You will not then?
1 MUSlCIAN No.
PETER I will then give it you soundly.
1 MUSlCIAN What will you give us?
PETER No money, on my faith; but the gleek,--I will give you the minstrel.
1 MUSlCIAN Then will I give you the serving-creature.
PETER Then will I lay the serving-creature's dagger on your pate.
I will carry no crotchets:
I'll re you, I'll fa you: do you note me?
1 MUSlCIAN An you re us and fa us, you note us.
2 MUSlCIAN Pray you put up your dagger, and put out your wit.
PETER Then have at you with my wit!
I will dry-beat you with an iron wit, and put up my iron dagger.--Answer me like men:
'When griping grief the heart doth wound, And doleful dumps the mind oppress,
Then music with her silver sound'-- why 'silver sound'? why 'music with her silver sound'?--
What say you, Simon Catling?
1 MUSlCIAN Marry, sir, because silver hath a sweet sound.
PETER Pretty!--What say you, Hugh Rebeck?
2 MUSlCIAN I say 'silver sound' because musicians sound for silver.
PETER Pretty too!--What say you, James Soundpost?
3 MUSlCIAN Faith, I know not what to say.
PETER O, I cry you mercy; you are the singer: I will say for you.
It is 'music with her silver sound' because musicians have no gold for sounding:--
'Then music with her silver sound With speedy help doth lend redress.'
[Exit.]
1 MUSlCIAN What a pestilent knave is this same!
2 MUSlCIAN Hang him, Jack!--Come, we'll in here; tarry for the mourners, and stay dinner.
[Exeunt.] &gt;
ROMEO AND JULlET by William Shakespeare
Act V. Scene I. Mantua.
A Street.
[Enter Romeo.]
ROMEO If I may trust the flattering eye of sleep, My dreams presage some joyful news at hand;
My bosom's lord sits lightly in his throne; And all this day an unaccustom'd spirit
Lifts me above the ground with cheerful thoughts.
I dreamt my lady came and found me dead,--
Strange dream, that gives a dead man leave to think!-- And breath'd such life with kisses in my lips,
That I reviv'd, and was an emperor.
Ah me! how sweet is love itself possess'd,
When but love's shadows are so rich in joy!
[Enter Balthasar.]
News from Verona!--How now, Balthasar?
Dost thou not bring me letters from the friar?
How doth my lady?
Is my father well?
How fares my Juliet? that I ask again;
For nothing can be ill if she be well.
BALTHASAR Then she is well, and nothing can be ill: Her body sleeps in Capel's monument,
And her immortal part with angels lives.
I saw her laid low in her kindred's vault,
And presently took post to tell it you:
O, pardon me for bringing these ill news,
Since you did leave it for my office, sir.
ROMEO Is it even so? then I defy you, stars!-- Thou know'st my lodging: get me ink and paper,
And hire post-horses.
I will hence to-night.
BALTHASAR
I do beseech you, sir, have patience:
Your looks are pale and wild, and do import
Some misadventure.
ROMEO Tush, thou art deceiv'd: Leave me, and do the thing I bid thee do.
Hast thou no letters to me from the friar?
BALTHASAR No, my good lord.
ROMEO No matter: get thee gone, And hire those horses; I'll be with thee straight.
[Exit Balthasar.]
Well, Juliet, I will lie with thee to-night.
Let's see for means;--O mischief, thou art swift To enter in the thoughts of desperate men!
I do remember an apothecary,-- And hereabouts he dwells,--which late I noted
In tatter'd weeds, with overwhelming brows, Culling of simples; meagre were his looks,
Sharp misery had worn him to the bones; And in his needy shop a tortoise hung,
An alligator stuff'd, and other skins Of ill-shaped fishes; and about his shelves
A beggarly account of empty boxes, Green earthen pots, bladders, and musty seeds,
Remnants of packthread, and old cakes of roses, Were thinly scatter'd, to make up a show.
Noting this penury, to myself I said, An if a man did need a poison now,
Whose sale is present death in Mantua, Here lives a caitiff wretch would sell it him.
O, this same thought did but forerun my need; And this same needy man must sell it me.
As I remember, this should be the house: Being holiday, the beggar's shop is shut.--
What, ho! apothecary!
[Enter Apothecary.]
APOTHECARY Who calls so loud?
ROMEO Come hither, man.--I see that thou art poor;
Hold, there is forty ducats: let me have A dram of poison; such soon-speeding gear
As will disperse itself through all the veins That the life-weary taker mall fall dead;
And that the trunk may be discharg'd of breath As violently as hasty powder fir'd
Doth hurry from the fatal cannon's womb.
APOTHECARY Such mortal drugs I have; but Mantua's law Is death to any he that utters them.
ROMEO Art thou so bare and full of wretchedness
And fear'st to die? famine is in thy cheeks, Need and oppression starveth in thine eyes,
Contempt and beggary hangs upon thy back, The world is not thy friend, nor the world's law:
The world affords no law to make thee rich; Then be not poor, but break it and take this.
APOTHECARY My poverty, but not my will consents.
ROMEO I pay thy poverty, and not thy will.
APOTHECARY Put this in any liquid thing you will,
And drink it off; and, if you had the strength Of twenty men, it would despatch you straight.
ROMEO There is thy gold; worse poison to men's souls,
Doing more murders in this loathsome world Than these poor compounds that thou mayst not sell:
I sell thee poison; thou hast sold me none.
Farewell: buy food and get thyself in flesh.--
Come, cordial and not poison, go with me To Juliet's grave; for there must I use thee.
[Exeunt.]
Scene Il.
Friar Lawrence's Cell.
[Enter Friar John.]
FRlAR JOHN Holy Franciscan friar! brother, ho!
[Enter Friar Lawrence.]
FRlAR LAWRENCE This same should be the voice of Friar John.
Welcome from Mantua: what says Romeo?
Or, if his mind be writ, give me his letter.
FRlAR JOHN Going to find a barefoot brother out, One of our order, to associate me,
Here in this city visiting the sick, And finding him, the searchers of the town,
Suspecting that we both were in a house Where the infectious pestilence did reign,
Seal'd up the doors, and would not let us forth; So that my speed to Mantua there was stay'd.
FRlAR LAWRENCE Who bare my letter, then, to Romeo?
FRlAR JOHN I could not send it,--here it is again,--
Nor get a messenger to bring it thee, So fearful were they of infection.
FRlAR LAWRENCE Unhappy fortune! by my brotherhood,
The letter was not nice, but full of charge Of dear import; and the neglecting it
May do much danger.
Friar John, go hence; Get me an iron crow and bring it straight
Unto my cell.
FRlAR JOHN Brother, I'll go and bring it thee.
[Exit.]
FRlAR LAWRENCE Now must I to the monument alone; Within this three hours will fair Juliet wake:
She will beshrew me much that Romeo Hath had no notice of these accidents;
But I will write again to Mantua, And keep her at my cell till Romeo come;--
Poor living corse, clos'd in a dead man's tomb!
[Exit.]
Scene ill.
A churchyard; in it a Monument belonging to the Capulets.
[Enter Paris, and his Page bearing flowers and a torch.]
PARlS Give me thy torch, boy: hence, and stand aloof;-- Yet put it out, for I would not be seen.
Under yond yew tree lay thee all along, Holding thine ear close to the hollow ground;
So shall no foot upon the churchyard tread,-- Being loose, unfirm, with digging up of graves,--
But thou shalt hear it: whistle then to me, As signal that thou hear'st something approach.
Give me those flowers.
Do as I bid thee, go.
PAGE [Aside.]
I am almost afraid to stand alone Here in the churchyard; yet I will adventure.
[Retires.]
PARlS Sweet flower, with flowers thy bridal bed I strew:
O woe! thy canopy is dust and stones!
Which with sweet water nightly I will dew; Or, wanting that, with tears distill'd by moans:
The obsequies that I for thee will keep, Nightly shall be to strew thy grave and weep.
[The Page whistles.]
The boy gives warning something doth approach.
What cursed foot wanders this way to-night, To cross my obsequies and true love's rite?
What, with a torch! muffle me, night, awhile.
[Retires.]
[Enter Romeo and Balthasar with a torch, mattock, &amp;c.]
ROMEO Give me that mattock and the wrenching iron.
Hold, take this letter; early in the morning See thou deliver it to my lord and father.
Give me the light; upon thy life I charge thee, Whate'er thou hear'st or seest, stand all aloof
And do not interrupt me in my course.
Why I descend into this bed of death
Is partly to behold my lady's face, But chiefly to take thence from her dead finger
A precious ring,--a ring that I must use In dear employment: therefore hence, be gone:--
But if thou, jealous, dost return to pry In what I further shall intend to do,
By heaven, I will tear thee joint by joint, And strew this hungry churchyard with thy limbs:
The time and my intents are savage-wild; More fierce and more inexorable far
Than empty tigers or the roaring sea.
BALTHASAR I will be gone, sir, and not trouble you.
ROMEO So shalt thou show me friendship.--Take thou that:
Live, and be prosperous: and farewell, good fellow.
BALTHASAR For all this same, I'll hide me hereabout:
His looks I fear, and his intents I doubt.
[Retires.]
ROMEO Thou detestable maw, thou womb of death,
Gorg'd with the dearest morsel of the earth, Thus I enforce thy rotten jaws to open,
[Breaking open the door of the monument.]
And, in despite, I'll cram thee with more food!
PARlS This is that banish'd haughty Montague
That murder'd my love's cousin,--with which grief, It is supposed, the fair creature died,--
And here is come to do some villanous shame To the dead bodies: I will apprehend him.--
[Advances.]
Stop thy unhallow'd toil, vile Montague!
Can vengeance be pursu'd further than death?
Condemned villain, I do apprehend thee;
Obey, and go with me; for thou must die.
ROMEO I must indeed; and therefore came I hither.-- Good gentle youth, tempt not a desperate man;
Fly hence and leave me:--think upon these gone; Let them affright thee.--I beseech thee, youth,
Put not another sin upon my head By urging me to fury:
O, be gone!
By heaven, I love thee better than myself; For I come hither arm'd against myself:
Stay not, be gone;--live, and hereafter say, A madman's mercy bid thee run away.
PARlS I do defy thy conjurations,
And apprehend thee for a felon here.
ROMEO Wilt thou provoke me? then have at thee, boy!
[They fight.]
PAGE O lord, they fight!
I will go call the watch.
[Exit.]
PARlS O, I am slain!
[Falls.]
If thou be merciful, Open the tomb, lay me with Juliet.
[Dies.]
ROMEO In faith, I will.--Let me peruse this face:-- Mercutio's kinsman, noble County Paris!--
What said my man, when my betossed soul Did not attend him as we rode?
I think
He told me Paris should have married Juliet:
Said he not so? or did I dream it so?
Or am I mad, hearing him talk of Juliet, To think it was so?--O, give me thy hand,
One writ with me in sour misfortune's book!
I'll bury thee in a triumphant grave;--
A grave?
O, no, a lanthorn, slaught'red youth, For here lies Juliet, and her beauty makes
This vault a feasting presence full of light.
Death, lie thou there, by a dead man interr'd.
[Laying Paris in the monument.]
How oft when men are at the point of death
Have they been merry! which their keepers call A lightning before death:
O, how may I
Call this a lightning?--O my love! my wife!
Death, that hath suck'd the honey of thy breath,
Hath had no power yet upon thy beauty:
Thou art not conquer'd; beauty's ensign yet
Is crimson in thy lips and in thy cheeks, And death's pale flag is not advanced there.--
Tybalt, liest thou there in thy bloody sheet?
O, what more favour can I do to thee
Than with that hand that cut thy youth in twain To sunder his that was thine enemy?
Forgive me, cousin!--Ah, dear Juliet, Why art thou yet so fair?
Shall I believe
That unsubstantial death is amorous; And that the lean abhorred monster keeps
Thee here in dark to be his paramour?
For fear of that I still will stay with thee,
And never from this palace of dim night Depart again: here, here will I remain
With worms that are thy chambermaids:
O, here Will I set up my everlasting rest;
And shake the yoke of inauspicious stars From this world-wearied flesh.--Eyes, look your last!
Arms, take your last embrace! and, lips, O you The doors of breath, seal with a righteous kiss
A dateless bargain to engrossing death!-- Come, bitter conduct, come, unsavoury guide!
Thou desperate pilot, now at once run on The dashing rocks thy sea-sick weary bark!
Here's to my love!
[Drinks.]
--O true apothecary!
Thy drugs are quick.--Thus with a kiss I die.
[Dies.]
[Enter, at the other end of the Churchyard, Friar Lawrence, with a lantern, crow, and spade.]
FRlAR Saint Francis be my speed! how oft to-night Have my old feet stumbled at graves!--Who's there?
Who is it that consorts, so late, the dead?
BALTHASAR Here's one, a friend, and one that knows you well.
FRlAR Bliss be upon you!
Tell me, good my friend,
What torch is yond that vainly lends his light To grubs and eyeless skulls? as I discern,
It burneth in the Capels' monument.
BALTHASAR It doth so, holy sir; and there's my master, One that you love.
FRlAR Who is it?
BALTHASAR Romeo.
FRlAR How long hath he been there?
BALTHASAR Full half an hour.
FRlAR Go with me to the vault.
BALTHASAR I dare not, sir;
My master knows not but I am gone hence; And fearfully did menace me with death
If I did stay to look on his intents.
FRlAR Stay then; I'll go alone:--fear comes upon me;
O, much I fear some ill unlucky thing.
BALTHASAR As I did sleep under this yew tree here, I dreamt my master and another fought,
And that my master slew him.
FRlAR Romeo!
[Advances.]
Alack, alack! what blood is this which stains The stony entrance of this sepulchre?--
What mean these masterless and gory swords To lie discolour'd by this place of peace?
[Enters the monument.]
Romeo!
O, pale!--Who else? what, Paris too?
And steep'd in blood?--Ah, what an unkind hour Is guilty of this lamentable chance!--The lady stirs.
[Juliet wakes and stirs.]
JULlET O comfortable friar! where is my lord?-- I do remember well where I should be,
And there I am:--where is my Romeo?
[Noise within.]
FRlAR I hear some noise.--Lady, come from that nest
Of death, contagion, and unnatural sleep:
A greater power than we can contradict
Hath thwarted our intents:--come, come away!
Thy husband in thy bosom there lies dead;
And Paris too:--come, I'll dispose of thee Among a sisterhood of holy nuns:
Stay not to question, for the watch is coming.
Come, go, good Juliet [noise within],--I dare no longer stay.
JULlET Go, get thee hence, for I will not away.--
[Exit Friar Lawrence.]
What's here? a cup, clos'd in my true love's hand?
Poison, I see, hath been his timeless end:-- O churl! drink all, and left no friendly drop
To help me after?--I will kiss thy lips; Haply some poison yet doth hang on them,
To make me die with a restorative.
[Kisses him.]
Thy lips are warm!
1 WATCH [Within.]
Lead, boy:--which way?
JULlET Yea, noise?--Then I'll be brief.--O happy dagger!
[Snatching Romeo's dagger.]
This is thy sheath [stabs herself]; there rest, and let me die.
[Falls on Romeo's body and dies.]
[Enter Watch, with the Page of Paris.]
PAGE This is the place; there, where the torch doth burn.
1 WATCH The ground is bloody; search about the churchyard:
Go, some of you, whoe'er you find attach.
[Exeunt some of the Watch.]
Pitiful sight! here lies the county slain;-- And Juliet bleeding; warm, and newly dead,
Who here hath lain this two days buried.-- Go, tell the prince;--run to the Capulets,--
Raise up the Montagues,--some others search:-- [Exeunt others of the Watch.]
We see the ground whereon these woes do lie; But the true ground of all these piteous woes
We cannot without circumstance descry.
[Re-enter some of the Watch with Balthasar.] 2 WATCH Here's Romeo's man; we found him in the churchyard.
1 WATCH Hold him in safety till the prince come hither.
[Re-enter others of the Watch with Friar Lawrence.] 3 WATCH Here is a friar, that trembles, sighs, and weeps:
We took this mattock and this spade from him
As he was coming from this churchyard side.
1 WATCH A great suspicion: stay the friar too.
[Enter the Prince and Attendants.]
PRlNCE What misadventure is so early up, That calls our person from our morning's rest?
[Enter Capulet, Lady Capulet, and others.]
CAPULET What should it be, that they so shriek abroad?
LADY CAPULET The people in the street cry Romeo,
Some Juliet, and some Paris; and all run, With open outcry, toward our monument.
PRlNCE What fear is this which startles in our ears?
1 WATCH Sovereign, here lies the County Paris slain;
And Romeo dead; and Juliet, dead before, Warm and new kill'd.
PRlNCE Search, seek, and know how this foul murder comes.
1 WATCH Here is a friar, and slaughter'd Romeo's man,
With instruments upon them fit to open These dead men's tombs.
CAPULET O heaven!--O wife, look how our daughter bleeds!
This dagger hath mista'en,--for, lo, his house Is empty on the back of Montague,--
And it mis-sheathed in my daughter's bosom!
LADY CAPULET O me! this sight of death is as a bell
That warns my old age to a sepulchre.
[Enter Montague and others.]
PRlNCE Come, Montague; for thou art early up,
To see thy son and heir more early down.
MONTAGUE Alas, my liege, my wife is dead to-night;
Grief of my son's exile hath stopp'd her breath:
What further woe conspires against mine age?
PRlNCE Look, and thou shalt see.
MONTAGUE O thou untaught! what manners is in this,
To press before thy father to a grave?
PRlNCE Seal up the mouth of outrage for a while, Till we can clear these ambiguities,
And know their spring, their head, their true descent; And then will I be general of your woes,
And lead you even to death: meantime forbear, And let mischance be slave to patience.--
Bring forth the parties of suspicion.
FRlAR I am the greatest, able to do least, Yet most suspected, as the time and place
Doth make against me, of this direful murder; And here I stand, both to impeach and purge
Myself condemned and myself excus'd.
PRlNCE Then say at once what thou dost know in this.
FRlAR I will be brief, for my short date of breath
Is not so long as is a tedious tale.
Romeo, there dead, was husband to that Juliet;
And she, there dead, that Romeo's faithful wife: I married them; and their stol'n marriage day
Was Tybalt's doomsday, whose untimely death Banish'd the new-made bridegroom from this city;
For whom, and not for Tybalt, Juliet pin'd.
You, to remove that siege of grief from her,
Betroth'd, and would have married her perforce, To County Paris:--then comes she to me,
And with wild looks, bid me devise some means To rid her from this second marriage,
Or in my cell there would she kill herself.
Then gave I her, so tutored by my art,
A sleeping potion; which so took effect As I intended, for it wrought on her
The form of death: meantime I writ to Romeo That he should hither come as this dire night,
To help to take her from her borrow'd grave, Being the time the potion's force should cease.
But he which bore my letter, Friar John, Was stay'd by accident; and yesternight
Return'd my letter back.
Then all alone At the prefixed hour of her waking
Came I to take her from her kindred's vault; Meaning to keep her closely at my cell
Till I conveniently could send to Romeo:
But when I came,--some minute ere the time
Of her awaking,--here untimely lay The noble Paris and true Romeo dead.
She wakes; and I entreated her come forth And bear this work of heaven with patience:
But then a noise did scare me from the tomb; And she, too desperate, would not go with me,
But, as it seems, did violence on herself.
All this I know; and to the marriage
Her nurse is privy: and if ought in this Miscarried by my fault, let my old life
Be sacrific'd, some hour before his time, Unto the rigour of severest law.
PRlNCE We still have known thee for a holy man.--
Where's Romeo's man? what can he say in this?
BALTHASAR I brought my master news of Juliet's death;
And then in post he came from Mantua To this same place, to this same monument.
This letter he early bid me give his father; And threaten'd me with death, going in the vault,
If I departed not, and left him there.
PRlNCE Give me the letter,--I will look on it.--
Where is the county's page that rais'd the watch?-- Sirrah, what made your master in this place?
BOY He came with flowers to strew his lady's grave;
And bid me stand aloof, and so I did: Anon comes one with light to ope the tomb;
And by-and-by my master drew on him; And then I ran away to call the watch.
PRlNCE This letter doth make good the friar's words,
Their course of love, the tidings of her death:
And here he writes that he did buy a poison
Of a poor 'pothecary, and therewithal Came to this vault to die, and lie with Juliet.--
Where be these enemies?--Capulet,--Montague,-- See what a scourge is laid upon your hate,
That heaven finds means to kill your joys with love!
And I, for winking at your discords too,
Have lost a brace of kinsmen:--all are punish'd.
CAPULET O brother Montague, give me thy hand:
This is my daughter's jointure, for no more
Can I demand.
MONTAGUE But I can give thee more:
For I will raise her statue in pure gold;
That while Verona by that name is known, There shall no figure at such rate be set
As that of true and faithful Juliet.
CAPULET As rich shall Romeo's by his lady's lie;
Poor sacrifices of our enmity!
PRlNCE A glooming peace this morning with it brings; The sun for sorrow will not show his head.
Go hence, to have more talk of these sad things; Some shall be pardon'd, and some punished;
For never was a story of more woe Than this of Juliet and her Romeo.
[Exeunt.]

Hi.
My name's Ridley Scott.
I'm a film director.
I'm gonna talk to you about "Your Film Festival".
You may already have a film in the can that you've been quietly, privately polishing and nurturing for the last 10 years of your life or the last few weeks of your life, or you can sit down and actually think about what you'd like to do.
Capture it.
Put it down.
Edit it.
Condense it into 15 minutes.
The best of all movies are the ones that are personal, they have a personal story or a personal view on things.
There is no rule book for filmmaking.
I don't care if it's action or adventure - never action just for action's sake - I know some of you may disagree with that.
And if it's original and we like it then you'll end up as one of the shortlisted people.
I'll be one of the judges, so I'll be looking out for it.
You get $500,000 to make a film.
Now given what you're about to make your movies on probably a shoestring and "Who pays for the hamburgers?"
How do we get there in the morning?
Who's going to carry the bag?
500,000 dollars, you could make Ben Hur with that.
From the very first film that I made, which cost 65 pounds, to the last film I made which cost millions, things are always difficult. When you're making a movie, and you've got very little money, that's a good thing. It forces you to plan and forces you to make decisions.
Whatever moment in time, everything seems monumental.
So go out and make the movie.
So, that's not really how Taft Hartley works.
You have to get a job first.
Then you become..
Well, well, well.
As I live and breath.
Nelson Dorkoff has decided to grace our little acting class once again.
Hello, Dickie.
I'm trying to remember.
When is the last time you were here?
I've been working.
An iCarly here, a Big Bang Theory there.
It's actually been pretty busy.
I love the Big Bang Theory.
I don't remember seeing you on it.
Was it a crowd scene?
You know, I don't have that much time to watch TV anymore.
You know I got that recurring role on the Walking Dead.
As a Zombie?
Yes.
And yet, I still find time to come to class.
I must be one of those weird actors who just likes to keep my instrument sharp.
You okay?
You just made me throw up in my mouth a little.
Hey, I am so sorry.
I have not had a moment to email you to say thanks for inviting me to your Birthday party.
I actually didn't.
I know, I came with people who were invited.
But I just really wanted to be there, Nelson.
To watch you turn another year older.
Yeah, about the party. I need...
Exciting news, boys and girls.
Today we're going to be doing improv.
So pair up and prepare to impress me.
What do you say, Nelson?
For old time's sake?
Oh, I wasn't planning on staying.
I need to talk to you about what happened at...
Oh, I totally get it.
You don't want to get up there. You're improv skills are probably really rusty.
Why don't you sneak out the front.
Oh, I am so going to mop the floor with you. Bring it!
Give us a location!
I want to see some real emotions in these scenes, okay?
Some raw emotions.
You're at a party.
Go.
There's a dead body in the bathtub!
No, were in a doctor's office.
I'm here for my physical.
Really?
And, at the party one of the guests saw you having a fight with the victim.
Which would be fine.
If he died of natural causes.
But he didn't die of natural causes.
No he didn't.
The Police ruled his death a homicide.
Which begs the question
What were you two fighting about?
And were you the one who killed him?
Dickey, I knew you had a mean streak, okay.
Because you always put me down and always made fun of me.
But, really?
Killing some poor sap at my 40th Birthday party, just to ruin it.
Well, now you've gone too far!
Nelson.
I know it's been a while since you've been to my class, but it's customary to let your scene partner respond at some point.
Okay. Alright.
What do you have to say for yourself murderer?!
Yes, Dickie, I love your energy, your focus.
Nelson, as usual, you're a little over the top.
So, pull it back a bit.
Call 911!
He really tried to strangle me right there!
I was just doing the scene!
I may have gotten a little carried away.
You know I'm a method actor.
Carried away, my ass!
He was trying to strangle me.
And everything I said really happened at my party.
None of what you said is the truth.
Especially the part about you turning 40.
Wait, wait!
So you deny
That you had a big fight with JCub at my Birthday party?
A fight with JCub.
That guy's a wierdo!
He's a big fan of mine.
He was upset I wouldn't friend him on Facebook.
You know, I'm closing in on 5,000 friends.
Oh, dear God.
I said you can like me on my fan page
But even that wouldn't satisfy him.
So then he gets this phone call and that's when he really freaked out.
About what?
I don't know Nelson.
I don't eve's drop.
He was talking to this guy he was dating.
And he was really upset because they got in a fight over at Jackie Beats's drag show a couple of days before.
But I stopped listening at that point, be cause it got really tedious.
Just like your Birthday party!
Guys!
This scene is aimless.
Let's try something else.
Dickie, you start.
You're in a psychiatrist's office. Go!
Nelson, why are you so insecurity that you lie about your age and about the parts you play on television?
I'm here to get my car repaired.
On a skateboard with handles?
What are you grabbing boobs?
Little legs?
Be specific!!
He can't even strangle right.
This feeling 'I am,' itself, it's like a cocktail between pure being and thought; a bridge between matter and spirit, the feeling 'I am.'
Nisargadatta Maharaj, he used it this way, he says,
'The I am is like a door,' - he says, no? -
'that swings one way towards the whole of manifestation, and the other way to infinity.' This door, he called the 'I am.' Okay?
I, myself, am referring to it as this sliding bar - because we had these scales; I remember we had these scales and you had this bar - you slide it one way and slide it the other way.
So when the sense 'I' is moving towards the body-mind identification, it feels the sense 'I am me'; it's ego. Okay?
When it slides more, - meaning the attention goes with the 'I am,' only as the witness - when it stays as the witness, it feels spacious, light, full of joy and space. You see?
You may call that 'I' in its satvic state, or something.
So, this 'I' feeling is the one that is moving.
Then that which is aware of the extreme play, - the swings of 'I' - the oscillations of 'I' - that is beyond 'I' itself, isn't it?

That's fantastic.
Well now you've learned what I think is quite possibly one of the most useful concepts in life, and you might already be familiar with it, but if you're not this will hopefully keep you from one day filing for bankruptcy.
So anyway, I will talk about interest, and then simple versus compound interest.
So what's interest?
We all have heard of it.
I'm going to speak today about the relationship between science and human values.
Now, it's generally understood that questions of morality -- questions of good and evil and right and wrong -- are questions about which science officially has no opinion.
It's thought that science can help us get what we value, but it can never tell us what we ought to value.
And, consequently, most people -- I think most people probably here -- think that science will never answer the most important questions in human life: questions like, "What is worth living for?"
"What is worth dying for?"
"What constitutes a good life?"
So, I'm going to argue that this is an illusion -- that the separation between science and human values is an illusion -- and actually quite a dangerous one at this point in human history.
Now, it's often said that science cannot give us a foundation for morality and human values, because science deals with facts, and facts and values seem to belong to different spheres.
It's often thought that there's no description of the way the world is that can tell us how the world ought to be.
But I think this is quite clearly untrue.
Values are a certain kind of fact.
They are facts about the well-being of conscious creatures.
Why is it that we don't have ethical obligations toward rocks?
Why don't we feel compassion for rocks?
It's because we don't think rocks can suffer.
And if we're more concerned about our fellow primates than we are about insects, as indeed we are, it's because we think they're exposed to a greater range of potential happiness and suffering.
Now, the crucial thing to notice here is that this is a factual claim:
This is something that we could be right or wrong about.
And if we have misconstrued the relationship between biological complexity and the possibilities of experience well then we could be wrong about the inner lives of insects.
And there's no notion, no version of human morality and human values that I've ever come across that is not at some point reducible to a concern about conscious experience and its possible changes.
Even if you get your values from religion, even if you think that good and evil ultimately relate to conditions after death -- either to an eternity of happiness with God or an eternity of suffering in hell -- you are still concerned about consciousness and its changes.
And to say that such changes can persist after death is itself a factual claim, which, of course, may or may not be true.
Now, to speak about the conditions of well-being in this life, for human beings, we know that there is a continuum of such facts.
We know that it's possible to live in a failed state, where everything that can go wrong does go wrong -- where mothers cannot feed their children, where strangers cannot find the basis for peaceful collaboration, where people are murdered indiscriminately.
And we know that it's possible to move along this continuum towards something quite a bit more idyilic, to a place where a conference like this is even conceivable.
And we know -- we know -- that there are right and wrong answers to how to move in this space.
Would adding cholera to the water be a good idea?
Probably not.
Would it be a good idea for everyone to believe in the evil eye, so that when bad things happened to them they immediately blame their neighbors?
Probably not.
There are truths to be known about how human communities flourish, whether or not we understand these truths.
And morality relates to these truths.
So, in talking about values we are talking about facts.
Now, of course our situation in the world can be understood at many levels -- from the level of the genome on up to the level of economic systems and political arrangements.
But if we're going to talk about human well-being we are, of necessity, talking about the human brain.
Because we know that our experience of the world and of ourselves within it is realized in the brain -- whatever happens after death.
Even if the suicide bomber does get 72 virgins in the afterlife, in this life, his personality -- his rather unfortunate personality -- is the product of his brain.
So the contributions of culture -- if culture changes us, as indeed it does, it changes us by changing our brains.
And so therefore whatever cultural variation there is in how human beings flourish can, at least in principle, be understood in the context of a maturing science of the mind -- neuroscience, psychology, etc.
So, what I'm arguing is that value's reduced to facts -- to facts about the conscious experience of conscious beings.
And we can therefore visualize a space of possible changes in the experience of these beings.
And I think of this as kind of a moral landscape, with peaks and valleys that correspond to differences in the well-being of conscious creatures, both personal and collective.
And one thing to notice is that perhaps there are states of human well-being that we rarely access, that few people access.
And these await our discovery.
Perhaps some of these states can be appropriately called mystical or spiritual.
Perhaps there are other states that we can't access because of how our minds are structured but other minds possibly could access them.
Now, let me be clear about what I'm not saying.
I'm not saying that science is guaranteed to map this space, or that we will have scientific answers to every conceivable moral question.
I don't think, for instance, that you will one day consult a supercomputer to learn whether you should have a second child, or whether we should bomb Iran's nuclear facilities, or whether you can deduct the full cost of TED as a business expense. (Laughter)
But if questions affect human well-being then they do have answers, whether or not we can find them.
And just admitting this -- just admitting that there are right and wrong answers to the question of how humans flourish -- will change the way we talk about morality, and will change our expectations of human cooperation in the future.
For instance, there are 21 states in our country where corporal punishment in the classroom is legal, where it is legal for a teacher to beat a child with a wooden board, hard, and raising large bruises and blisters and even breaking the skin. And hundreds of thousands of children, incidentally, are subjected to this every year.
The locations of these enlightened districts, I think, will fail to surprise you.
We're not talking about Connecticut.
And the rationale for this behavior is explicitly religious.
The creator of the universe himself has told us not to spare the rod, lest we spoil the child -- this is in Proverbs 13 and 20, and I believe, 23.
But we can ask the obvious question:
Is it a good idea, generally speaking, to subject children to pain and violence and public humiliation as a way of encouraging healthy emotional development and good behavior?
(Laughter)
Is there any doubt that this question has an answer, and that it matters?
Now, many of you might worry that the notion of well-being is truly undefined, and seemingly perpetually open to be re-construed.
And so, how therefore can there be an objective notion of well-being?
Well, consider by analogy, the concept of physical health.
The concept of physical health is undefined.
As we just heard from Michael Specter, it has changed over the years.
When this statue was carved the average life expectancy was probably 30.
It's now around 80 in the developed world.
There may come a time when we meddle with our genomes in such a way that not being able to run a marathon at age 200 will be considered a profound disability.
People will send you donations when you're in that condition.
(Laughter)
Notice that the fact that the concept of health is open, genuinely open for revision, does not make it vacuous.
The distinction between a healthy person and a dead one is about as clear and consequential as any we make in science.
Another thing to notice is there may be many peaks on the moral landscape:
There may be equivalent ways to thrive; there may be equivalent ways to organize a human society so as to maximize human flourishing.
Now, why wouldn't this undermine an objective morality?
Well think of how we talk about food:
I would never be tempted to argue to you that there must be one right food to eat.
There is clearly a range of materials that constitute healthy food.
But there's nevertheless a clear distinction between food and poison.
The fact that there are many right answers to the question, "What is food?" does not tempt us to say that there are no truths to be known about human nutrition.
Many people worry that a universal morality would require moral precepts that admit of no exceptions.
So, for instance, if it's really wrong to lie, it must always be wrong to lie, and if you can find an exception, well then there's no such thing as moral truth.
Why would we think this?
Consider, by analogy, the game of chess.
Now, if you're going to play good chess, a principle like, "Don't lose your Queen," is very good to follow.
But it clearly admits some exceptions.
There are moments when losing your Queen is a brilliant thing to do.
There are moments when it is the only good thing you can do.
And yet, chess is a domain of perfect objectivity.
The fact that there are exceptions here does not change that at all.
Now, this brings us to the sorts of moves that people are apt to make in the moral sphere.
Consider the great problem of women's bodies:
What to do about them?
Well this is one thing you can do about them:
You can cover them up.
Now, it is the position, generally speaking, of our intellectual community that while we may not like this, we might think of this as "wrong" in Boston or Palo Alto, who are we to say that the proud denizens of an ancient culture are wrong to force their wives and daughters to live in cloth bags?
And who are we to say, even, that they're wrong to beat them with lengths of steel cable, or throw battery acid in their faces if they decline the privilege of being smothered in this way?
Well, who are we not to say this?
Who are we to pretend that we know so little about human well-being that we have to be non-judgmental about a practice like this?
I'm not talking about voluntary wearing of a veil -- women should be able to wear whatever they want, as far as I'm concerned.
But what does voluntary mean in a community where, when a girl gets raped, her father's first impulse, rather often, is to murder her out of shame?
Just let that fact detonate in your brain for a minute:
Your daughter gets raped, and what you want to do is kill her.
What are the chances that represents a peak of human flourishing?
Now, to say this is not to say that we have got the perfect solution in our own society.
For instance, this is what it's like to go to a newsstand almost anywhere in the civilized world.
Now, granted, for many men it may require a degree in philosophy to see something wrong with these images.
(Laughter)
But if we are in a reflective mood, we can ask,
"Is this the perfect expression of psychological balance with respect to variables like youth and beauty and women's bodies?"
I mean, is this the optimal environment in which to raise our children?
OK, so perhaps there's some place on the spectrum between these two extremes that represents a place of better balance.
(Applause)
Perhaps there are many such places -- again, given other changes in human culture there may be many peaks on the moral landscape.
But the thing to notice is that there will be many more ways not to be on a peak.
Now the irony, from my perspective, is that the only people who seem to generally agree with me and who think that there are right and wrong answers to moral questions are religious demagogues of one form or another.
And of course they think they have right answers to moral questions because they got these answers from a voice in a whirlwind, not because they made an intelligent analysis of the causes and condition of human and animal well-being.
In fact, the endurance of religion as a lens through which most people view moral questions has separated most moral talk from real questions of human and animal suffering.
This is why we spend our time talking about things like gay marriage and not about genocide or nuclear proliferation or poverty or any other hugely consequential issue.
But the demagogues are right about one thing:
We need a universal conception of human values.
Now, what stands in the way of this?
Well, one thing to notice is that we do something different when talking about morality -- especially secular, academic, scientist types.
When talking about morality we value differences of opinion in a way that we don't in any other area of our lives.
So, for instance the Dalai Lama gets up every morning meditating on compassion, and he thinks that helping other human beings is an integral component of human happiness.
On the other hand, we have someone like Ted Bundy;
Ted Bundy was very fond of abducting and raping and torturing and killing young women.
So, we appear to have a genuine difference of opinion about how to profitably use one's time.
(Laughter)
Most Western intellectuals
look at this situation and say, "Well, there's nothing for the Dalai Lama to be really right about -- really right about -- or for Ted Bundy to be really wrong about that admits of a real argument that potentially falls within the purview of science.
He likes chocolate, he likes vanilla.
There's nothing that one should be able to say to the other that should persuade the other."
Notice that we don't do this in science.
On the left you have Edward Witten.
He's a string theorist.
If you ask the smartest physicists around who is the smartest physicist around, in my experience half of them will say Ed Witten.
The other half will tell you they don't like the question.
(Laughter)
So, what would happen if I showed up at a physics conference and said,"String theory is bogus.
It doesn't resonate with me. It's not how I chose to view the universe at a small scale.
I'm not a fan."
(Laughter)
Well, nothing would happen because I'm not a physicist;
I don't understand string theory.
I'm the Ted Bundy of string theory. (Laughter)
I wouldn't want to belong to any string theory club that would have me as a member.
But this is just the point.
Whenever we are talking about facts certain opinions must be excluded.
That is what it is to have a domain of expertise.
That is what it is for knowledge to count.
How have we convinced ourselves that in the moral sphere there is no such thing as moral expertise, or moral talent, or moral genius even?
How have we convinced ourselves that every opinion has to count?
How have we convinced ourselves that every culture has a point of view on these subjects worth considering?
Does the Taliban have a point of view on physics that is worth considering? No.
(Laughter)
How is their ignorance any less obvious on the subject of human well-being?
(Applause)
So, this, I think, is what the world needs now.
It needs people like ourselves to admit that there are right and wrong answers to questions of human flourishing, and morality relates to that domain of facts.
It is possible for individuals, and even for whole cultures, to care about the wrong things, which is to say that it's possible for them to have beliefs and desires that reliably lead to needless human suffering.
Just admitting this will transform our discourse about morality.
We live in a world in which the boundaries between nations mean less and less, and they will one day mean nothing.
We live in a world filled with destructive technology, and this technology cannot be uninvented; it will always be easier to break things than to fix them.
It seems to me, therefore, patently obvious that we can no more respect and tolerate vast differences in notions of human well-being than we can respect or tolerate vast differences in the notions about how disease spreads, or in the safety standards of buildings and airplanes.
We simply must converge on the answers we give to the most important questions in human life.
And to do that, we have to admit that these questions have answers.
Thank you very much.
(Applause)
Chris Anderson:
So, some combustible material there.
Whether in this audience or people elsewhere in the world, hearing some of this, may well be doing the screaming-with-rage thing, after as well, some of them.
Language seems to be really important here.
When you're talking about the veil, you're talking about women dressed in cloth bags.
I've lived in the Muslim world, spoken with a lot of Muslim women.
And some of them would say something else. They would say,
"No, you know, this is a celebration of female specialness, it helps build that and it's a result of the fact that" -- and this is arguably a sophisticated psychological view --
"that male lust is not to be trusted."
I mean, can you engage in a conversation with that kind of woman without seeming kind of cultural imperialist?
Yeah, well I think I tried to broach this in a sentence, watching the clock ticking, but the question is:
What is voluntary in a context where men have certain expectations, and you're guaranteed to be treated in a certain way if you don't veil yourself?
And so, if anyone in this room wanted to wear a veil, or a very funny hat, or tattoo their face --
I think we should be free to voluntarily do whatever we want, but we have to be honest about the constraints that these women are placed under.
And so I think we shouldn't be so eager to always take their word for it, especially when it's 120 degrees out and you're wearing a full burqa.
A lot of people want to believe in this concept of moral progress.
But can you reconcile that?
I think I understood you to say that you could reconcile that with a world that doesn't become one dimensional, where we all have to think the same.
Paint your picture of what rolling the clock 50 years forward, 100 years forward, how you would like to think of the world, balancing moral progress with richness.
SH: Well, I think once you admit that we are on the path toward understanding our minds at the level of the brain in some important detail, then you have to admit that we are going to understand all of the positive and negative qualities of ourselves in much greater detail.
So, we're going to understand positive social emotion like empathy and compassion, and we're going to understand the factors that encourage it -- whether they're genetic, whether they're how people talk to one another, whether they're economic systems, and insofar as we begin to shine light on that we are inevitably going to converge on that fact space.
So, everything is not going to be up for grabs.
It's not going to be like veiling my daughter from birth is just as good as teaching her to be confident and well-educated in the context of men who do desire women.
I mean I don't think we need an NSF grant to know that compulsory veiling is a bad idea -- but at a certain point we're going to be able to scan the brains of everyone involved and actually interrogate them.
Do people love their daughters just as much in these systems?
And I think there are clearly right answers to that.
CA:
And if the results come out that actually they do, are you prepared to shift your instinctive current judgment on some of these issues?
SH:
Well yeah, modulo one obvious fact, that you can love someone in the context of a truly delusional belief system.
So, you can say like, "Because I knew my gay son was going to go to hell if he found a boyfriend, I chopped his head off.
And that was the most compassionate thing I could do."
If you get all those parts aligned, yes I think you could probably be feeling the emotion of love.
But again, then we have to talk about well-being in a larger context.
It's all of us in this together, not one man feeling ecstasy and then blowing himself up on a bus.
Sam, this is a conversation I would actually love to continue for hours.
We don't have that, but maybe another time.
Thank you for coming to TED.
SH:
Really an honor.
Thank you.
On the 4th of July, 2011 we posted a request online to participate in a short film about interdependence.
Artwork and videos emerged from around the world.
Here is what unfolded...
When in the course of human events... It becomes increasingly necessary to recognize the fundamental qualities that connect us.
Then we must reevaluate the truths we hold to be self evident.
That all humans are created equal and all are connected
That all humans are created equal and all are connected.
That we share the pursuits of life liberty happiness food water shelter safety education justice and hopes for a better future.
That our collective knowledge economy technology and environment are fundamentally interdependent.
Interdependent.
That what will propel us forward as a species is our curiosity our ability to forgive our ability to appreciate our courage and our desire to connect.
That these things we share will ultimately help us evolve to our fullest common potential.
And whereas we should take our problems seriously we should never take ourselves too seriously
Because another thing that connects us is our ability to laugh and our attempt to learn from our mistakes.
So that we can learn from the past understand our place in the world and use our collective knowledge to create a better future
So perhaps it's time that we as a species who love to laugh ask questions and connect do something radical and true.
For centuries we have declared independence
Perhaps it's now time that we as humans declare our interdependence
Interdependence

When I was a child, I always wanted to be a superhero.
I wanted to save the world and make everyone happy.
But I knew that I'd need superpowers to make my dreams come true.
So I used to embark on these imaginary journeys to find intergalactic objects from planet Krypton, which was a lot of fun, but didn't yield much result.
When I grew up and realized that science fiction was not a good source for superpowers, I decided instead to embark on a journey of real science, to find a more useful truth.
I started my journey in California, with a UC Berkeley 30-year longitudinal study that examined the photos of students in an old yearbook, and tried to measure their success and well-being throughout their life.
By measuring the students' smiles, researchers were able to predict how fulfilling and long-lasting a subject's marriage would be, (Laughter) how well she would score on standardized tests of well-being, and how inspiring she would be to others.
In another yearbook, I stumbled upon Barry Obama's picture.
When I first saw his picture, I thought that his superpowers came from his super collar.
(Laughter) But now I know it was all in his smile.
Another aha! moment came from a 2010 Wayne State University research project that looked into pre-1950s baseball cards of Major League players.
The researchers found that the span of a player's smile could actually predict the span of his life.
Players who didn't smile in their pictures lived an average of only 72.9 years, where players with beaming smiles lived an average of almost 80 years.
(Laughter)
The good news is that we're actually born smiling.
Using 3D ultrasound technology, we can now see that developing babies appear to smile, even in the womb.
When they're born, babies continue to smile -- initially, mostly in their sleep.
And even blind babies smile to the sound of the human voice.
Smiling is one of the most basic, biologically uniform expressions of all humans.
In studies conducted in Papua New Guinea, Paul Ekman, the world's most renowned researcher on facial expressions, found that even members of the Fore tribe, who were completely disconnected from Western culture, and also known for their unusual cannibalism rituals, (Laughter) attributed smiles to descriptions of situations the same way you and I would.
So from Papua New Guinea to Hollywood all the way to modern art in Beijing, we smile often, and use smiles to express joy and satisfaction.
How many people here in this room smile more than 20 times per day?
Raise your hand if you do.
Oh, wow.
Outside of this room, more than a third of us smile more than 20 times per day, whereas less than 14 percent of us smile less than five.
In fact, those with the most amazing superpowers are actually children, who smile as many as 400 times per day.
Have you ever wondered why being around children, who smile so frequently, makes you smile very often?
A recent study at Uppsala University in Sweden found that it's very difficult to frown when looking at someone who smiles.
You ask why?
Because smiling is evolutionarily contagious, and it suppresses the control we usually have on our facial muscles.
Mimicking a smile and experiencing it physically helps us understand whether our smile is fake or real, so we can understand the emotional state of the smiler.
In a recent mimicking study at the University of Clermont-Ferrand in France, subjects were asked to determine whether a smile was real or fake while holding a pencil in their mouth to repress smiling muscles.
Without the pencil, subjects were excellent judges, but with the pencil in their mouth -- when they could not mimic the smile they saw -- their judgment was impaired.
(Laughter)
In addition to theorizing on evolution in "The Origin of Species," Charles Darwin also wrote the facial feedback response theory.
His theory states that the act of smiling itself actually makes us feel better, rather than smiling being merely a result of feeling good.
In his study, Darwin actually cited a French neurologist, Guillaume Duchenne, who sent electric jolts to facial muscles to induce and stimulate smiles.
Please, don't try this at home.
(Laughter)
In a related German study, researchers used fMRI imaging to measure brain activity before and after injecting Botox to suppress smiling muscles.
The finding supported Darwin's theory, by showing that facial feedback modifies the neural processing of emotional content in the brain, in a way that helps us feel better when we smile.
Smiling stimulates our brain reward mechanism in a way that even chocolate -- a well-regarded pleasure inducer -- cannot match.
British researchers found that one smile can generate the same level of brain stimulation as up to 2,000 bars of chocolate.
(Laughter)
Wait -- The same study found that smiling is as stimulating as receiving up to 16,000 pounds sterling in cash.
(Laughter) That's like 25 grand a smile.
It's not bad.
And think about it this way:
25,000 times 400 -- quite a few kids out there feel like Mark Zuckerberg every day. (Laughter)
And unlike lots of chocolate, lots of smiling can actually make you healthier.
Smiling can help reduce the level of stress-enhancing hormones like cortisol, adrenaline and dopamine, increase the level of mood-enhancing hormones like endorphins, and reduce overall blood pressure.
And if that's not enough, smiling can actually make you look good in the eyes of others.
A recent study at Penn State University found that when you smile, you don't only appear to be more likable and courteous, but you actually appear to be more competent.
So whenever you want to look great and competent, reduce your stress or improve your marriage, or feel as if you just had a whole stack of high-quality chocolate without incurring the caloric cost, or as if you found 25 grand in a pocket of an old jacket you hadn't worn for ages, or whenever you want to tap into a superpower that will help you and everyone around you live a longer, healthier, happier life, smile.
(Applause)
I've been intrigued by this question of whether we could evolve or develop a sixth sense -- a sense that would give us seamless access and easy access to meta-information or information that may exist somewhere that may be relevant to help us make the right decision about whatever it is that we're coming across.
And some of you may argue, "Well, don't today's cell phones do that already?"
But I would say no.
When you meet someone here at TED -- and this is the top networking place, of course, of the year -- you don't shake somebody's hand and then say, "Can you hold on for a moment while I take out my phone and Google you?"
Or when you go to the supermarket and you're standing there in that huge aisle of different types of toilet papers, you don't take out your cell phone, and open a browser, and go to a website to try to decide which of these different toilet papers is the most ecologically responsible purchase to make.
So we don't really have easy access to all this relevant information that can just help us make optimal decisions about what to do next and what actions to take.
And so my research group at the Media Lab has been developing a series of inventions to give us access to this information in a sort of easy way, without requiring that the user changes any of their behavior.
And I'm here to unveil our latest effort, and most successful effort so far, which is still very much a work in process.
I'm actually wearing the device right now and we've sort of cobbled it together with components that are off the shelf -- and that, by the way, only cost 350 dollars at this point in time.
I'm wearing a camera, just a simple web cam, a portable, battery-powered projection system with a little mirror.
These components communicate to my cell phone in my pocket which acts as the communication and computation device.
And in the video here we see my student Pranav Mistry, who's really the genius who's been implementing and designing this whole system.
And we see how this system lets him walk up to any surface and start using his hands to interact with the information that is projected in front of him.
The system tracks the four significant fingers.
In this case, he's wearing simple marker caps that you may recognize.
But if you want a more stylish version, you could also paint your nails in different colors.
And the camera basically tracks these four fingers and recognizes any gestures that he's making so he can just go to, for example, a map of Long Beach, zoom in and out, etc.
The system also recognizes iconic gestures such as the "take a picture" gesture, and then takes a picture of whatever is in front of you.
And when he then walks back to the Media Lab, he can just go up to any wall and project all the pictures that he's taken, sort through them and organize them, and re-size them, etc., again using all natural gestures.
So, some of you most likely were here two years ago and saw the demo by Jeff Han, or some of you may think, "Well, doesn't this look like the Microsoft Surface Table?"
And yes, you also interact using natural gestures, both hands, etc.
But the difference here is that you can use any surface, you can walk up to any surface, including your hand, if nothing else is available, and interact with this projected data.
The device is completely portable, and can be -- (Applause) (Applause ends)
So, one important difference is that it's totally mobile.
Another even more important difference is that in mass production, this would not cost more tomorrow than today's cell phones and would actually not sort of be a bigger packaging -- could look a lot more stylish than this version that I'm wearing around my neck.
But other than letting some of you live out your fantasy of looking as cool as Tom Cruise in "Minority Report," the reason why we're really excited about this device is that it really can act as one of these sixth-sense devices that gives you relevant information about whatever is in front of you.
So we see Pranav here going into the supermarket and he's shopping for some paper towels.
And, as he picks up a product, the system can recognize the product that he's picking up, using either image recognition or marker technology, and give him the green light or an orange light.
He can ask for additional information.
So this particular choice here is a particularly good choice, given his personal criteria.
Some of you may want the toilet paper with the most bleach in it rather than the most ecologically responsible choice.
(Laughter)
If he picks up a book in the bookstore, he can get an Amazon rating -- it gets projected right on the cover of the book.
This is Juan's book, our previous speaker, which gets a great rating, by the way, at Amazon.
And so, Pranav turns the page of the book and can then see additional information about the book -- reader comments, maybe sort of information by his favorite critic, etc.
If he turns to a particular page, he finds an annotation by maybe an expert or a friend of ours that gives him a little bit of additional information about whatever is on that particular page.
Reading the newspaper -- it never has to be outdated.
(Laughter)
You can get video annotations of the events that you're reading about.
You can get the latest sports scores, etc.
This is a more controversial one.
(Laughter)
As you interact with someone at TED, maybe you can see a word cloud of the tags, the words that are associated with that person in their blog and personal web pages.
In this case, the student is interested in cameras, etc.
On your way to the airport, if you pick up your boarding pass, it can tell you that your flight is delayed, that the gate has changed, etc.
And, if you need to know what the current time is, it's as simple as drawing a watch -- (Laughter) (Applause) on your arm.
So that's where we're at so far in developing this sixth sense that would give us seamless access to all this relevant information about the things that we may come across.
My student Pranav, who's really, like I said, the genius behind this.
(Applause and cheering) (Applause ends)
He does deserve a lot of applause, because I don't think he's slept much in the last three months, actually.
And his girlfriend is probably not very happy about him either.
But it's not perfect yet, it's very much a work in progress.
And who knows, maybe in another 10 years we'll be here with the ultimate sixth sense brain implant.
Thank you.
(Applause)
Go ahead tell to attorney what happened. They forced me.
The case is strong. The case is strong. The case is strong.

Episode 14
What are you doing here?
I...am going to move out.
I'm going to get in your way.
It's a relief that Joon Gu works so hard.
My dad likes him a lot too.
Now, I should help my father at his restaurant with Joon Gu.
You like him?
Bong Joon Gu?
Of course I do. He liked only me for 4 years.
If someone says they like you, then you just like them like that too?
Why?
I can't do that?
I'm tired of having a crush now.
I want to see a guy that likes me.
I like Joon Gu.
You... like me.
You can't like anyone but me.
What is this, that confidence? Am I not right?
Yes, you're right!
I only like you.
So what am I supposed to do?
You don't ever see me. Someone like me...
Don't say that you like another guy.
That's the second one.
Second what?
Kiss...
It's the third.
It's fine.
I'm not going to count any more. Okay.
It's still not that time.
They're kids.
There is no need for that.
Just because there are marriage talks, doesn't mean anything is going to happen right away.
It will be uncomfortable, no, I'm the one who is uncomfortable.
Gi Dong-shii !
Thanks for what you've done. Twice already...
I will definitely pay you back.
Hyung!
Oh dear!
What happened to you two?
You'll catch a cold. Hurry, go upstairs and get changed. Yes.
Hyung!
Oh Ha Ni is going to move out.
I have something to say.
To me? Well, get changed first, then. . . I . . . want to marry Oh Ha Ni.
Seung Jo... Of course, not right away, but after we graduate, and Father's company is in a better state, if you were to approve, Father. A... are you being serious now?
Ha Ni! It really turned out well! This is great!
Ha Ni! I knew it would be like this. You didn't go to sleep?
"What if you go back to being the cold Baek Seung Jo?" That is what I was thinking. Then, do you want us to sleep together tonight?
Shh! &lt;i&gt;Don't be like this... Joon Gu... &lt;i&gt;Hey, don't. &lt;i&gt;I told you to not do this Joon Gu! Why did I do that?!
Joon Gu, really, what is wrong with you? You're not sleeping?
Ha Ni... I did wrong yesterday. Eat this and forgive me, okay?
Hey Joon Gu!
Why are you here already?
Oh Chef, did you go to the morning market?
Yeah, that's right.
But what is all of this?
This early in the morning?
Why are you packing a lunch?
Hey, there are even chicken wings.
I was preparing it to give to Ha Ni.
Ha Ni?
Ah, yes.
Actually, I ... to Ha Ni ...
It's nothing!
This is so fancy.
They've got titles to them too.
This is sweetened with honey so it's called "Oh Ha Ni."
Oh.
Ha.
Ni.
The focus of this one is the fried chicken wings so it's called, "Bong Joon Gu!"
Oh Ha Ni, Bong Joon Gu
How about we make a Sok Pal Book Lunch box?
Sok Pal Book Lunch box?
Ah, let me think about it.
Yes!
Oh Ha Ni~ Bong Joon Gu~ !
Done.
What? Is this a joke?
It's the truth!
He said it right in front of all of the adults!
Baek Seung Jo?
Not Bong Joon Gu?
Yeah.
Why?
Why does he want to marry you suddenly?
I'm not sure.
Maybe he finally realized my feelings.
He found out it was love.
A story like that.
Then are you going to get married right away?
It's still far away Not before we graduate.
Wow, Oh Ha Ni, that's great!
Hey!
I want to make you my life's mentor!
What's wrong with you!
Anyway, Congratulations The crush you had for 4 years is finally paying off!
So you finally did it!
Congrats!
Thanks.
You like it that much?!
Yeah, she's loving it!
Ah, then... what about Bong Joon Gu?
Ah, right.
And Yoon Hae Ra...?
Seung Jo said he's gonna tell Hae Ra.
And I have to tell Joon Gu.
Oh Ha Ni? &lt;i&gt; Oh Ha Ni / Baek Seung Jo After 4 years of passionate love, finally the engagement.
I wonder who confessed first?
It must be Oh Ha Ni.
It came faster than I thought
I knew that someday you would figure out your true feelings, but this day came sooner than I thought.
I didn't know either that this was going to happen.
Did you know?
Your mother knew too, didn't she?
Oh Ha Ni was really difficult.
It was like solving a problem with no answer.
That's why it was so hard.
But you didn't want to admit that, right?
That Baek Seung Jo had a problem that, no matter how hard he tried, he couldn't find an answer to.
How come you know me so well?
But now it isn't hard anymore?
It was hard when I was trying not to be shaken by those feelings
But when I admitted, "I've completely given up to this kid."
Once I surrendered to that, it's not hard any more.
Now it's fun.
Hey!
You came to apologize, but aren't you just bragging too much?
Is that so?
Okay. I'm sincerely apologizing.
But I wasn't joking around.
I really thought we two would match well.
When I was with you, I was really comfortable.
You were running away from Oh Ha Ni and finding comfort in me right?
I'm sorry.
You're not saying you weren't.
But what to do?
"I'm fine." I can't say that.
Scared?
Okay.
I've accepted it.
Congratutlations on your marriage.
It's still far away!
I'm congratulating you early then.
Okay.
What is this?
I'm trying to throw away my feelings.
Why is your hand so warm?
You're really a nice girl.
I know.
Joon Gu, let's eat.
I don't feel like it.
Go ahead.
Does a person working in the cafeteria bother to think about eating?
While we're not busy we have to eat and clean up.
Hurry and come.
Oh, what's that?
It looks like a lunch box.
Is he saying he doesn't feel like it since he brought his lunch?
- Hey, is this octopus or rice cake?
- It's rice cake!
Look at the way he wrapped this meat?!
I bet it's delicious!
It's really delicious!
I'm being truly honest when I say this... apart from how Bong looks...
I can't believe it's to this point!
I would pay over 10 times to eat this.
I feel the same way.
It's so good.
Joon Gu you could sell this right away!
Quit that noodle place and let's open up a lunch box shop?!
What do you think?!
Ha Ni, have you eaten?
I don't know.
I should have told him in person first.
I left after what happened last night too.
Did Seung Jo tell her yet?
It seemed like Hae Ra really liked Seung Jo a lot, too.
That's probably why she was like that to me.
Why is dating so difficult?
"Oh Ha Ni, Baek Seung Jo"?!
"After 4 years of passionate love, finally the engagement"?!
What does this Oh Ha Ni look like?! What does she look like that she was able to accomplish this feat?!
That's freaking amazing!
But she's so ugly, she's really ugly!
I like you. &lt;i&gt;Let's just take a chance, &lt;i&gt;on each other. &lt;i&gt;Let's... start. &lt;i&gt; You're a really fine woman. Where are the beverages?
Ah, yeah.
She must be really thirsty.
I have to know what she likes so that I can buy it.
Water?
No, not water.
It's not cold!
Oh this is cold, this is cold!
I don't even know if she likes that.
A drink like this?!
Just because she was exercising doesn't mean I can give her a sports drink! Coke, Coke, Coke!
Ah, right, Diet Coke.
That would imply that she has to lose weight.
There's nothing for her to lose!
What should I buy?
Excuse me!
When you're really thirsty, what do you like to drink?
Yoon Hae Ra, why are you like this, really?
Are you okay? Beer?
It was cool, earlier on...
Fine.
I'm thirsty.
Why won't this open!
Should I open it up for you?
It's fine.
Ah.
It's really annoying.
It's okay if you sob,
I'm okay with it.
Don't hold it back.
Ha Ni, I really wanted to do this together with you.
You are my life's navigation system
You guide me through the paths I have to.. to take.
Yes, Chef!
I'm out for some fresh air now .
Yes, I understand.
I'll be coming back now.
Make sure to clean up nicely before you go in.
I understand
Great job.
You came!
Good thing you came.
Chef left his wallet.
Where was it...Oh here it is.
Here.
Wallet?
The colour is pretty.
What is it?
Chlorella.
Joon Gu, I ...
I have something to say.
I'm sorry, but today you have to go home. I'm really busy.
Bong Joon Gu.
Let's have a talk.
You must be kidding.
What do I have to talk with you about?
Just go.
Then I'll say it right here.
I...
like Oh Ha Ni.
We don't need your permission to date, but it's important for Ha Ni.
It would be good if you let it go.
If you let her go, everything will be fine.
Hey!
That's something stupid to say.
Let go... let go of what?
Hey Baek Seung Jo.
All this time you've been so mean to Ha Ni.
Now what are you trying to say?
It seems like you don't know, but for 4 years, I liked Ha Ni.
Joon Gu.
I'm sorry.
Why are you sorry?
Of course I'm sorry and thankful.
But I really...
It's fine.
Don't say it.
I already know.
I already saw it.
Ah Oh Ha Ni, really...
You really have no taste in guys.
Later,even if you regret it,
I'm not going to give in.
Will you be okay with that?
See?
You can't even respond quickly enough.
Baek Seung Jo.
What are you going to do?
Ha Ni isn't able to respond.
Yeah.
I'm getting nervous.
Seung Jo.
Just know that I'm always going to be watching you.
If you make tears come out of Ha Ni's eyes,
I'll make bloody tears come out of your eyes.
I'll keep that in mind. &lt;i&gt;Brought to you by the PKer team @ www.viki.com
What is this?
Get in.
What car is this?
It's a company car. I'm using it for now.
It just didn't feel right in my father's car.
Wow... it's nice!
Then should we go driving?
Don't think like that. This car is for company use only.
Here.
Something to eat while you drink.
Chef...
Yes, Joon Gu?
You know, I ... wanted to call you Father.
I truly wanted to call you "Father-in-law."
My father-in-law.
I'm really sorry about what happened with your grand daughter.
It's all my fault.
Collapsing and all.
Seung Jo may be reliable, but he's still very young.
He's not ...
You don't need to beat around the bush.
My investment was on the line, and since that all happened, my investment is no longer there.
It's simple.
But still... the game is almost complete and you really enjoyed it...
I'm not that great of a person.
I can't separate how I feel and what I'm supposed to do!
Since there was interest, the game is probably liked.
Seung Jo!
Did you come to witness the punishment for yourself?
No. I settled the matter with your granddaughter myself.
Today, I came to talk about business.
Seung Jo.
What?!
Saying sorry for what happened, I don't think Hae Ra would want that.
For whatever reason, putting herself in a hurtful position... a position to accept an apology, I don't think she'd like it.
I have a similar personality so I know her quite well.
So?
You're not going to apologize for Hae Ra but you still want me to invest?
Yes.
Seung Jo!
Please invest, but you don't necessarily need to invest in our company.
Our game, we can pass it on to a different company, or your company can service it completely.
Wherever it may be, please allow us to have game service.
For the last 2 months our employees have worked day and night, even forgoing their paychecks.
They worked very hard, and the results came out nicely.
It's fine if you throw out our company, but please at least allow this game to see the spotlight, and please save our developers.
To give up on those below me because you dislike me... It's childish?
You're teaching me right now, aren't you?
It's not that.
Baek Seung Jo! I don't like you.
I'm very sorry.
You should at least plead for something.
Invest in us or it's the end for us.
I did wrong with Hae Ra. Please forgive me.
You need to plead like that, rascal.
That way I'll waver and sign the contract.
Idiot. &lt;i&gt;Yes, President?
Bring the stamp (used to sign contracts).
Thank you very much.
You can't mooch off my money.
Pay me back multiples.
Yes, I'll do that.
Thank you.
Thank you.
So the launch is next week?
Yes.
As long as there are no problems.
Seung Jo you're amazing.
I'm really indebted to you this time.
I was very surprised.
Made me wonder whether you are really my son.
You're cool.
But you can't brag in front of me.
Do you think I've been through this only once or twice?
Yes, it must have been like that.
Yes that's why you should quit now.
You did enough so you can stop.
It's time for you to pick a major for next year. You have to go to med school.
But there's no guarantee that this game will be successful.
Then we'll just be in debt. And your health...
I just told you not to brag!
I'm fairly famous in the gaming industry within our country! Don't you try to overstep me!
Seung Jo, don't you dare steal my place.
I'm going to do this for the next 20 years.
20 years?
And after that?
I'm here!
I'm better at gaming than my brother.
He doesn't like games, and he doesn't like them.
If I work hard from now on, I can become a great heir.
So, Seung jo, become a doctor. Become a doctor and help NoRi.
No Ri is sick again.
I saved this nearly collapsing company, but seems I've been instantly kicked out.
Yes, as soon as this new game launches, let's shoot him off to med school!
Poor you...
There isn't a day where your hands are normal.
Lately I always hurt myself because of the cutting exercises.
And this one I was curling...
Did you say the qualification test was next month?
When I finish school, you two have to buy me a set of scissors (hair cutting)
But that's expensive.
Buy it anyway! That's what people get when they graduate! You two start saving your money.
Got it! I'll have to take on a part-time job.
Then buy me a tablet.
What's a tablet?
There's this thing you use to draw when using a computer.
Ah, Min Ah I saw your webtoon!
"Pitpatting Parang High." It was totally about us! It was so amusing.
Hey, what are you?
You drew me like that, am I that fat?!
Why? The feedback was really good.
Hey, in her webtoon your character is the most popular.
Really?
Dok Go Min Ah, are you going to become a famous cartoonist then?
Looks like I'll have to get a signature. Hurry up and give me a signature.
Hurry!
The game we are launching this month is a new MMORPG with realistic visual action aspects to it.
We will be implementing real time play within the existing market, which will make a big impact and change the way games are played.
It's a taste of a game that none other possesses with focus on animation like graphics.
Then, we'll start now.
These days online games are exported just as much as cars, maybe more, and therefore quality has gone down causing concern.
But a new game was released that could be the new face of this declining industry.
Within this gaming industry that's filled with games that require boring time commitments and nothing more than extravagant graphics..
We have created a fun animation game that is easy to enjoy.
As expected!
Isn't he fine, Grandfather?
Yeah. He is desirable.
Of course! Would I have liked a trivial person?
It's in past tense.
Then, have you cleared up your feelings?
You were really upset over it.
Seeing him again, I'm getting greedy again.
Ah, how tiring.
Joon Gu, it's a favor.
Joon Gu, hurry with the dishes...
Cut up some scallions, and cook some more noodles.
Yes, I understand.
Right Baek Seung Jo. Let's try our best.
You can enjoy all aspects of action with our game.
Hey, you being around motivates me even more.
Just wait and see. I'll become a great person too.
On the Internet, the feedback from the game is explosive.
Even if he is my son, Seung Jo is really amazing.
Ha Ni, I saw the webtoon Min Ah put on the Internet.
It was so funny.
Isn't it?
Lately that webtoon has been really popular.
I think in good time she should be amongst some of the most popular cartoonists.
That's great.
I know.
I'm so happy for her.
I see because she's so talented she's already making a name for herself.
I hear getting a job for university grads is real hard these days so they're interviewing like crazy. Good for her.
Despite these hard times I hear there are tons of students that don't give a care in the world.
That friend of yours must be working really hard.
Yes, they're working hard
That doesn't "care for a thing" student, we have one at our house too.
You...again!
Oh, Ha Ni, something came from the school for you
Eun Jo, give me that thing on the very top over there.
Here.
Yes.
What is it?
What is it?
Report card...
Huh?
It's probably obvious.
What do I do!?
I calculated my credits and was reassured. I thought it was okay.
I don't have enough credits.
Then the credits on there were probably calculated incorrectly.
Huh?
It seems like it.
What do I do?
If you don't have enough credits, then you have to push through again.
There's no use in coming to me and crying.
You caused these results by yourself, so you're the only one that can take care of this.
Yes.
I know that much.
Then, it is fine.
Excuse me...
I think I'm just no good at studying
Should I just give up school?
I tried on my own.
It seems like my grades aren't going up.
Because if you do that then you could spend a bit more time following me around?
It's not exactly like that.
What about when everyone around you was studying like crazy to get good grades so they could get a job?
What were you doing?
Have you thought about your future career?
You don't think things through enough and that's why your calculations are wrong, and your credits don't add up.
Baek Seung Jo!
Am I wrong?
You don't know my feelings.
You're good at everything without even trying whether it's grades or sports.
You're popular with girls
Baek Seung Jo, you don't understand others' struggles.
Someone like you can't understand my feelings.
If you didn't have perseverance what would be left of you?
Then you... don't have any charm.
You were this cold of a person,
Baek Seung Jo.
Where are you going?
Wherever
Is there even a place for you to go this late at night?
I have.
I might just go to a different guy!
So you have that kind of courage?
Bong Joong Gu or...
Kyung Su sunbae?
Even if you regret it later, I won't care.
Do as you wish. &lt;i&gt;You are too much Baek Seung Jo!&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;I'm already upset because of my credits, &lt;i&gt;and you stepped all over that. &lt;i&gt;As happy as I am, I still get hurt too. &lt;i&gt;All I wanted was for you to comfort me a bit. &lt;i&gt;Cold blooded Baek Seung Jo!
What did you say to Ha Ni?
She's the kind of girl who didn't give up, even when you were so mean to her.
Tell me. What did you say to her?
What could you have said to make her leave?
She probably went to her friends.
Besides, I didn't say much.
I just gave her some motivation because it seemed like she was given an academic warning.
You really.
I thought you were doing well.
Why are you like that again?
This is a good chance.
She needs to be apart from me a little, so that she can think for herself.
Joo Ri!
Oh!
Ha Ni!
Why are you here at this time?
I . . .
left the house.
What?
Yah!
You failed one of your classes, didn't you?
So you fought with Baek Seung Jo?
Lovers' quarrel?
Hey!
I'm not in the mood for joking!
Even if you're really mad, who would just leave the house like that?
He'll probably come get her.
Really?
I don't know It's been a long time we had such good beer, let's drink up!
Right!
Drink up!!
Don't worry and just drink.
You can spend the night at my place.
Thank you. &lt;i&gt; Did Seung Jo already go to sleep? &lt;i&gt;No, that is not possible. &lt;i&gt; Because I left like that, he must be worried and not able to sleep. &lt;i&gt; Would he come looking for me? &lt;i&gt; Should I send him a message to let him know at least where I am? &lt;i&gt; No matter how, it seems like I overreacted &lt;i&gt; saying I'll go to another man. &lt;i&gt; He'll come to get me tomorrow, right? &lt;i&gt;He's probably reflecting, right? &lt;i&gt; Baek Seung Jo, &lt;i&gt; I'm lonely without you. &lt;i&gt;It's upsetting but . . . &lt;i&gt; I miss you, Seung Jo!
Really?
Yeah.
Oh Ha Ni, it looks like you didn't sleep well.
If you miss Seung Jo, just go back home.
I can't give in first now that I've come this far.
It's a good chance to make Seung Jo realize how large my presence was.
I can't keep on being the only one saying I like him.
Aigoo, Oh Ha Ni!
Only now did you return to your senses?
I have to go now. I'll be late.
Bye!
Fighting!
Work hard.
Call me.
Bye!
Right, you thought well.
You should be able to do that too.
But how is Seung Jo doing?
Should I take a small look from afar?
Oh Ha Ni!
Why?
It's fun!
To see Baek Seung Jo's struggling face because he misses me.
Let's go, okay?
He's over there.
He looks like he's having fun.
He's not struggling at all.
I'm definitely not going back home!
Never ever!
Are you sighing again?
Ha Ni left yesterday and hasn't called.
I am back!
Oh, you're here early!
What about Ha Ni?
Did you find her?
No.
How about putting an end to this and bringing her back home?
Ha Ni is also just being stubborn right now.
She wants to come back but hasn't had the chance, so she's having a hard time.
You don't even know that?
How can someone be that cold?
Oh poor Ha Ni!
Ah let's just leave them.
After all, it's something that concerns only them.
Won't something good come out of Ha Ni being apart for a little while?
If Gi Dong shi says that too, then what are we going to do?
Ha Ni!
She's only been gone one day and I miss her this much.
I'm sorry. My family came all of a sudden. You're going home, right?
Huh?
Don't be like that and just go back home.
He might have been a little harsh, but I think he said all that for your own good.
Go home.
Okay.
You go back in first.
I am sorry Ha Ni.
Cheer up!
Yes.
I'm going.
Go back in first.
They're waiting for you.
Huh?
I'm going.
Go back home.
Ok.
I love you!
Me too!
Go!
Where I am going to go now?
Bad Beak Seung Jo!
He's not even worried!
How could he not even call? &lt;i&gt;Brought to you by the PKer team @ www.viikii.net
Come to our club! We will escort you.
I ...
It's really great.
Where are you going in the middle of the night?
Since you're not looking for her, the least I can do is to go out and look for her myself.
I'm worried too, but since it's happened, you should leave her to solve this herself.
For Ha Ni's sake, it's a good thing
I understand.
But you... do you know...?
A person's feelings don't have one answer like a math problem.
What the right answer is...I don't know either. &lt;i&gt;Seung Jo's words are right...
I've never thought about myself or done anything for my future. &lt;i&gt; I still can't go back. &lt;i&gt; This didn't change me at all. &lt;i&gt; Just wait, before we get married, I'll become a woman worthy of you Baek Seung Jo.
Thanks for coming!
Please come again!
Workers needed!
Did you finish?
Yes.
But will a young lady like you be able to do it? Though it looks like this, it's going to be pretty hard.
If it's hard, the harder it is the better. If there are a lot of orders you might even have to cook
Now, don't worry about that.
My dad is a chef, and his noodle restaurant has a 60 year old history.
Is that so?
So, can you start today?
Actually, one of the ladies quit so we do need help.
Yes. Of course.
I'll do my best.
It's okay.
Let me do this.
Okay.
You do it.
Aunty, I'll do the dishes too
Just leave them.
Working part-time in a restaurant?
I thought she went back home, but she is working in that restaurant.
Oh Ha Ni is out looking for trouble again.
She said that this should be kept a secret from Seung Jo.
So she doesn't want to see Baek Seung Jo until she makes something great out of herself?
No, apparently the restaurant is a bit grungy The dirty aprons don't make her feel right
What is this?
Ah.
But how is she going to go to school?
She did say something about dropping out.
Is she going to continue working there?
Oh my.
Baek Seung Jo
I'll be going now!
I'm back!
Welcome!
What should we have?
Our bean-paste soup is really good.
Then should we have that?
Two bean-paste soups please.
Ah, yes.
Aunty, two bean-paste soups please.
Please enjoy your meals!
Oh Ha Ni?
Aren't you Oh Ha Ni?
No, I'm not.
You are.
You are Ha Ni.
What are you doing here, Ha Ni?
Are you working?
Something like that.
I heard you got into the law program.
You must be studying for the licensing exam, right?
I heard it was really hard.
If you're not someone like the genius Baek Seung Jo, then it'll be difficult to pass with one try.
There are even people who've been taking the test for 12 years.
You guys are lucky that everything comes so easy to you guys.
A lot of people say it like that.
But doesn't matter how smart you are, it's hard following the masses.
I'm not sure, but Seung Jo is probably trying really hard on his own too.
Nothing comes free in life, kiddo.
Since you have such a hard time studying, you're trying to find something else to do?!
What would it be?
By any chance... housewife?
That's perfect Ha Ni. You and the tray look perfect together.
Work hard.
I'm rooting for you.
Unnie is going to go.
I've got to study.
Please continue.
Aunty, I'm back.
Oh good job.
Customer at table 9 ordered bean paste soup.
I'll go out for a sec.
Please enjoy your meal! It's tasteless.
Is that so?
I'll make it again.
Even if you make it again, it will probably taste the same.
Seung Jo.
Your friends said that the food here is delicious?
What's wrong with the taste?
Okay. What are you going to do in the future?
Being apart from you for a couple days...
I realized how tiring I am towards you and how childish I was.
I think I thought too much of my comfort. So, you've made a decision after thinking it over?
What is the thing I want to do the most?
I thought about it.
What is that?
Seung Jo, you may think it's ridiculous and laugh in my face.
No matter how much I think about it, this is the only thing I want.
Helping with Baek Seung Jo's work.
I'm going to become a nurse. Since it has to do with life (the living), you might think it's too much for me.
Even so, I'm seriously thinking about it.
I want to become a wife who would suit you.
So you've thought a lot about it.
Trying your best to become a nurse.
Seung Jo.
Stop it and come back home now.
Is it fine if I do?
The truth is, I missed you so much I thought I would die.
I know, I know it all.
You must really be busy with school Seung Jo.
Its going to be hard seeing you around.
It seems that I will be out of it until graduation.
I . . .
That's right!
The game Seung Jo developed, it's going to an American game show next year!
Wow!
That's great.
I have something to say everyone.
Please empty your schedule for this coming Wednesday
Wednesday?
I have a golf appointment with Chairman Yoon that day.
The restaurant workers and I are going out
I can't either.
I'm invited to a birthday party.
Me too.
Okay.
You all cancel.
What's this?
What is happening on that day?
Your wedding!
Wedding?! &lt;i&gt;Brought to you by the PKer team @ www.viikii.net
Let's see if we can write 59.2 percent (59.2 %) as a decimal.
Well 59.2 percent - this literally means 59.2 per cent - which literally means 59.2 per 100 - which literally means 59.2 per 100 - which is the same thing as 59.2 √∑ 100.
If we were to divide 59.2 by 100, what would we get?
So this is the same thing is 59.2 √∑ 100.
So if we if we were to take 59.2 - if we wanted to divide it by 10, we would move the decimal over to the left once.
We would get 5.92.
But we want to divide by 100.
So we move the decimal over to the left again.
We're dividing by 10 once, and then we're dividing by 10 again.
If you divide by 10 twice, you're essentially dividing by 100.
So you move the decimal to the left twice, and you get 0. 592.
And we'll just put a 0 out here just to clarify things.
And we're done.
We've written 59.2% as a decimal.
We essentially just divided this by a hundred, which is dividing by 10 twice, moving the decimal once to the left, and then moving it another time.
Or, since we're dividing by 100, moving the decimal twice to the left.
And we get 0.592.
Introducing Photo Filters
Ahh, San Francisco: land of a million vacation photos.
And here's Phil!
Phil has filled his phone with photos and is using Twitter's photo editor to tweet them out.
Let's learn how.
While composing a Tweet, Phil taps on the Camera icon and then navigates to the photo he would like to use.
That's the one!
And now he's ready to edit!
As you can see there are three icons at the bottom.
The first one automatically-enhances your image for a quick fix.
The icon on the right allows you to crop the image, move and scale your photo and select either original or square.
Finally, clicking the center option allows you to choose a filter for your photo.
Tap one of the filters to see it up close or swipe the image to try another.
There we go!
Phil's finished so he clicks "Done".
And he's ready to send his Tweet and share the photo.
All of his fabulous filtered photos show up on his home timeline
Wonderful memories from the city by the Bay.

Hi. I'm Ed Freeman.
I'm a professor at the University &lt;br/&gt;of Virginia's Darden School of Business.
I've been lucky enough to spend the last &lt;br/&gt;30 years or so working with executives and entrepreneurs all over the world,&lt;br/&gt;trying to help them understand how business creates value in society.
The purpose of this course &lt;br/&gt;is to share those ideas with you.
There are no prerequisites.
There are no assigned readings.
I would like you to have a big curiosity &lt;br/&gt;about how business works in society.
There's a revolution in business.
There are new models of understanding &lt;br/&gt;how business works.
It's not just about money and profits.
Business is a key part of making &lt;br/&gt;our lives better in the 21st century and this course will bring you &lt;br/&gt;up to date on the models and theories about how that works.
You'll learn about creating value &lt;br/&gt;for stakeholders, customers, suppliers, employers, communities, &lt;br/&gt;and people with the money.
You'll learn about conscious capitalism &lt;br/&gt;and the role of purpose in business.
You'll learn about social &lt;br/&gt;or stakeholder entrepreneurship, shared and sustainable value models, corporate social responsibility, &lt;br/&gt;and philanthropy.
And at the end of the course, &lt;br/&gt;I'll show you how and then I'll ask you to create a new business idea &lt;br/&gt;that's based on these models that makes people's lives better, &lt;br/&gt;makes society better and makes money.
So, if you're interested in business, if you're interested &lt;br/&gt;in making business better, sign up for this course.
Tell your friends to sign up. I'm looking forward &lt;br/&gt;to getting to know you.
Thanks.

Okay, now I don't want to alarm anybody in this room, but it's just come to my attention that the person to your right is a liar.
(Laughter)
Also, the person to your left is a liar.
Also the person sitting in your very seats is a liar.
We're all liars.
What I'm going to do today is I'm going to show you what the research says about why we're all liars, how you can become a liespotter and why you might want to go the extra mile and go from liespotting to truth seeking, and ultimately to trust building.
Now, speaking of trust, ever since I wrote this book, "Liespotting," no one wants to meet me in person anymore, no, no, no, no, no.
They say, "It's okay, we'll email you."
(Laughter)
I can't even get a coffee date at Starbucks.
My husband's like, "Honey, deception?
Maybe you could have focused on cooking. How about French cooking?"
So before I get started, what I'm going to do is I'm going to clarify my goal for you, which is not to teach a game of Gotcha.
Liespotters aren't those nitpicky kids, those kids in the back of the room that are shouting, "Gotcha!
Gotcha! Your eyebrow twitched.
You flared your nostril.
I watch that TV show 'Lie To Me.'
I know you're lying."
No, liespotters are armed with scientific knowledge of how to spot deception.
They use it to get to the truth, and they do what mature leaders do everyday; they have difficult conversations with difficult people, sometimes during very difficult times.
And they start up that path by accepting a core proposition, and that proposition is the following:
Lying is a cooperative act.
Think about it, a lie has no power whatsoever by its mere utterance.
Its power emerges when someone else agrees to believe the lie.
So I know it may sound like tough love, but look, if at some point you got lied to, it's because you agreed to get lied to.
Truth number one about lying:
Lying's a cooperative act.
Now not all lies are harmful.
Sometimes we're willing participants in deception for the sake of social dignity, maybe to keep a secret that should be kept secret, secret.
We say, "Nice song."
"Honey, you don't look fat in that, no."
Or we say, favorite of the digiratti,
"You know, I just fished that email out of my Spam folder.
So sorry."
But there are times when we are unwilling participants in deception.
And that can have dramatic costs for us.
Last year saw 997 billion dollars in corporate fraud alone in the United States.
That's an eyelash under a trillion dollars.
That's seven percent of revenues.
Deception can cost billions.
Think Enron, Madoff, the mortgage crisis.
Or in the case of double agents and traitors, like Robert Hanssen or Aldrich Ames, lies can betray our country, they can compromise our security, they can undermine democracy, they can cause the deaths of those that defend us.
Deception is actually serious business.
This con man, Henry Oberlander, he was such an effective con man,
British authorities say he could have undermined the entire banking system of the Western world.
And you can't find this guy on Google; you can't find him anywhere.
He was interviewed once, and he said the following.
He said, "Look, I've got one rule." And this was Henry's rule, he said,
"Look, everyone is willing to give you something.
They're ready to give you something for whatever it is they're hungry for."
And that's the crux of it.
If you don't want to be deceived, you have to know, what is it that you're hungry for?
And we all kind of hate to admit it.
We wish we were better husbands, better wives, smarter, more powerful, taller, richer -- the list goes on.
Lying is an attempt to bridge that gap, to connect our wishes and our fantasies about who we wish we were, how we wish we could be, with what we're really like.
And boy are we willing to fill in those gaps in our lives with lies.
On a given day, studies show that you may be lied to anywhere from 10 to 200 times.
Now granted, many of those are white lies.
But in another study, it showed that strangers lied three times within the first 10 minutes of meeting each other.
(Laughter)
Now when we first hear this data, we recoil.
We can't believe how prevalent lying is.
We're essentially against lying.
But if you look more closely, the plot actually thickens.
We lie more to strangers than we lie to coworkers.
Extroverts lie more than introverts.
Men lie eight times more about themselves than they do other people.
Women lie more to protect other people.
If you're an average married couple, you're going to lie to your spouse in one out of every 10 interactions.
Now, you may think that's bad.
If you're unmarried, that number drops to three.
Lying's complex.
It's woven into the fabric of our daily and our business lives.
We're deeply ambivalent about the truth.
We parse it out on an as-needed basis, sometimes for very good reasons, other times just because we don't understand the gaps in our lives.
That's truth number two about lying.
We're against lying, but we're covertly for it in ways that our society has sanctioned for centuries and centuries and centuries.
It's as old as breathing.
It's part of our culture, it's part of our history.
Think Dante, Shakespeare, the Bible, News of the World.
(Laughter)
Lying has evolutionary value to us as a species.
Researchers have long known that the more intelligent the species, the larger the neocortex, the more likely it is to be deceptive.
Now you might remember Koko.
Does anybody remember Koko the gorilla who was taught sign language?
Koko was taught to communicate via sign language.
Here's Koko with her kitten.
It's her cute little, fluffy pet kitten.
Koko once blamed her pet kitten for ripping a sink out of the wall.
(Laughter)
We're hardwired to become leaders of the pack.
It's starts really, really early.
How early?
Well babies will fake a cry, pause, wait to see who's coming and then go right back to crying.
One-year-olds learn concealment.
(Laughter)
Two-year-olds bluff.
Five-year-olds lie outright.
They manipulate via flattery.
Nine-year-olds, masters of the cover-up.
By the time you enter college, you're going to lie to your mom in one out of every five interactions.
By the time we enter this work world and we're breadwinners, we enter a world that is just cluttered with Spam, fake digital friends, partisan media, ingenious identity thieves, world-class Ponzi schemers, a deception epidemic -- in short, what one author calls a post-truth society.
It's been very confusing for a long time now.
What do you do?
Well, there are steps we can take to navigate our way through the morass.
Trained liespotters get to the truth 90 percent of the time.
The rest of us, we're only 54 percent accurate.
Why is it so easy to learn?
There are good liars and bad liars.
There are no real original liars.
We all make the same mistakes.
We all use the same techniques. So what I'm going to do is I'm going to show you two patterns of deception.
And then we're going to look at the hot spots and see if we can find them ourselves.
We're going to start with speech.
(Video) Bill Clinton:
I want you to listen to me. I'm going to say this again.
I did not have sexual relations with that woman, Miss Lewinsky.
I never told anybody to lie, not a single time, never.
And these allegations are false.
And I need to go back to work for the American people.
Thank you.
Pamela Meyer:
Okay, what were the telltale signs?
Well first we heard what's known as a non-contracted denial.
Studies show that people who are overdetermined in their denial will resort to formal rather than informal language.
We also heard distancing language: "that woman."
We know that liars will unconsciously distance themselves from their subject, using language as their tool.
Now if Bill Clinton had said, "Well, to tell you the truth ..." or Richard Nixon's favorite, "In all candor ..." he would have been a dead giveaway for any liespotter that knows that qualifying language, as it's called, qualifying language like that, further discredits the subject.
Now if he had repeated the question in its entirety, or if he had peppered his account with a little too much detail -- and we're all really glad he didn't do that -- he would have further discredited himself.
Freud had it right.
Freud said, look, there's much more to it than speech:
"No mortal can keep a secret.
If his lips are silent, he chatters with his fingertips."
And we all do it no matter how powerful you are.
We all chatter with our fingertips.
I'm going to show you Dominique Strauss-Kahn with Obama who's chattering with his fingertips.
(Laughter)
Now this brings us to our next pattern, which is body language.
With body language, here's what you've got to do.
You've really got to just throw your assumptions out the door.
Let the science temper your knowledge a little bit.
Because we think liars fidget all the time.
Well guess what, they're known to freeze their upper bodies when they're lying.
We think liars won't look you in the eyes.
Well guess what, they look you in the eyes a little too much just to compensate for that myth.
We think warmth and smiles convey honesty, sincerity.
But a trained liespotter can spot a fake smile a mile away.
Can you all spot the fake smile here?
You can consciously contract the muscles in your cheeks.
But the real smile's in the eyes, the crow's feet of the eyes.
They cannot be consciously contracted, especially if you overdid the Botox.
Don't overdo the Botox; nobody will think you're honest.
Now we're going to look at the hot spots.
Can you tell what's happening in a conversation?
Can you start to find the hot spots to see the discrepancies between someone's words and someone's actions?
Now, I know it seems really obvious, but when you're having a conversation with someone you suspect of deception, attitude is by far the most overlooked but telling of indicators.
An honest person is going to be cooperative.
They're going to show they're on your side.
They're going to be enthusiastic.
They're going to be willing and helpful to getting you to the truth.
They're going to be willing to brainstorm, name suspects, provide details.
They're going to say, "Hey, maybe it was those guys in payroll that forged those checks."
They're going to be infuriated if they sense they're wrongly accused throughout the entire course of the interview, not just in flashes; they'll be infuriated throughout the entire course of the interview.
And if you ask someone honest what should happen to whomever did forge those checks, an honest person is much more likely to recommend strict rather than lenient punishment.
Now let's say you're having that exact same conversation with someone deceptive.
That person may be withdrawn, look down, lower their voice, pause, be kind of herky-jerky.
Ask a deceptive person to tell their story, they're going to pepper it with way too much detail in all kinds of irrelevant places.
And then they're going to tell their story in strict chronological order.
And what a trained interrogator does is they come in and in very subtle ways over the course of several hours, they will ask that person to tell that story backwards, and then they'll watch them squirm, and track which questions produce the highest volume of deceptive tells.
Why do they do that?
Well, we all do the same thing.
We rehearse our words, but we rarely rehearse our gestures.
We say "yes," we shake our heads "no."
We tell very convincing stories, we slightly shrug our shoulders.
We commit terrible crimes, and we smile at the delight in getting away with it.
Now, that smile is known in the trade as "duping delight."
And we're going to see that in several videos moving forward, but we're going to start -- for those of you who don't know him, this is presidential candidate John Edwards who shocked America by fathering a child out of wedlock.
We're going to see him talk about getting a paternity test.
See now if you can spot him saying, "yes" while shaking his head "no," slightly shrugging his shoulders.
(Video) John Edwards:
I'd be happy to participate in one.
I know that it's not possible that this child could be mine, because of the timing of events.
So I know it's not possible.
Happy to take a paternity test, and would love to see it happen.
Interviewer:
Are you going to do that soon?
Is there somebody --
JE:
Well, I'm only one side.
I'm only one side of the test.
But I'm happy to participate in one.
PM: Okay, those head shakes are much easier to spot once you know to look for them.
There are going to be times when someone makes one expression while masking another that just kind of leaks through in a flash.
Murderers are known to leak sadness.
Your new joint venture partner might shake your hand, celebrate, go out to dinner with you and then leak an expression of anger.
And we're not all going to become facial expression experts overnight here, but there's one I can teach you that's very dangerous and it's easy to learn, and that's the expression of contempt.
Now with anger, you've got two people on an even playing field.
It's still somewhat of a healthy relationship.
But when anger turns to contempt, you've been dismissed.
It's associated with moral superiority.
And for that reason, it's very, very hard to recover from.
Here's what it looks like.
It's marked by one lip corner pulled up and in.
It's the only asymmetrical expression.
And in the presence of contempt, whether or not deception follows -- and it doesn't always follow -- look the other way, go the other direction, reconsider the deal, say, "No thank you. I'm not coming up for just one more nightcap.
Thank you."
Science has surfaced many, many more indicators.
We know, for example, we know liars will shift their blink rate, point their feet towards an exit.
They will take barrier objects and put them between themselves and the person that is interviewing them.
They'll alter their vocal tone, often making their vocal tone much lower.
Now here's the deal.
These behaviors are just behaviors.
They're not proof of deception.
They're red flags.
We're human beings.
We make deceptive flailing gestures all over the place all day long.
They don't mean anything in and of themselves.
But when you see clusters of them, that's your signal.
Look, listen, probe, ask some hard questions, get out of that very comfortable mode of knowing, walk into curiosity mode, ask more questions, have a little dignity, treat the person you're talking to with rapport.
Don't try to be like those folks on "Law &amp; Order" and those other TV shows that pummel their subjects into submission.
Don't be too aggressive, it doesn't work.
Now, we've talked a little bit about how to talk to someone who's lying and how to spot a lie.
And as I promised, we're now going to look at what the truth looks like.
But I'm going to show you two videos, two mothers -- one is lying, one is telling the truth.
And these were surfaced by researcher David Matsumoto in California.
And I think they're an excellent example of what the truth looks like.
This mother, Diane Downs, shot her kids at close range, drove them to the hospital while they bled all over the car, claimed a scraggy-haired stranger did it.
And you'll see when you see the video, she can't even pretend to be an agonizing mother.
What you want to look for here is an incredible discrepancy between horrific events that she describes and her very, very cool demeanor.
And if you look closely, you'll see duping delight throughout this video.
I can see Christie reaching her hand out to me while I'm driving, and the blood just kept coming out of her mouth.
And that -- maybe it'll fade too with time -- but I don't think so.
That bothers me the most.
PM: Now I'm going to show you a video of an actual grieving mother, Erin Runnion, confronting her daughter's murderer and torturer in court.
Here you're going to see no false emotion, just the authentic expression of a mother's agony.
(Video) Erin Runnion: I wrote this statement on the third anniversary of the night you took my baby, and you hurt her, and you crushed her, you terrified her until her heart stopped.
And she fought, and I know she fought you.
But I know she looked at you with those amazing brown eyes, and you still wanted to kill her.
And I don't understand it, and I never will. PM:
Okay, there's no doubting the veracity of those emotions.
Now the technology around what the truth looks like is progressing on, the science of it.
We know, for example, that we now have specialized eye trackers and infrared brain scans, MRl's that can decode the signals that our bodies send out when we're trying to be deceptive.
And these technologies are going to be marketed to all of us as panaceas for deceit, and they will prove incredibly useful some day.
But you've got to ask yourself in the meantime:
Who do you want on your side of the meeting, someone who's trained in getting to the truth or some guy who's going to drag a 400-pound electroencephalogram through the door?
Liespotters rely on human tools.
They know, as someone once said,
"Character's who you are in the dark."
And what's kind of interesting is that today, we have so little darkness.
Our world is lit up 24 hours a day.
It's transparent with blogs and social networks broadcasting the buzz of a whole new generation of people that have made a choice to live their lives in public.
It's a much more noisy world.
So one challenge we have is to remember, oversharing, that's not honesty.
Our manic tweeting and texting can blind us to the fact that the subtleties of human decency -- character integrity -- that's still what matters, that's always what's going to matter.
So in this much noisier world, it might make sense for us to be just a little bit more explicit about our moral code.
When you combine the science of recognizing deception with the art of looking, listening, you exempt yourself from collaborating in a lie.
You start up that path of being just a little bit more explicit, because you signal to everyone around you, you say, "Hey, my world, our world, it's going to be an honest one.
My world is going to be one where truth is strengthened and falsehood is recognized and marginalized."
And when you do that, the ground around you starts to shift just a little bit.
And that's the truth.
Thank you.
(Applause)

Episode 15
Everybody listen here!
Yes ?
I also have something to say.
Everyone please free your schedule on next Wednesday.
But...
I'm going to play golf with Mr. Yoon on that day.
Ah, me too. I have to go somewhere with the shop workers on that day.
I can't either.
I got invited to a birthday party.
Me too.
Ah okay.
Cancel it all.
Why?
Why?
What's happening that day?
Your wedding.
W-w-wedding?!
Ah, please stop controlling us any which way you please.
Omo!
Who's deciding? You said you want to get married. I said after graduation!
When will that be?
You have to become an intern, then a resident and you have to do your military service, too.
What's the point of delaying? It's better to do it now, when you're still pretty and youthful.
But.... - The birthday party ....
- Stop! don't say anything else right now!
Do you have any idea how hard it is for me to reserve a wedding hall?
On that day, clear out all your schedules and you need to help each other out, alright?
You're still awake?
Ah... Yes.. .Yes.
What is it?
Did I go overboard by doing what I please?
That... that's not it.
We're living together anyway.
I thought they might as well be married, and it would look better in the eyes of others too.
Oh I see.
Honestly that was bothering me a bit too.
Thank you for everything.
But... Why are you like this?
Your expression doesn't look good.
No, I'm doing good.
It's just that I don't know what to start preparing first.
What is there to prepare?We already live together so there is nothing to buy, and the wedding hall has been booked.
We just need a dress and a ring, then everything will be fine.
Still...
Next Wednesday?!!!
Yeah.
Seung Jo's mother has some serious drive.
That's right.
Hey, did you guys cause some sort of accident?
Ya!
It's not that!
Ah yes.
Does Bong Joon Gu knows?
Um... My dad has told him.
So that's why he looked so down in the dumps.
He didn't even notice us when we came.
Hey, did you pick your dress?
You have to buy your ring too.
We have to start now.
I'm busy.
Welc....
Sir!
Hey hurry and talk to me.
Hey, let's eat!
Eat well!
Sir, sir!
A foreigner came!
She is right over there, a foreigner!
Oh.
Quickly, quickly, quickly!
Hurry!
Hi.
Hi.
Thank you.
Ha Ni, hurry up and take her order.
Me?
I can't speak English.
But, you're a college student.
Hurry up!
Hi.
Hi.
How are you?
I . . . want to eat noodles!
Please give me chopped noodles.
She speaks korean very well.
What is it?
It's mushroom.
Pine mushrooms.
Ah, pine mushrooms.
The scent . . . The scent is very nice!
She said pine mushrooms.
Her accent is so cute!
It's good for your health too.
This is called oyster.
Ah yes, oyster.
I usually don't eat this.
This tastes good.
How do you speak Korean so well?
My mom is Korean, but my dad is English.
I came to Korea to see my mother's hometown.
I have to go home in 10 days.
Ah... yeah.
It's delicious.
Very, very delicious.
That's stuffed cucumber kimchi.
That guy over there made it!
This tastes good!
It's killer!
He is from Busan, so he's a little curt.
Ah... Yes...
How was the one we saw before?
It's too showy.
Really ?
Then what about this one?
This one is pretty.
I don't like it.
It's too shiny.
Then, you choose it.
Hey! Do we have to get rings?
What are you talking about?
It's a symbol of love.
A symbol of love?
Hey!
How can something so materialistic be a symbol of love?
I'm not doing this!
No!
You have to do it!
There needs to be a sign that you're a married man.
So it's not really a symbol of love but more like shackles.
Forget it!
What's there to buy when you only wear it that one day?
I have a suit already.
Still!
Let's go in!
I'm going to look for a dress.
Then go buy it and come back.
I'll go somewhere and wait for you.
OK!
Then, let's go to the studio.
Studio?
Why?
Why?
It's for the photo album shoot.
Photo album shoot?
Hey!
I'm not doing that.
Husband look over here, bride smile a bit more...
You want me to do that silly thing?
Never.
This isn't fair.
You don't want to match rings.
You don't want to do the album photo shoot as well.
Why did you come out with me if you were going to be like this?
Do you think I came because I wanted to?
I came out just because they wanted me to.
Anyways, you came out.
Can't you just put up with it and help?
You've only been irritated and saying you don't like this and that!
Hey.
Why are you speaking like this in the street?
It's embarrassing.
Embarrassing?
I'm embarrassed too!
What do you think the people at the rings store thought about us?
Why should I have to continually match your wants and needs?
Don't then.
If I don't... .What if I don't hold it in either?!
Now I see why couples break up before even getting married.
What?
I'm telling you now.
Even after marrying you, I won't be able to just look to you.
I can't adjust myself for you.
When did you ever?
Really...
What's all this?
It's because of my mom.
It's not because of Mother (in-law).
If so, why did you say you were going to marry me?
Yeah. I'm regretting why I said that.
I think we should think about it again.
Really?
So you weren't able to get your dress yet?
He doesn't even talk to me at home.
When we run into one another he avoids me.
What?
There's not many days left...
He said he regrets asking me to marry him, and that we should think it over.
No, you know how Baek Seung Jo is normally cold like that.
Even if he says that, he doesn't mean it.
The business hours are over.
Oh, Seung Jo!
Come on in!
Have a seat.
You were reading a book?
From a dad to his daughter...
I wanted to talk to her about it.
What brought you here at this time?
I have something to tell you.
Doesn't it look beautiful?
It would be nice drinking coffee with those cups.
Yes, it looks beautiful.
Why does a bride-to-be's face look so upset?
Is Seung Jo being a pain?
No.
Wow, how beautiful.
Hey Dad.
Ha Ni, what are you doing?
Oh, is that so?
Then come here for a moment.
Now?
Why, did something happen?
Date?
I understand.
I'm coming now.
Dad..
Oh! Ha Ni.
Where are we going?
Where are we going, exactly?
You will find out once we get there. &lt;i&gt;Brought to you by the PKer team @ www.viikii.net
Seung Jo wanted to greet your grandmother and mother.
I was busy so I forgot about it.
Nice to meet you, Mother.
Grandmother...
Your grandson-in-law is here.
Do you like it?
I'm worried because Oh Ha Ni isn't listening to me already, but you don't have to worry.
I will take care of her.
I hate you.
Hate ?
I like it.
Thank you.
Mom..
Grandmom..
I'm getting married.
Kyung Soo sunbae is going to be the host.
Officiator.
Let's not have an officiator.
What about our honeymoon?
Where are we going for our honeymoon?
Do we have to go?
We don't have much time.
There you go again!
Fine, fine.
Where?
Is there a place you would like to go?
Yes!
Italy?
Perhaps Rome!
Rome?
Rome?
In your dreams.
I was just joking.
Even if it's not far away, I hope we go to an island.
Island.
Okay then Alright then.
How about Yeo Eui Do?
Yeo Eui Do?
Why?
Yeo Eui Do was once an island as well
Or...Bam Island?
Right!...Ddook I sland!
Ddook Island?!
How annoying.
Fine.
Let's determine with this.
If 3 of the same pictures appear after a shake... we'll go to the place you wish.
Okay.
But isn't there only a small possibility?
No.
Jeju island, jeju island, jeju island.
Yeo Eui Do...
Jeju Island!
Jeju Island!
It's Jeju Island.
Wow!!
Hooray!
Yes! Jeju Island!
Yay!
Hurray!
How does it feel?
It's tomorrow.
I don't know.
It still hasn't hit me yet.
Have you packed your bag?
Yeah, just the basics.
Surprise!
What ,is it?
Open it.
Oh my.
Just rip it open, like this.
Okay.
Hey!!
What do you mean "Hey"?
We searched on the Internet.
They said that the most important thing on the honeymoon is underwear and nightwear.
And fragrance.
See. You take a shower first.
Seung Jo oppa!
Then you wear this underwear all sexy, like this.
And you spray some of the fragrance.
Put on make up lightly as well.
When you take a shower, there is an important point.
What is it?
Never, ever, hum to yourself.
Why is that?
Men get scared when you are too powerful.
I see.
Hey, does Baek Seung Jo kiss well?
Hey!
- Tell me. - Does he kiss well?
Hey!
Was he good?!
Was he good?!
How did he do it?!
Stop!
Here...
What is that?
It's just silverware and a china set.
Hey!
Why did you buy this?
I hear even if you do nothing, this is something you have to do.
I also bought a set of blankets.
It's in the room, but I don't know if you'll like it.
Oh my!
In law, please look to us kindly!
Yes.
Please look to me kindly too, in law!
What to do.
Hyung.
Are you asleep?
No.
So you're eventually getting married to Oh Ha Ni.
It seems so.
Why, you don't like it?
Of course.
Oh Ha Ni isn't smart and she's clumsy.
More than anything, she's stupid.
Doesn't even know how to swim but tried to save me.
Even though you're mean to her, she smiles about liking you.
I'm going to marry a girl much smarter and prettier than Oh Ha Ni.
Okay.
But, I'm all for Hyung and Oh Ha Ni getting married.
I like you very much, but to be honest, it is quite true that your personality has a few issues.
And so, I think that you should marry a person like Oh Ha Ni.
You're doing the right thing. Congrats.
Ha Ni,
I'm really happy right now, because you're probably really happy right now.
When you're happy,
I'm happy as well.
Congratulations, Oh Ha Ni.
Have beautiful dreams and I'll see you tomorrow.
What?
They're the ones that wanted to stay up all night and talk. &lt;i&gt;Brought to you by the PKer team @ www.viikii.net

I can't sleep.
How about you?
Me too.
Dad.
Yes?
Thank you for raising me this well.
Oh
Don't cry.
If your eyes get swollen, other people tomorrow will say that the bride's not pretty.
Oh ?
I said not to cry.
Why do you cry when it's such a happy day?
I will smile too.
You too, have to smile tomorrow, ok?
The only daughter of a widowed father.
If she cries on her wedding day her life will be rainy.
Okay.
I will smile.
Yeah.

Hi!
Congratulations, Ha Ni!
Congratulations.
You are pregnant?
What happened to you!??
It's embarrassing!
Ha Ni, congratulations!
Marrying with Seung Jo, you're epic!!
You've succeeded!
You've done it!
Ha Ni, see you later.
Thank you for coming.
You look pretty!
Ha Ni, congratulations!
You look really beautiful!
Teachers getting married is pretty epic too.
Did you see that?
You will one day get pregnant, too Won't you?
You look pretty.
You too.
I feel good that it's you.
Hmm?
I feel good that Baek Seung Jo chose you, not me.
Yeah.
This is why I like him.
I'm thinking like that.
It's hard.
What's hard?
Baek Seung Jo has good taste in girls.
That's what I mean.
Hae Ra.
Be happy, so I become jealous and marry quickly.
Okay, I'll try hard.
Don't try hard.
I feel scared when you say that you're going to try hard.
Oh Ha Ni's patience and perseverance...
To top that off if Oh Ha Ni tries hard too...
Everyone's dead...
All right.
Congratulations.
Thank you.
See you later.
You came?
Ya, you look happy.
You're smiling very wide.
Your mouth looks like it's going to rip.
You look good.
Of course.
Be careful, Ha Ni might change her mind after seeing me.
I could run away with her.
Ladies and gentlemen.
Soon, bridegroom Baek Seung Jo and the bride Oh Ha Ni's wedding will start.
What do I do, Eun Jo?
It's going to start.
Are you nervous?
Don't make mistakes again, whether you drop the ring or you step on your own dress and slip.
Hey.
Don't say things like that.
Do you want me to give you a wedding present?
Gift?
Yeah.
What is it?
Give me your ears.
What?!
Ah, as you see, there's no officiator in this wedding, so we'll have the two of them doing their own officiating.
Start.
I, Baek Seung Jo, will respect and love my bride, Oh Ha Ni, whatever it takes, will respect the elders, will be a good husband to her,
I promise.
I, Oh Ha Ni, with groom Baek Seung Jo, will love and respect forever whatever it takes.
I promise I will respect the elders, and be a good wife to him.
This bride's dad is a very old friend of mine.
Until junior high, it was as if I lived at his house.
He's done a lot for me.
It was like that back then, and it was like that once we met again too.
I always thought that there couldn't be a warmer and nicer person than him.
This amazing friend of mine has now become my in law.
My friend, thank you for letting your well raised daughter marry my son.
After thinking about what I should say,
I remembered my short married life.
On our wedding day, it snowed a lot.
And on Christmas eve, while we were eating the leftover noodles, we said "Merry Christmas" to each other.
After that, Ha Ni came and my wife passed.
I was holding Ha Ni and crying.
I remembered all that.
It doesn't seem like such a big deal, but I was very happy.
It was probably because of the hardships we endured together.
Like how my mother-in-law would call her Noah's snail all the time.
She knew what road to take, and she is a child who took that road smiling.
I was always sad and sorry about her being alone.
From today, since a caring and cool groom is going with her, my heart is put at ease and I'm reassured.
Thank you, Seung Jo.
Go with Ha Ni to the end.
It is time for the ring exchange.
Groom and bride, please exchange rings.
What to do?
Here it is!
Thank you.
Dummy.
Don't tease me, Baek Seung Jo, when you actually like me a lot, starting from a long time ago too.
What?
What are you talking about?
The second kiss. Instead of in the rain, it was at the pension wasn't it?
I was sleeping, how childish.
After doing that, being so coy.
What is this?
Everyone, the bride is really bold!
Look at you now.
Everyone let's give the bride and groom a round of applause!
Wow!
It's so cool!
Can we get out and see the ocean for a little while and then go?
Let's see it and go, huh? Let's see the ocean and go!
It's so pretty!
Look at the color of the ocean.
It's really pretty, isn't it?
I feel like I've come to the South Pacific.
How can the ocean be that blue?
What?
Are you still mad?
If you're done looking, let's go.
The growing of our two lovebirds, the bride and groom, has been prepared through a video.
Please continue eating the food in front of you, and let's appreciate this together.
Since she was a baby, her beauty was different from others
This child, grew up to be a man over there.
Is that hyung?!
Right.
That's hyung.
I feel so much better. From now on, I don't think I can live holding a secret.
Seung Jo, you live lightly too from now on.
Carefree!
Mother-in-law, really. She went overboard.
Even though she was well aware of your temper.
Hey!
Where are you going?!
Hey!
Stop there!
Hey, Baek Seung Jo!!
How long are you going to keep on following me?
Ah, about that...
Hae Ra!
Are you not hungry?
I noticed earlier that you hadn't eaten anything.
Do you want me to buy you food? &lt;i&gt; Brought to you by the PKer team @ www.viikii.net&lt;/i&gt;
It's different from the hotel that I thought of.
It's really pretty.
We're over there.
Oh, how frustrating!
What kind of man has so little strength?
I'm sorry.
Oh, what's up with this?
Are you staying here?
Do you not remember?
We sat next to each other on the plane.
Ah, yes.
Ah, check-in. Check-in!
Oh okay.
Couldn't even find the hotel gate. Making me come in through the back.
Ah, I'm really going to go crazy.
I didn't notice while I was sitting next to you earlier, but you're really handsome.
You could be an actor!
Ah, then we'll be leaving first.
Let's go.
Oh, excuse me!
You must really like hot dogs.
Do you not like hot dogs that much?
Should we go eat something else?
No, it's okay.
Please eat.
Do you want me to tell you something fun?
Eye booger.
What?
What is this?
What is this? Hot Dog Eating Competition.
If you can eat 30 in ten minutes, you qualify for the competition in New York.
They can go to New York.
Between the ages of 20 and 40.
I can do it, I'm 21. Right, right?
Hey this...
Hae Ra, Hae Ra!
If it's 30 hotdogs in 10 minutes, then it's 1 hotdog per 20 seconds.
It can't be done?
I think it's possible.
You're going to do it?
I should go for things like that.
I get to eat a lot of hot dogs, I get to go to New York, and I win, the prize which will probably be really big.
If I win and get a prize, I'll buy you yummy stuff.
Let's practice.
I'll eat this.
Count from 1 to 20 okay.
1... 2...
You laughed.
Did you not get sick that day?
You practiced tennis real hard for a long time.
I don't get sick over something like that.
What do you mean something like that? You practiced for four hours.
You were there for four hours, sunbae?
Let's eat... hotdog. &lt;i&gt;Brought to you by the PKer team @ www.viikii.net.
It's so nice here.
And the ocean is right in front of our noses.
It is really beautiful!
Excuse me...
I'll try hard.
I know I'm not that great with a lot of things, but I'll try!
I'll be a good wife. &lt;i&gt;Oh, what do I do! &lt;i&gt;The environment seems so good.
Oh!
Ah, you're in that room.
Our room is over there.
It is really fate!
What is this candle light event?
It's our hotel's most popular program for newlyweds on their honeymoon.
You should be pretty pleased with just the meal alone.
The feedback is really good.
Grilled pork, eel, and lobster marinade.
Caesar salad as well as live music and picture service.
Should we try this?
On a weekday like today we have a wonderful wine service that's on the house.
Really?
A candle light dinner and free wine too?!
It is good.
What do you think?
Alright, we'll take this for our dinner tonight.
Yes, I got it.
We'll contact your room as soon as it's ready.
All you have to do is come to the restaurant next to the pond.
Yes.
There's only 1 other couple that requested this aside from you.
Seeing there's only 2 couples it should be quite cozy.
There's another honeymoon couple?
Oh my goodness!
I heard there was an event the hotel prepared for honeymooning couples.
I thought it was going to be real lame.
Isn't it really romantic?!
Our fates are really entwined, don't you think?
We should have just come together from the airport.
We had a really hard time finding it.
I'm not too good with roads.
Is that all?!
But both of you look young.
Yes, we're 21.
Oh we're the same age!
It is really our fate!
But you got married real early.
Yes well...
Shotgun wedding?
We're 11 years apart, but it looks more doesn't it?
- Please have some.
- Yes.
You're even good at pouring wine.
Since we're the same age shall we talk informally?
Do as you wish.
Are you taking a shot?!
I don't know too much about drinking wine.
Ah, slowly!
Slowly!
I think I'm going to throw up.
Why did you drink so much?
Are you alright?
Here you go pork chopped noodles.
Ah!
Give me a fork please!
A fork?
Do you think this is spaghetti?!
There's a way to eat all foods.
Noodles like this you use chopsticks and go whoosh whoosh.
You need to eat it like that to get the full taste!
Here.
I don't know how to use chopsticks.
Didn't you say your mother is Korean?
Haven't you learned how to use chopsticks?
Look!
Chopsticks...
You need to know the fundamentals. Fundamentals, okay?
Do you know what fundamentals are?
What?
You place the chopstick like this and you only add pressure to here and here.
And the other one you hang it off of here.
And you just move this one like this.
Where in the world are you looking when I'm here explaining it to you?
Here. Not like that, over here.
-Here, here!
-Here!
That's right.
Wow the building looks unique.
They made it after the Great Mosque of Djenn√©.
Djenn√©?
It's an Islamic mosque in western Africa.
It's the biggest adobe building in the world.
Oh adobe.
Wow!
How could they build such a big building with adobe?
Once a year they paint the adobe.
You see that thing sticking out?
Yes.
They step on that to climb up--
Oh I see.
How do you know so much, Seung Jo?
Is it because you are a medical student?
It'll be fun if we go around together.
I'm going to follow you around like crazy.
Ah!
Are you alright?
Do you know you downed two bottles of wine all on your own last night?
Ah!
Really?
That's really interesting, right?
Look at this!
It's so pretty.
Right?
I am sorry!
Over there, over there!
Hurry!
This place is so fun!
Over there!
Should we go over there?
Look here!
Yes!
If you're the husband, take care of your wife!
Why am I stuck in this situation because of your wife?!
I am sorry , Miss Ha Ni!
Truthfully, I am worried too.
Seung Jo is after my wife.
What?
Seung Jo?
Seung Jo isn't into women like that!
Especially ones that force themselves like that.
Women like that?!
Force herself?!
My Hyun Ah is friendly and very affectionate.
She's misunderstood like that a lot, but she's a genuinely nice girl.
She's too good for me!
Omo!
Those two match really well.
Once we're done here do you want to head to the other museum?
I hear it's totally fun there.
Let's go to see!
Let's go!
-Oh, I am sorry!
-What is this?
Wow!
It is really cute!
Should we buy this for Eun Jo?
I don't think we need to buy it for him.
Put it down.
Did you see me looking at you?!
Oh, really!
I'm here now!
Then you should have dressed better!
What in the world is this?!
We went to so many places today.
I don't know how many museums we went to.
Aren't you tired?
You had to drive too.
Want to wash up first?
Oh!
Shall I?
What do I do!
The time has finally come.
What to do?
Who is it?
It is me.
Open the door, please.
What is it?
Let's have some champagne.
This is really good stuff. &lt;i&gt;Brought to you by the PKer team @ www.viiikii.net
Hello.
You're a bit late.
Would you like a glass of wine?
That's okay.
Have a nice time
Today's the last day.
What is this?
We haven't even been able to take a single picture yet.
You probably don't have to worry about that.
Huh?
Why?
I didn't have time to be with you, only us two.
So, let's hang around with only us two for today, okay?
Okay.
Truly?
I look pretty!
This is why he married me I guess
Seung Jo.
Seung Jo.
What is it? Who is it?
I wonder.
Seung Jo.
Please help.
It hurts.
It hurts.
Where does it hurt?
I don't know.
It hurts all over.
Hyun Ah...
Just hold on.
Is it here?
No, I don't think it's over there.
Then, here?
Here? &lt;i&gt;No, don't touch her. &lt;i&gt;Stop.
How about here?
Here, this is where it hurts.
Stop It!
Don't touch a woman like that!
Oh Ha Ni.
What are you doing now?
I don't like it when you touch some other woman's body.
I don't like that.
Oh Ha Ni!
You married a person that's going to be become a doctor.
What are you going to do if you're jealous of a sick person?
Because I've touched them?!
Aren't you even embarrassed?
If you don't like it, then you cannot live with me.
Do you understand?
Miss Ha Ni!
Hurry up and go follow her.
What the!
Gospodiƒçna Ha Ni!
Finally, its only us two.
Seung Jo, you don't like Ha Ni right?
You don't want to touch her either, do you?
How unfortunate.
You should have met me before Ha Ni.
If that's the case,
Then,
I wouldn't have even glanced at you probably.
What?
I have no choice but to deal with you because of where we are right now.
Don't you dare compare something like you to Ha Ni.
I couldn't catch her.
I thought you wanted it to be just the two of us?
So why are you leaving on your own?
Are you still angry?
Put yourself in my shoes.
It would be weird not to get angry.
But you're pretty when you smile.
When you smile I start to feel good.
It tickles!
Hey, stop it!
Don't!
Don't! I'm sorry
I'm sorry. That I acted stupid.
Getting jealous at those things...
Dork.
You're cute. Every now and then.
There are also times when you're beautiful. From time to time.
But ...
Why do I like you?
You're not that pretty and you're only cute now and then.
Why would I always miss you?
You...
What did you do to me?
Hey...
Wait a minute...
I have something to prepare...
Prepare what? See... A girl has things to prepare--
It's fine.
I can't wait any longer.
Good morning!
Why? You should have slept more.
You must be tired.
I'm sorry.
What happened?
The alarm went off at 5am.
I was looking forward to what you would make for breakfast.
Hyung you can rethink all this.
Ha Ni, you sit down too.
Do you want to wash up before you eat?
Yes.
I'm sorry.
Absolutely no need for that!
You're going to the library, right?
I'll be quick so lets go together.
Going to study to get into the nursing program?
Yes.
The son will be a doctor and the daughter-in-law a nurse.
That's so great!
Well I can't take the certification until I get into the program.
If I don't then I may not be able to take it at all.
Oh really?!
Just because she takes it doesn't mean she's going to pass.
She's better off not being able to take it.
Baek Eun Jo fix that mouth of yours!
She's your sister-in-law now.
Oh that's right!
We have to register your marriage!
Well...
What kind of reply is that?
I know you're busy, but there are priorities you know!
Hey Ha Ni later go with Seung Jo and--
I'll think about it first.
What?!
Think about what?!
About putting her on our family register.
I want to wait and see.
Is that something to say for someone that just came back from their honeymoon?!
That was something that you forced on us, Mother.
Baek Seung Jo does any of this make any sense?!
Thank God Ha Ni's father isn't here!
What is it that you want to think over?
Well...
I don't know but something isn't right at all.
It just feels like we're rushing through it all.
You don't want that either right?
Is that so...
Then what do we do?
Changing your major to nursing.
Let's register once you pass the test to change majors.
What does that have to do with your marriage registration?!
No way!
What?
Are you not confident?
You jumped into it and this is it?
No that's not it.
There's a chance I may not be able to take it at all!
I'm sure it'll happen, some day. &lt;i&gt;Thanks to the amazing PKer team for all their hard work today. Thank you to all the viewers who waited until the channel went green for GO to watch this episode.
What?
You won't put me on your family register until I pass?!
We can just do it!
Family register.
I like you Mr. Bong!
What?!
It was love at first sight!
But Mr. Bong says he likes someone.
Is it true?
You must love it.
The old lady gets a scandal and everything.
By chance are you jealous?
You're jealous right?!
- I said I'm not!
- Whatever it totally is!
Ever since that day Chris isn't around much.
What the hell Bong Joon Gu?
Why are you here?!
Are you crazy?!
I applied to change majors!
If I pass this time then go on a date with me on Christmas.
Hey what are you doing?
- Come here.
- Hyung!
Yeah!
Yeah, Eun Jo!
Man, I'm going crazy because I want to go on a date with Oh Ha Ni!
I'm late!
&lt;i&gt;Brought to you by the PKer team @ www.viikii.net&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Episode 4
Is it that house?
That's enough, okay?
Hurry and leave!
If Baek Seung Jo sees us, we're dead.
Hurry, hurry.
Where's your room ?
Is it over there?
Or there?
Where is it?
Spare me, please!
It seems like it's over there.
Right there.
If that's Ha Ni's room, that one must be Baek Seung Jo's room?!
Please, please!
Spare me!
Just go already!
Ha Ni, you came?
You're here early!
Ah, yes.
Why aren't you coming in? Well, today is just...
Are they your friends ?
Ah, hello. Ah! You, you're Lady Gaga, right?
Oh, yes.
Aaah, the pizza lady!
That's right!
Ah!
Hello.
And you?
You're the friend who was in the relay.
Right?
Yes. Hello.
They were curious about where I'm living, but they're leaving now, right?
Bye!
Omo, go where?
Come in.
Okay.
Shall I make some strawberry Bingsu (a mixture of fruits, ice cream and shaved ice) for you? You can leave after you eat it.
Aigoo!
Aigoo!
Oh!
This looks really delicious!
Really?
You're just loving this, aren't you?
Oh!
Spreading rumors wasn't enough, so you even brought them here?
No, that's...
You should know I've already scolded her.
Is this your house?
I invited them in.
It's so much fun!
It feels like there are actually people living here.
But these friends asked me if I'm really your mom.
They asked if I'm not really your older sister.
Oh Ha Ni.
Are you testing my patience?
Oh?
I told you to stop doing this to me.
And not to interfere with my life anymore!
How far do you intend to go with this?
Just give it a rest!
What do you think you're doing now?
It was me who took that picture, and it was me who put that picture in the book without telling anyone.
Why are you scolding Ha Ni?!
You too, Mom, please!
Take down that blog right this instant.
Omo?
What makes you so mighty that you can tell me what to do with my hobby?
Is ruining your son's life really your hobby?
By chance, I heard what's going around school.
So what if rumors were to spread?
What's there to feel sorry about?
Then, we will... ...be leaving now.
Ah, why?
You should have dinner with us.
- Ah, no it's alright.
-Goodbye.
Ah, why?
You should stay and have dinner here!
Ah, right!
This weekend, we're going to the beach.
Let's go together!
Sorry?
But we have class this week.
Omo!
It's okay to miss just one day.
Oh!
It's going to be fun!
You girls only need to prepare your bathing suits because I'll prepare everything else!
Okay?!
Oh come on, please come on!
Don't ask me the reason.
Can't you just do it for me?
Why?
Did you mess something up again?!
No.
Perhaps, are you sick?
Ah no, I'm not sick at all.
Fine then.
How much do you need?
Ah, 1,000?
No, no. 2,000?
Ah, no, no. 3,000?!
Yes, 3,000 would be good!
Just think of it as spending money for my wedding just a little early.
I just need 3,000.
Will 3,000 be enough?
Yes, 3,000 will be fine!
Then, I'll give it to you!
Oh really?!
Thank you so much, Father!
But, why are you so worked up over 3,000 won (about $2.50)?
Ah, the truth is...
I wanted to get a room.
What?!
3,000, 3,000 won?
Father, are you kidding me right now?!
Kidding? You punk?!
You little ungrateful, shameless rascal!
Are you crazy?!
You little punk!
You want 30,000,000 won ($25,600)!?
Are you stupid? For what? To rent a room?
Don't waste your time on such unnecessary things and go do something productive.
I'm going to hang up now. HANG UP!
Don't you know that in order to protect your love you need to have money?
Aish!
Shut up!
Oh, what a fright!
Would you move from there?
That is my place, young man.
Oh! What's this, ahjussi?
So smelly!
Why did you lose your love, young one?
Because of money?
Forget it!
Just go back to sleep!
Love is lonely because fate is on the line.
One puts everything on the line, which is why it's lonely.
What?
When living life is hard and you feel alone,
love is what makes such a world look beautiful.
Excuse me?
You say that because you don't realize how lonely that kind of love makes oneself.
But... ...does that mean you should give up on love? Such a bright youth!
Wouldn't you feel sorry towards (Van) Gogh who lived his life more unhappily than we do ours?
What?
Gogh?
Do you know about Gogh's love?
Putting everything you have on the line.
To have no regrets despite losing everything.
You must be able to do that in order to really say that you've been in love.
Wait, wait!
Can't you tell me anything else?!
That's right!
Bong Joon Gu.
Can you really say your love has been tested by fate?
You still haven't even properly confessed your feelings to Ha Ni!
And even if you had, what would be the point?
To not regret loving despite losing everything.
Listen carefully to what I have to say.
While you've been living here there's something I've really come to hate.
People with a bad head, like you, who aren't able to take in the situation, let alone understand their own situation, acting as if they know what's going on and bothering other people.
Don't make me repeat myself.
What I said about you being out of your mind wasn't just empty words. &lt;i&gt;Because of the letter, &lt;i&gt;he embarrassed me in front of all those students and teachers.
It's totally understandable.
He has every right to do so.
He must be thinking that I planned everything out.
(Sigh!)
I said that's not how it is!
If I were him, I would be really angry too!
It must've been a pretty big shock.
Alright, bye!
Oh Ha Ni?
Are you Oh Ha Ni?
I hate stupid girls. &lt;i&gt;Brought to you by the PKer team @ www.viikii.net&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;I don't know when it was, &lt;i&gt;Ever since I first saw you, &lt;i&gt;Every minute, every second, I keep thinking about you. &lt;i&gt;What you are doing... &lt;i&gt; Where you are right now.
Thank you. &lt;i&gt;Even when I try looking here and there, &lt;i&gt; And stomp on this and that. &lt;i&gt; I keep on liking you, I think I'm going crazy, Ooh. &lt;i&gt; I wonder if you know how I feel,
I'm telling you not to interfere with my life anymore!
How far do you want to keep going with this?!
Will you give it up!? &lt;i&gt; Every day stay by my side and protect me. &lt;i&gt; I love you too much for us to be just friends. &lt;i&gt; So can you please tell me that one word, I love you right now? &lt;i&gt;I love every day, only love me, &lt;i&gt; Please kiss me.
It really looks pretty! Um.
How is it?
Hi!
Seung Jo, you came down.
They said they're ready and that we should come out.
Oh, really?
Then shall we get going?
Seung Jo, you too.
Put your bag down and quickly come with us!
Go?
Go where?
We're going camping for two days and one night.
I present you...
Auto-Camping.
What?
What about school?
I already called them.
Hyung, I've been kidnapped!
I woke up and found myself in the car!
Come out quickly.
That is the only way to save his life.
Quickly!
I've already packed your luggage.
Your bathing suit too!
You are too much, seriously.
Who is it?!
Ha Ni!
This girl suddenly says she's coming too.
Hello!
I'm comming too!
Who is she?
Hey.
What is this?
Why isn't she here yet?
None of them are here.
Argh, really!
Good morning!
Nothing going on, right?
Teacher, Ha Ni isn't here yet!
Go Min Ah isn't here either.
Jung Ju Ri as well!
They've all gone to have fun.
They said they're going to the beach!
Jealous, right?!
Gone to have fun you said?
Teacher, do you know how scary this world is?!
How could you allow three girls to go to the beach alone?!
It wasn't just the girls; they all went with Baek Seung Jo's family.
Did you say Baek...BAEK SEUNG JO?!
Just kill me instead!
Kill me!
What?
They went on a trip?!
And to add to that, for one night and two days?!
What am I going to do?
Am I going to have to earn some money?
Argh!
What to do now?
What is it, Bong Joon Gu?
You, did you just get here?!
That's not it, Sir.
I'm in a rush and am leaving early.
Leaving early?!
Vice Principal, you see...
Aigoo, my aunt got into a traffic accident so suddenly!
I have to go really quickly now.
R-really? Then hurry up and go.
Ah yes.
Aigoo, but although I have to go really quickly, I have no money!
Can I borrow this just this once?
Aigoo, this?!
Yes. They said she might pass away any second!
Man, even if this is a piece of crap, it's still something!
The heavens are definitely on my side!
Ha Ni, I'm coming!
Okay, kids, raise your hands!
Quickly cross the road! It's dangerous.
Aigoo, how cute they are!
Alright, let's go!
Oppa!
Oppa!
Oh.
What is it?
We just opened right next to the subway station.
Here.
Be sure to come and have fun!!
But I'm still a student.
Many university students come as well.
But, Oppa, you're really cute.
Ah, yes, thank you.
You should definitely come!
Massage Palace?
Eh?
What's that?
Protect the youth.
Is this a good thing?
Yaah, really!
Let's go!
Ah.
Oppa, do you want to eat some watermelon?
I cut it up nicely so it's easy to eat!
There's a ridiculous amount of watermelon in the fridge.
Oh, but mine is super sweet!
It tastes like honey!
A watermelon should taste like watermelon.
If it tastes like honey, how could it be watermelon?
Wouldn't it be honey?!
So, how did you know we were going to the beach?
Everyone has their ways.
First, you need to have a bathing suit.
Ah, also hairspray and a hairdryer and...
And what else?
Ha Ni, do you have a swimsuit?
Yeah.
I bought it last year, remember?
Hey!
Just buy a new one!
Omo, there is even a Noraebang (Karaoke) there?
Should we try out a song, Oppa?!
What is this, a tour bus?
Why would you sing?
Then should we play the "End Letter" game?!
Huh?
Why that?
It's so childish!
Omo!
That's a great idea!
Ha Ni, you really thought well!
Then, let's have the topic be four character sayings!
Mi Na first!
Ee Shim Jun Shim!
(tactic understanding)
Ee Shim Jun Shim?
"Shim"?
Ooh...
"Shim Shim Pur Ee!
(to kill time)
Is "kill time" a four character saying, Mom?
Of course!
Shim Shim Pur Ee!
Hurry up and do it, if you don't you'll be punished!!
You'll have to write your name with your butt!
You're really immature!
One, two...
Ee Shil Jik Go!
(telling the truth!)
Seung Jo.
Ah!
Are you really doing this?
One, two!
Go...
"Go Jang Nan Myeong" ("It takes two to tango" or "One needs help to accomplish anything")
"GojangNanMyeong"?
What does that mean?
It should just be Go Jang Nan Cha! (broken car) instead.
He didn't say "Go Jang Nan Byung" (broken disease), he said "Go Jang Nan Myeong"!
"Go Jang Nan Myeong".
It means you can't make sound with just one hand!
Oh.
You're so smart!
Did you guys get that?
So stupid!
Yu Yu Sang Jong!
(Birds of a feather flock together!)
Hey!
Hurry and go.
"Go Jang Nan Myeong"!
- One - Myeong, Myeong?
Two.
"Myeong Myeong Baek Baek!"
(Crystal clear!)
Baek?
Baek.
One.
Wait a second.
What starts with Baek?
Baek?!
Two.
Three!
"Baek Seung Jo Jjang!"
(Baek Seung Jo is the best!)
You wanted to say those words so badly, that's why you asked to play this game, right?!
No.
Are you crazy?!
It's just that there were no other words! &lt;i&gt;Brought to you by the PKer team @ www.viikii.net
Is it ready?!
Aigoo, thank you!
Whoa!
This is great!
Kids, come get some drinks!
Yes!
I should have bought Ha Ni a bikini!
She looks pure and pretty!
A high school girl's charm is her innocence.
- Oh. - Oh.
What's that, Oh Ha Ni?!
You have to use a tube?!
I don't even need one.
Yeah, I can't swim very well.
Seung Jo, does Ha Ni look pretty? And innocent!
Doesn't she look like a high school student?
She looks like an elementary student.
You're pretty, Ha Ni.
You're the prettiest!
That's right.
Ha Ni is the prettiest.
Our Ha Ni is in bikini season.
"Best"!
I mean best.
I forgot.
You need these.
What is this!
They're socks.
Why did he give these to you? &lt;i&gt;What is that?
They look like socks.
God, I will kill that guy today and go to hell!
HEY!!
Ha Ni!
Oh, Ha Ni!
Are you okay?
Are you okay?
Nothing happened, right?
Those socks were for you to wear.
Aren't you going to come here?
BAEK SEUNG JO!!
What is this?
What's wrong with you?
Why is this suddenly being like this?!
Has it already lived its life? We're almost there, so why are you being like this?
Aish!
Is it out of gas?
I don't have any money, what will I do?
Really! Is there any gas?
Let's see, let's see. Is it there, or is it empty?
It's too dark, I can't see anything.
Ah, that's right.
Aish.
Oh, what's up with this?
This is interesting.
Here.
Let's see, let's see.
Here.
Oh!
Dad, what is that?
Don't know. Did it fall from the sky?!
No.
I'm taking the picture!
Kimchi!
Is it done?!
Yeah!
Next time, we should ask someone else to take the photo.
Go Mi didn't come.
Seung Jo Oppa!
Hyung!
Oh.
Well done!
Man.
That dung fly, Hong Jang Mi, is getting in the way.
I absolutely hate her!
Look at that!
Kids! Let's eat some watermelon!
I think she's calling us!
Ha Ni!
Come!
Let's go!
I'm so hungry! The watermelon looks yummy!
Oh.
Wait just a second!
Hey!
Bbong (padding) Ha Ni!
What? Stop kidding around!
Bbong!
A tree goes plop and farts, "Bbong!!"
HEY!
Really now. Baek Eun Jo! &lt;i&gt;Bbong bboro bbong bbong, bbong bbong!
You really, to your Noona?! &lt;i&gt;Bbong bboro bbong bbong, bbong bbong!&lt;/i&gt;
What?!
I'll scold you!
HEY! What's wrong with you?
Try and catch me! Just try.
Come in.
You can't swim, can you?!
Just try and come!
HEY!
Baek Eun Jo.
Just try and come out!
Hey!
Are you faking this?!
You've got to better than that if you're just fooling around.
HELP ME!
HELP ME, PLEASE! What?!
Is this real?!
Hey!
Baek Eun Jo!
Hey! Someone fell in the water!
Someone help!
Dad!
After telling them to come eat watermelon, they go right back in.
Their maturity level is the same.
They're just innocent!
Honey, our throats are getting dry!
Watermelon for me, too!!
I'll give you watermelon.
Here's some.
Say "ah".
Eat some watermelon!
What?!
They fell?!?!
What?!
Honey, what's going on?!
What?!
Hey!
Ha Ni!
Ha Ni!
Just stay still!
Eun Jo!
Eun Jo!
Are you alright?!
Are you okay?!
Eun Jo!
You're okay?!
Yes?!
Our son!
Wow! This looks so good!
Seung Jo.
Go give Ha Ni some water.
Warm water.
I'll go give it to her.
Oh no, no!
Jang Mi, you cook the beef.
Pardon?
Baek Seung Jo, quickly!
My goodness.
Are you okay, Ha Ni?!
You don't have to go to the hospital?
No. You were scared, weren't you?
Of course!
I was so surprised, my heart is still pounding.
It had to be when I was under the sand.
It's okay.
I came right out.
What do you mean "it's okay"?
I couldn't move because of the sand, but there you were right in front of me flailing around!
At that moment, I was thinking...
"This is what they call hell."
I'm sorry, Dad.
Do you want some water?
Seung Jo, thank you so much.
If you hadn't been there, what would have happened?
It was nothing.
For that, I will pay you back with a killer dinner.
You can't swim and without fear...
What was I supposed to do?
Even when I yelled, no one could hear me.
You are an accident prone troublemaker.
I haven't had a days rest since meeting you.
Why are you being mean again?
I'm still sick.
Sick...
Who... Who are you?
Where is my Ha Ni?
Is it all ready?
Yes.
Then, all of the men go to the tent!
What about Eun Jo?
Since Eun Jo's sick, he has to sleep with me.
Yes.
Yes.
Children!
Wow, it's our sleeping quarters.
Wow, this is great!
I get top bunk.
Wow, jackpot!
So great!
I call this spot!
It really changed!
Go, go, go!
You got the top bunk.
Must be nice!
Must be nice!
You're not tired?
I'm okay.
What?
Hey, hey, you took one!
Hey! &lt;i&gt;Brought to you by the Pker team @ www.viikii.net
You know how to play guitar too?
I borrowed some of your clothes.
Okay.
I heard that you saved Ha Ni.
I should have come a little earlier.
Well, I guess you did your fair share.
Did you come all the way here because of Oh Ha Ni?
Of course I did!
I don't care what a stiff genius you are; you're still a puberty stricken 18 year old!
I don't know when you'll turn into a beast, so I've got to watch you day and night.
Why?
You should just move into our house then.
Do you have an empty room?
I'm warning you!
Don't you dare make a move on her!
Remember that I'm always watching from somewhere.
Got it?
You like Oh Ha Ni that much?
Man, if you ask me that directly, it's a bit overwhelming.
Whatever I become, I need to hurry up and get a job.
My dream is to make Ha Ni happy.
Yeah.
You guys look good together, you and Oh Ha Ni.
Really?
You think so?
You're different than what I thought, Baek Seung Jo.
Definitely different.
Yeah, really different.
You have some taste.
Yeah.
Ha Ni doesn't look good with you.
Doesn't matter how much Ha Ni likes you.
That'll end in good time.
Huh.
Baek Seung Jo, should we be friends?
No.
Why?
Okay, okay.
Do whatever you want.
I don't need a friend like you.
As long as I have Ha Ni, I'm good.
Hey, sing a song. &lt;i&gt;Once again, he has come a long way in order to protect you. &lt;i&gt;Playful Kiss.
Ha Ni.
It was great when we were playing.
Seriously.
There are so many colleges, we'll get into one, right?
Of course.
We still have two months left.
We can do it.
Is this arrogance I see because you got into the top fifty within a week?
It's not that.
Ah!
You guys should be playing at this age. What kind of suffering is this?
So sad.
It is, huh?
You feel really sad for us, don't you?
We'll eat well.
Thank you very much.
Kids, if there's something you don't know, ask him.
What else would you use a smart kid for?
Fighting.
Fighting.
Thank you.
Did you see?
Her face is the size of my fist.
Whoa.
Ha Ni, this is no joke for you.
No.

Give it to me!
Ha Ni!
Hey, what are you doing?
I thought Baek Seung Jo was really skinny, but ever since we went on the trip, I found out he's a man.
Oh.
He must work out.
His back muscles look really firm.
Hey.
Even talking about him gets you excited?!
You like him that much?
Ah, really.
Study, study!
Right.
Number 1.
1/4 of this...
That's the equation.
The answer...
What are you talking about?
Should we start with number 2?
What?
What? &lt;i&gt;What?&lt;/i&gt;
Hurry and go.
Hurry, hurry, hurry.
Get up, get up.
Yes?
Eun Jo, not there, but higher.
Here?
Excuse me.
Do you have a bit of time?
No.
Right?
Okay.
Hi!
What the heck, Oh Ha Ni?!
You see, I'm studying with my friends and there's a problem we don't understand.
We just can't seem to get it.
I don't want to.
Come on, it won't even take you a minute.
30 seconds, just 30 seconds!
Even 30 seconds is a waste of my time.
A waste of your time?
Our lives depend on your 30 seconds.
At least you speak well.

Let's go for the next one!
Excuse me.
Excuse me.
Just one more.
You're going to sleep?
The next equation as well...
I'm sorry!
Hey!
Come back in 15 minutes!
Try going in.
Yeah, it's been 15 minutes...
I'm scared.
Hurry up!
I just can't do it!
Hurry up and go in!
Oh my, oh my!
Are you happy?!
Don't you dare come near my room now!
Ah, I see.
What if I actually get into a university like this?!
It would be nice if he could help with our other subjects too.
That's right!
We have free time this week!
Are you out of your minds?!
How can you ask that after seeing how he reacted last night?
Hey.
What's this?
Wow!
Hey, what are you doing?!
Why are you bothering Ha Ni?
Oh Ha Ni.
Who solved these for you?
Baek Seung Jo worked them out for you, didn't he?
I heard you two live together.
No, that is...
Move it, move it, move it!
That's right, the god, Baek Seung Jo solved them!
Why?
Are you guys jealous?!
You guys study with Baek Seung Jo?!
What is it?
What are they talking about?
Oh Ha Ni.
Let me in too.
Huh?
Me too!
Me too!

What are you talking about?
Don't you guys have any pride?!

What?!
Does pride get you into university?
What?!
Pride?!
You little!
You're supposed to study on your own!
Who are you asking to teach you?!
Isn't that right?
Right, right?
Hey, you, yellow head!
You're going to go too?
Just look at them!
Fine! Go, go!
Oh really?

Jeez!

No way.
I'm a bit tired.
Dear, where are you going?
Mom is so very happy!
That my son, can be of help to someone like this.
You're happy?!
Hey, Oh Ha Ni!
You better come out!
Just this once?
Oh Ha Ni, you really...
Save our class, just this once!
I will never forget your kindness!
We'll never forget!
Please help us!
Please save us!
The object on the ground, has a mass of 2 kilograms.
If 10 newtons of force are applied, with a frictional force of 4 newtons, what is the highest speed this object can reach?
With this problem, you use the equation of F = ma.
Ahhh~
If F = ma, what is F?
Force. M is mass.
Ah.
A is acceleration.
Oh, I see!
What we're looking for is the value of "a".
Therefore A = F/M.
In this case, force is 10 newtons and mass is 2 kilograms.
Oh?
I'll do the dishes!
I'm all done.
Your friends left?
I told you to have them over for dinner.
I couldn't.
You even made lunch for all of them.
Do you think studying is going to get you anywhere?
Baek Eun Jo, that's a yellow card for you.
One more time and you're out.
What should we have for dinner?
Sweet and sour pork!
No way!
It seems like Seung Jo doesn't like sweet and sour pork very much.
When we have it for lunch, he barely eats any of it.
I like it!
That's right.
Seung Jo doesn't really like it.
I said that I like it!
Are you tired?
Obviously.
Water?
You want water?!
This one is cold.
Never mind.
Here.
Oh, really!
That one was just put in.
Stop.
Hello.
Yes!
What's happening?
Really?
What should I do?
I'll leave right away!
Yes.
I'm hanging up.
What should I do?
What am I going to do?
What should I do?
What to do, what to do?
My husband is going to go straight there as well!
So you two figure out your own dinners, alright?
- Why isn't Hyung going?
- Hyung has to study, he's a senior.
Don't come out!
You two stay here!
Hey. Hurry.
Sorry, Ha Ni.
Bye. &lt;i&gt;Brought to you by the PKer team @ www.viikii.net&lt;/i&gt;

"...place a thick patty of meat."
"Pour a generous amount..." "...of gravy sauce."
"Place a sunny side up fried egg on top."
"The point is to dip the meat in the yolk."
Awesome!
Baek Seung Jo, you're going to be absolutely amazed.
What?
The big problem was this?
Mom's good at acting, isn't she?
The bank lady called.
She must be wondering what I was talking about.
You told me to come here all of a sudden, so I thought something had happened too.
But something did happen.
Her whole class came over.
Oh really.
Hey, Ha Ni is something else.
That's what I said.
Ha Ni, she's got strength.
She's got bad grades.
All she has is strength.
Hey, you rascal!
Are you just going to keep saying what's true?
Oh, that picture?
We took it right in front here, when we were going to start remodeling the restaurant.
It was around the time my wife passed away so Ha Ni must have been... ...it was when she was four years old.
You're not interested in getting remarried?
Well, if someone as great as you appears.
But really, if Ha Ni gets married, you'll be lonely by yourself.
Married?
Just hearing the word brings tears to my eyes.
There's no need for that!
We can live together!
Huh?
Then again, I don't know if we should leave those two alone like that.
I left the two home on purpose.
The air between those two seemed so bad.
Guys and girls, if they're alone, it all works itself out naturally.
Hey, are you going to give me food or not?
Hey, what's happening?
I'm sorry.
It' got slightly burned.
This burnt thing, what is it supposed to be?
Hawaiian Loco Moco.
Hawaiian what?
Loco Moco.
This is only slightly burned?
This isn't dinner, this is just mush.
Why?
You don't like mush?
Hey!
Are you telling me to eat this right now?
When do we spray this on?
Just bring the water.
Yes.
Wow.
It's amazing.
It's just like the ones in a restaurant.
It's really good!
How did you cook the egg so it's so soft?
And so quickly!
It didn't even take 30 minutes.
Because I'm smart.
Huh?
Cooking is all smarts too.
Ah, really?
Then my dad must be super smart.
Then is Bong Joon Gu smart too?
Joon Gu is really good at cooking too.
No way.
It's true.
He sold Dduk Bokk Gi and Ma Tang for the festival and it was totally good.
Hey!
Is making Dduk Bokk Gi cooking?
It is. Those types of food are the hardest.
The dishes that are eaten by a lot of people, it's hard to accommodate each person's tastes.
Even the Ma Tang, the outside was really crispy and the inside so very soft.
You know how typically it's really mushy and sticky--
You're already done?
I only had a spoonful!
Clean it all up, and do the dishes too!
I really only had one bite.

I can't, I have an important English test.
I've got to prepare for it.
Don't worry about me and have fun.

Though he's always so fussy, he still does everything.
Where did my English book go?!
Why is that the only one missing?

What will I do?
I'm going to get made fun of so much!
Oh, yeah!
He's sleeping.
You rascal, so nice of you!
Where is it?
He sleeps so beautifully.
What is this?
He only reads the original editions?
Why are you acting like a thief?
That's not it.
I had to look for something.
Do you expect me to believe that?
Of all times, when no one was in the house but the two of us, you suddenly have something to look for?
What?
No.
Really.

Hi!
How are you doing?
Justin here.
Welcome to IM-138 which is the "Just Use Sound To Improve Now" section.
Now what we're doing this time, we've got a couple of new things.
The first thing in 3A: we're going to be checking out just major barre chords.
This is for the chord progression transcription. Now, I'll just be using . . .
E shape major barre chords . . . and A shape major barre chords.
And the idea here of course: you need to find the root note and then... the kind of the part of the challenge this time is figuring out whether a chord is being played with a six-string root or a fifth-string root.
Because now if you start to listen to, say, a B-chord, this is a B-chord with an E shape barre chord . . . and this is a B chord with an A shape barre chord. . . . and you can kinda hear they're different because the E shape (plays) uses all of the strings.
All the six strings are ringing, and you get the high note at the top as well.
With the A shape . . . you don't have as high a note at the top.
So what I want you to do is when you're doing the transcriptions for that, find the root note and then see if you can work out which chord shape it is.
So listen closely to what I'm playing, on the...- because of course you have got to listen to the mp3 and all that, and this isn't the lesson, the lesson part is the listening to the audio track and then listen to is it this one (plays) or this one? (plays)
Or if it's an F chord, is it this one (plays) or is it this one? (plays) So, play one and play the other and I'm sure, it will be kind of obvious which one it is.
So that's the important thing we're just dealing with majors, don't think there's any minors that I'm going to sneak in there's just majors, so really listening to whether it's a sixth string root or a fifth string root.
Very important lesson that one.
For 3B we're transcribing an eighth note solo.
It's using, in fact using the A-minor pentatonic scale.
We've just got a little bit more rhythmic interest in it now.
So if you're going to have a listen to it, it's still just the A minor pentatonic.
So you know,
I'm already telling you what the notes are, where you can find the notes easily.
If you can, a really cool thing to do would be to add the rhythm to the tab, so tab out the notes first and then add a rhythm above the notes.
Now we've already done enough rhythmic dictation in the last two foundation levels for you to be able to do that.
So you should have the skills, so let's see if you can apply that rhythmic dictation skills now to a lead guitar that you're going to transcribe.
Because that's kind of really a part, a big part of the point, really, for this rhythmic dictation is being able to apply to tabs when you're transcribing your own solos.
Very, very useful skill, indeed.
And for 3C it's almost exactly the same as 2C was, but a little bit more tricky.
So we've got a few more syncopated bits so more rests that are going to fall on the beat and therefore more notes that are NOT on the beat.
So, hopefully you've got a little bit more of an idea of how to write these rhythms down from the last foundation.
So if you're stuck you can check out my "Understanding Rhythmic Notation" PDF book thing, which I co-wrote with my friend Justin Scott, who's a drummer, really good rhythm teacher, so that might be worth checking out if you're really getting into this rhythmic dictation.
Very very valuable skill rhythmic dictation being able to understand rhythms.
Teaches you a lot about your rhythm guitar skills as well.
Very, very useful thing to do.
But, as I, as the title suggests, just use sound to improve now, so i'm not going to teach you now in this video lesson.
I want you to go and download those mp3s, download the worksheets, and get stuck into learning just by using your ears.
Have fun with that.
See you for another lesson sometime real soon.
In 926, the capital of Balhae fell to Georan.
On the territory Georan founded a new country called Dongranguk, which means 'Georan of East'.
The survivals of Balhae, however, kept struggling fiercely to restore their country.
In 927, Autumn
A raid by the Killer-Blade Army of Dongranguk!
Form a defense line!
Don't give an inch, just fight back!
Gunhwapyeong!
I'm honored.
The commander of the Killer-Blade Army has come to pay a personal visit.
I came all the way to ask you something.
Wouldn't you rather cooperate with Dongranguk?
I'm a human being.
You want me to be a dog for Georan, like you?
Any last words?
I'm sad to announce that even our future king, Prince Suhyeon, has been assassinated by Gunhwapyeong.
Gunhwapyeong, that traitor is killing off everyone from the royal family, cutting off the lineage.
Son of a Bitch!
I heard the news has spread all over, hurting the morale of the people.
It's a big problem.
We need a king at a time like this.
With Prince Suhyeon dead, who can become our king?
Who else is left?
I've found a prince whose whereabouts were unknown.
Oh, is there a prince?
Who is he?
Do you remember Prince Jeonghyeon?
What happened?
As you ordered, I sent Maeyoungok and Mabul to Jungwon.
Youngok...
She always works hard.
According to a secret agent,
Balhae has also dispatched an excellent fighter...
Who's that?
We don't know yet.
Does anybody have any idea who it could be?
This time you have to go far.
He's the son of LADY OH.
He was involved in some political strife 14 years ago, and sent to Jungwon.
He was exiled.
The Killer-Blade Army will be coming.
We must find him before the they do.
We must have a king to unite our people.
If we can unite our people and soldiers, instead of fighting all over the place, we can never lose...
Don't forget that.
Balhae's fate depends on him.
How was today?
What about the girl?
- Sosam?
- Yes.
What have you got?
What do you need to sell?
I'll meet the gentleman first and tell him.
Gentleman?
Sit over there and wait.
There's no need to doubt.
Just tell me how much you can pay.
There are others who are doing this kind of business.
Why did you come to me?
I heard there's no later trouble with you.
No trouble when dealing with Sosam.
That's right.
The important thing is whether there will be trouble or not.
The price is the next concern.
So, how much are you asking?
Fifty jeon...
You rat!
That's too cheap!
Is about right, but I'll give you up to 80 jeon.
Fine.
Hey, Sosam, well...
I'm not sure where you heard of me but you found the right person.
It's very important who you deal with here.
You have to find a credible person...
I have a question to ask you.
What is your honorable name?
You were looking for Sosam.
I'm asking for your real name.
There are too many eyes here.
Follow me.
What you have, only two of them were existed.
I thought I've been seeing strangers lately.
Your Highness, there must be a misunderstanding.
I'd never misunderstand assassins.
Do me a favor.
Hey, Sosam.
That's no favor...
I thank you.
Don't worry and just go!
A misunderstanding?
Aren't you going to follow him?
I don't think anything I say will matter right now.
Please, you guys need to help me.
Before that, you must help us first.
We're desperate.
I don't think so
All I have learned is how to kill.
No need to talk to you.
Kill her.
I said "I don't think so".
Okay, okay!
Understood.
I would like to know something.
There is so called "Rules" on the back street.
I know 10 ways to make you speak.
But, I'm not sure you can bear it.
Calm down.
I'm willing to give out everything.
Please sit down.
I'm Yeon Soha, officer first class of Biseonwon.
Please forgive my discourtesy, Your Highness.
Of course, I have to forgive in this situation.
I don't know why you think so, but I'm not an assassin.
- All the other princes are... are no more.
They'll leave an exiled prince alive?
- What if other princes...
Your Highness!
You must become the king of Balhae.
I will be escorting you to Balhae.
I've lived in a place like this, hiding from assassins for 14 years.
And now that painful time is all gone and I am to be the king of Balhae, right?
Do you think I believe that?
OK.
Let's say that's all true.
Do you think I'm crazy?
That's only a title.
You're saying that I should become the king to be chased by Georan, not knowing when I will be killed?
Do you know what I believe in?
"Survival, above all else."
That's all I'm interested in.
Your Highness!
My kids came back almost all crippled, which means I lose face.
What are we supposed to do now, huh?
I didn't do it.
Did I say you did it, Prince?
You ain't from battle field, are you?
Tell me.
About what?
Tell me the details so I can decide on the price.
How much money will you bring me when I hand you over?
Always the same routine...
They need to be beaten to start speaking.
You...
Stop!
She...
She's the one!
She attacked us!
Welcome.
I've heard interesting stories about your skills.
I'm the boss of...
I told you to take your hands off of him.
Not gonna work.
You should talk to me.
I'm the boss of...
Oh, Shit!
Your Highness, are you okay?
What's going on?
They're on the same team!
Please don't worry.
I will protect you.
Bo...
Boss...
Yeon Soha...
It's you.
You came here.
We've passed a couple of times, but this is the first time we've said hello.
What do we do?
There are more than two of them now.
Don't worry.
This is our region.
And we've got more people.
Who are they now?
They're Dongranguk's Killer-Blade army.
Officer Yeon, wouldn't it be better if we avoided any unnecessary killings?
Give us Prince Jeonghyeon and we'll guarantee your life.
I can never allow you to take him.
It's not going to work by talking.
Everyone stop!
What?
Looking at the current situation, I think you're the one we should join up with.
Get out!
Lt'll be better to talk.
I'm the boss of...
What are we doing?
Kill them!
Your Highness, please run!
What?
We have to run away.
Hurry!
What is the matter?
Your Highness!
They'll keep coming.
You have to keep away from them!
Follow me!
Tell me.
Who are you?
What do you have to do with the Killer-Blade Army?
Most of them are traitors to Balhae.
In the past, I've seen them in the military.
Is that why you introduced yourself like that?
Is there something wrong with how I introduced myself?
Then, how are you related to my brother Suhyeon?
I've once guarded the Crown Prince for a while.
We must go now.
Where to?
This is the safest place.
There is no safe place.
As long as we are here, they'll eventually find you.
They will kill everyone on Wolnak street if they need to...
That is the Killer-Blade army's way.
Didn't you say that surviving is your only interest?
Then there's no other way.
Then follow me, I know a shortcut out of here.
You want a drink?
Is this the fast way you've mentioned?
We must eat well to go fast.
How can we travel far without eating?
They are the Bidomun, a branch of Heukdobang's gang.
I recognize the symbol.
I heard they are out of their minds because their boss was killed.
Let's go now.
We don't have much time.
I will decide whether to go or not.
If I don't like it, I won't go.
Who the hell are you?
My boss here told me to ask you something!
What?
That girl?
What did she say?
She wonders if it's true that your boss died from overdoing it with women.
That bitch!
Please just ignore him and let it go.
Too late.
We already heard him!
What are you doing?
We are still in mourning for my father.
That guy picked a fight with us.
We didn't have a choice.
I gave you an order to be cautious, no matter what happened!
Say again what you just said.
I found him!
Here!
Here!
It's very late.
Let's go now.
Uh...
OK...
Go quickly.
I appreciate your help very much.
Don't say that.
How can I just ignore this kind of thing?
I wish...
I wish I could cut him though for your sake...
Everything will be okay, don't worry.
Let's go.
What happened?
After listening to our story, she said she would help us.
Story?
You told her everything?
Are you out of your mind?
You have no idea how fast rumors spread in this town.
I said that you abandoned your wife and children to run away with a widow, stealing your ill mother's money.
Hey!
You're a warrior.
How can you lie to people like that?
Sword is not the only thing you need in the battle field.
Put these on.
It's going to be a tough walk and quite cold from now on.
That's okay.
I'm not going to care if you get cold later on.
Let's go.
How did you learn martial art?
I've only trained to use sword.
Where did you learn to use it?
I learned from a military camp.
I had learned from many soldiers since I was little.
You had one rough life.
I would've give up.
What is going on?
I need to get horses.
I don't think it is possible.
It is not like stealing clothes.
It is way too difficult to steal them.
We have to wait till dawn, and...
Don't worry, I can pay.
Damn, it's hot!
It's killing me...
Wow, who's this!
Brother Sosam!
- I brought you a customer.
- Customer?
Do you like any of them?
I want to buy the one on the far right and the fourth one.
You know your horses.
But they are quite expensive...
Since you came with Brother Sosam, I'll give you a good deal.
For the two, give me 300 jeon.
I live off of you, Brother.
But they're real good horses!
- But they're stolen.
- Shhh!
Come on...
She's fine.
Who is she?
A devil from hell.
Come to take me to die.
What?
Never understand a single word...
Anyway let me take a sword.
I'd better carry one since someone's trying to kill me...
Let's see.
This one should be good.
Why did you choose that one?
Take a better one.
I'll pick one for you.
Doesn't matter.
I'll never use it anyhow.
You surprised me...
You're here again.
No word from the Deputy Commander yet?
Please don't worry...
Maeyoungok has never lost her quarry.
Wouldn't it depend on who the quarry is?
- Have you found out?
- Of course!
Do you know a female warrior called Yeon Soha?
I'll go myself.
Are you going to kill the prince again this time?
The royal court wants Balhae's royal family to cooperate.
To help calm the conflicts and uprisings all around the country.
But because you've been killing every member of the royal family, the court can't trust you.
If you want to gain something big, you'd better control your vengeful spirit.
Understand?
Father!
Welcome!
How can I help you?
We don't need dinner.
Give us a place to stay.
Yes!
How many rooms...
Can't you see?
There are two people.
Then I'll prepare...
Give us one room.
One's enough.
Are you going to stay like that all night?
This is the way Biseonwon warriors guard the door of the king until he falls asleep.
Please do not worry.
If you're going to be silly, you'd better come in and be silly.
You're going to be the king.
There shouldn't be any kind of scandalous rumors.
Are we in Balhae?
Who's going to see?
Whoever's watching or not is not important.
Under the heavens, The king should have nothing to hide.
You speak as if I'm going to be the king.
When did I say I would?
I'm not going to.
He said they went to Hadong.
The Chief Commander is coming.
Hey, Officer Yeon Soha!
You said you grew up in the military.
Was your father a soldier?
No, Sir.
Then, why?
I didn't have anywhere else to go.
Georan soldiers killed my father when I was 9, my mother when I was 10...
I didn't have any other relatives.
It'll be tough to get to Hadong today.
There's a place to stay near there.
A very cozy place.
What's that?
That incense...
It's my habit to comfort the dead.
Those who I used to know and the enemies who have been killed by my sword.
You comfort even the souls of your enemies?
With no hatred or resentment?
At least you won't be eaten by an evil spirit.
Why?
I also learned how to use the sword in Balhae.
I know the story that evil spirits born from the resentment, spite, and hatred, that lives on in your sword.
Grown-ups used to scare me with the story that an evil spirit grows by drinking blood and finally makes the owner of the sword evil as well.
I learned when I grew up that the story meant one shouldn't lose serenity because of hatred.
I believe evil spirits grow in the sword.
Do you still believe what you were told when you were little?
That is why you treat it so carefully.
It protects you from evil spirits.
Yes.
I believe I have to use the sword to protect my important things.
Hey...
What would people think when they hold the sword?
Protecting?
No way...
Killing comes the first.
That is instinct.
I have tried to tell a couple of times, don't give me that look.
Don't give me that pity look.
I have had a fairly great life until I met you.
I need to meet someone.
Wait here for a while.
We don't have much time.
There's still a long way to go...
It's the owner of this shop.
Don't go anywhere, just wait here.
It'll only take me a moment.
Hey, who's this?
Here you go!
What are you doing here, without telling us you were coming?
I'd like to get back my money that you're keeping for me.
It looks like I'll have to go in hiding for a while.
What have you done?
It's a long story.
I'll tell you later.
So where are you going this time?
Well...
For now, quite far...
Sosam, to be honest, some people came by here yesterday.
Who?
They...
Said they were with the Killer-Blade Army.
And they're looking for you!
Let's talk.
Did you think you could get away from me?
Let me ask you one thing.
Would you like to cooperate with Dongranguk?
Negotiate?
I don't know what you mean by that...
You...
Why are you trying so hard to take me?
Because you're going to be Balhae's king.
You've seen how I live.
Do you think the throne fits me?
You'll be an excellent king.
Thank you for thinking highly of me, but let me tell you one thing.
I was going to leave you here and run away.
I failed because my friend betrayed me.
If you were really going to do that, there were a lot of chances.
Why do you think I'm telling you this?
I have no intention to go to Balhae.
If I hope to survive, there are many other ways.
You have to go no matter what.
Then tell me one good reason why I must go to Balhae.
Why do I have to go there?
As far as I know, you weren't present at your mother's deathbed.
We'll pass by Cheonaegok on the way.
There is a graveyard.
Your Highness!
Long time no see.
I know only one thing.
My father and family were dishonored and brutally killed by the royal family of Balhae.
The charges against them were not false.
I don't care who says what.
I will kill whoever insulted my father and family.
Your Highness, are you OK?
No, I'm not OK.
Do you know how terrible it is to be stabbed from behind?
A message came from headquarters.
What would you like to do?
Say we haven't found them.
I'm not going back before I kill Yeon Soha.
Kill Yeon Soha?
As long as I'm under orders, I want to take care of it on my own.
And...
I don't want to cause trouble to you, most of all.
I will give you four days.
If I see Yeon Soha, you'll have no more chances.
It was quite close.
I guess it may not be that serious...
It is from the street fight.
It is from the battle field.
What made you think...
I wouldn't even get close to it.
I was told you joined the majesty, your father, for the battle against Georan when you were only fifteen.
Georan soldiers!
They seem dropping out of the headquarters.
Your highness!
Look at this chaos.
They wouldn't have time to pack.
They wouldn't even dare to fight, but run.
What is that for?
It is for you since you are not well.
It seems so convenience.
Hand it over.
I will do, your highness.
Why?
Have you ever done carpenter's work?
I had to fix stuffs to sell.
Some dorks broke things when they stole goods.
What?
This is what I have been doing.
You see!
I'm not even close to be a King.
You made wrong decision.
General KeumHwee.
For the fifteen years old prince who was brave and fought in the battle field, every soldiers called you by that name.
With glint helmet, You were surely stand out in the battle field.
How well do you know about me?
There were many princes who fought in the field but no one could even get close to what you had done.
You are the one people rely on in this harsh time.
I'm nobody.
All that is left is useless myself, Sosam.
Your real nature wouldn't have changed.
That is wrong.
I have confidence in you.
Don't be silly.
What if you are wrong?
I bet my life on that.
Do we have to do that?
Going across the border is the fastest way to Balhae.
We could get into big trouble unless we put on Georan costumes.
Don't reveal your emotions.
They are looking for Balhae's militia corp soldiers.
Those who fought here were not from regular army of Balhae.
They were from militia corp.
They used to be normal farmers or wood gatherers.
Give me the reins now.
I'll take it from here.
That's okay.
I'm bored.
I'm bored to death.
Take a nap.
Or sing a song.
What is wrong with you?
You seem so upset.
With all your help, I try to help you back, but all I get is your angry look.
What is wrong with me, you asked?
Your highness, you were almost killed.
You should be a king.
Your life does not only belong to you, but to all people.
What you have done would have kill more people.
You shouldn't worry too much.
Reason why I'm heading that way is to visit my mother's graveyard.
We are almost there.
There should be a person from Balhae waiting for us.
What's wrong?
You don't look well.
I'm okay.
Let's rest for a moment.
We must go.
We can't slow down because of me.
Take it.
I may not be able to protect you, but I can avoid causing you more trouble.
Let's go, please.
You said the life of a king is not his own, and said that he should run away, even if the man who would protect him is dying.
Let's say I'm the king of Balhae.
You're telling me I should become a king who only thinks about himself, although his man is dying?
Is that a king?
If that is...
I will never become the king.
Please let me go.
You have to receive a bow in welcome.
I, Jocheonsu, under General lmsunji, greet Prince Jeonghyeon, Your Highness.
What happened to you?
- Uncle...
- Yes.
Please take care of the prince.
Soha!
Why is she sick?
Is it serious?
Tell me what's happened.
She's been poisoned by snake venom.
I think it's too late.
I heard that lmseonju moved to protect the prince.
With his army...
Do you understand what this means?
Once they arrive here, there'll be no chance!
I'll finish before they arrive.
The royal court wants something more specific.
They sent the Golden Boy Army here!
The Golden Bow Army will catch the prince.
The Killer-Blade Army can wait for a new mission.
But...
It's the orders of the court!
Are you going to go against them?
I called you because of Gunhwapyeong.
The Killer-Blade Army should have taken care of this job.
But the Golden Bow Army has been sent already...
If the Golden Bow Army takes the honor of victory, I cannot keep my promise with Gunhwapyeong.
Send us please.
We are sure to succeed!
I wish I could.
But I already have my orders.
Well, there may be a way...
Can you give me your life for it?
Of course!
Do you know what I mean?
I...
I am a warrior!
If there is any way for you to succeed, you must take it, don't you think?
Don't you regret?
About changing your country...
Why... don't you like it?
I don't care about country.
My only concern is to serve you.
Whatever your position is, you're always the same person to me.
It won't take long...
Once the last prince is killed the dream will come true...
I will establish my own country on the territory of current Balhae with a help of Georan.
Now she passed the crucial moment.
She will wake up soon.
Now you should go meet your mother.
Yayul cheolla said we have to leave before the Golden Bow Army arrives.
I will never forget what you wished for, Maeyoungok...
Have you contacted the Golden Bow Army?
Of course.
They might attack you Killer Blades unless they know you're coming.
Prince Jeonghyeon will be dead...
No matter who finds him, the Killer Blades or the Golden Bows.
What do you mean?
You're still thinking like that?
The court wants the prince alive...
You... think you'll be okay after this?
The Balhae people killed you.
Or, better yet, Prince Jeonghyeon.
So I killed Jeonghyeon to avenge you.
It's a simple story.
You...
Ingrate...
He is dead.
Send this message of his death to the Gloden Bow Army.
I think you should go.
She may be awake.
I should.
Your name is Jocheonsu, right?
Yes, your highness.
You look familiar.
I have seen you a couple of times in the battle field,
General Keumhwee.
How is the wound on your back?
Your Highness.
There is a person from headquarters.
Chief of assault team, Jochensu.
I came here to see you, your highness.
You are deeply wounded.
I will call medic to bring you to headquarters.
It wouldn't take long, your highness.
I remember you, now.
Chief of assault team, Jochensu.
Please take your time to see her.
I will.
Soha!
You're awake.
Good.
The prince is not here.
He went to Lady Oh's grave.
He was on guard for you all night.
Gunhwapyeong's here!
Is that how Gunhwapyeong indicates he's on the hunt?
The prince is in danger!
Mother, I'm here.
I survived no matter what as I promised to you.
Are you satisfied now?
Aren't you...
Jocheonsu, the one who used to be called the One-Strike-Killer?
It's been a long time, Gunhwapyeong.
I've heard enough about your brutal killings.
Take off.
I'll catch you up later.
Hurry!
Now that you've met me, I think you're killing days are over.
We must hurry.
Have you recovered?
Are you ok?
Yes, I'm fine.
Let's go.
Better than expected, Gunhwapyeong.
But you're just an old tiger now...
This...
This is...
To the victor goes the spoils...
Your Highness!
No more energy, already?
I know what's happening to you.
If you overuse your energy when you're poisoned, your blood gets all twisted.
If you practice your military techniques, you'll die.
You're wrong.
There's difference between not being able to use the techniques and not being allowed to use them.
You...
What's going on?
Stop right there, Commander Gunhwapyeong.
Jocheonsu is dead.
I killed him...
And now I'm going to kill that prince...
There's only one way.
There's one attack, but it will cost you your life.
Do you know what you need for that one blow?
You need the will to kill.
Think of how much you want to kill.
That's all.
The sword... it's not for killing.
It is for protecting valuable things.
But nobody can block my way...
Just sit there... and watch the prince die helplessly.
That... sword...
You know it well...
Your father gave the same sword to two young princes.
How...
How did you...
Because I killed Daesuhyeon.
Your Highness.
Teach me how to use the sword.
Why do you want to learn?
My father and mother, both were killed by the Georan people.
I...
I want to learn.
The sword is not for killing or hurting people.
Rather, it's for protecting something valuable.
Let me ask you one thing.
Why do you have it?
I saved it to kill you... the last in the lineage.
That's wrong...
That sword is not the secret sword you think it is.
But the sword you were lookin for is...
The true sword is the valuable spirit of Soha's.
I must save that spirit.
No matter what.
There's this thing called the Body-Attack technique.
Both Daesuhyeon and Jocheonsu...
I killed them with this skill.
With this skill...
I will also kill you.
Slowly.
With the secret skill of the Balhae royal family.
You know, this was the only military technique that I learned completely.
I guess you haven't learned how to overcome the inner shock.
From the beginning, you couldn't beat me.
Why...
Why didn't you tell me?
You must pass Cheonaegok now.
I'm asking you why...
You...
You really thought I'd be the king?
Since the day I met you in Junwon, I've never doubted.
Not even once...
Because you must be... the same person you were 14 years ago.
Without you...
I wouldn't be here.
You brought me a reason to live... to me who lost everything.
You were my life for 14 years.
It's General lmsunji and soldier of Balhae.
Please get ready to meet them.
Soha!
Soha!
I...
I have no chance.
What are you talking about?
Everything is over!
We're almost there!
Please don't say anything.
Please stay like this for a while.
I beg you...
Your Highness, I kept my promise.
But...
You didn't...
Save your life.
I saved something more valuable than my life.
Sword is to protect important things to you.
Am I right?
Soha...
Soha!
We were robbed our castles, our land and our country.
They even stole our capital and changed the name of the palace.
A lot of people have died.
They're telling us to recover the valuable things the things they lost.
So, in this battle, we are not going to falter or fail in!
If we have no strength and are caught, our eyes will pierce the enemies.
If our eyes get plucked out...
We'll speak about their sins to the heavens!
We'll let them know they can never take us from this land!
Now this castle will again be called Holhan Palace and we'll restore our country!
Charge!
In 928, Dongranguk withdrew to Leaotong area.
Post-Balhae and Jeongahnguk were founded on the territory.
Both of them proudly called themselves the descendants of Balhae.
The medics have arrived to escort you.
- Genera Jo.
- Please speak freely.
This kid lost both parents.
Please take care of her.
Yes, sir.
You remember everything I told you?
Yes.
Can you promise you won't forget?
Yes, I promise.
That's it!
The things we make have one supreme quality -- they live longer than us.
We perish, they survive; we have one life, they have many lives, and in each life they can mean different things.
Which means that, while we all have one biography, they have many.
I want this morning to talk about the story, the biography -- or rather the biographies -- of one particular object, one remarkable thing.
It doesn't, I agree, look very much.
It's about the size of a rugby ball.
It's made of clay, and it's been fashioned into a cylinder shape, covered with close writing and then baked dry in the sun.
And as you can see, it's been knocked about a bit, which is not surprising because it was made two and a half thousand years ago and was dug up in 1879.
But today, this thing is, I believe, a major player in the politics of the Middle East.
And it's an object with fascinating stories and stories that are by no means over yet.
The story begins in the Iran-Iraq war and that series of events that culminated in the invasion of Iraq by foreign forces, the removal of a despotic ruler and instant regime change.
And I want to begin with one episode from that sequence of events that most of you would be very familiar with, Belshazzar's feast -- because we're talking about the Iran-Iraq war of 539 BC.
And the parallels between the events of 539 BC and 2003 and in between are startling.
What you're looking at is Rembrandt's painting, now in the National Gallery in London, illustrating the text from the prophet Daniel in the Hebrew scriptures.
And you all know roughly the story.
Belshazzar, the son of Nebuchadnezzar, Nebuchadnezzar who'd conquered Israel, sacked Jerusalem and captured the people and taken the Jews back to Babylon.
Not only the Jews, he'd taken the temple vessels.
He'd ransacked, desecrated the temple.
And the great gold vessels of the temple in Jerusalem had been taken to Babylon.
Belshazzar, his son, decides to have a feast.
And in order to make it even more exciting, he added a bit of sacrilege to the rest of the fun, and he brings out the temple vessels.
He's already at war with the Iranians, with the king of Persia.
And that night, Daniel tells us, at the height of the festivities a hand appeared and wrote on the wall,
"You are weighed in the balance and found wanting, and your kingdom is handed over to the Medes and the Persians."
And that very night Cyrus, king of the Persians, entered Babylon and the whole regime of Belshazzar fell.
It is, of course, a great moment in the history of the Jewish people.
It's a great story.
It's story we all know.
"The writing on the wall" is part of our everyday language.
What happened next was remarkable, and it's where our cylinder enters the story.
Cyrus, king of the Persians, has entered Babylon without a fight -- the great empire of Babylon, which ran from central southern Iraq to the Mediterranean, falls to Cyrus.
And Cyrus makes a declaration. And that is what this cylinder is, the declaration made by the ruler guided by God who had toppled the Iraqi despot and was going to bring freedom to the people.
In ringing Babylonian -- it was written in Babylonian -- he says, "I am Cyrus, king of all the universe, the great king, the powerful king, king of Babylon, king of the four quarters of the world."
They're not shy of hyperbole as you can see.
This is probably the first real press release by a victorious army that we've got.
And it's written, as we'll see in due course, by very skilled P.R. consultants.
So the hyperbole is not actually surprising.
And what is the great king, the powerful king, the king of the four quarters of the world going to do?
He goes on to say that, having conquered Babylon, he will at once let all the peoples that the Babylonians -- Nebuchadnezzar and Belshazzar -- have captured and enslaved go free.
He'll let them return to their countries.
And more important, he will let them all recover the gods, the statues, the temple vessels that had been confiscated.
All the peoples that the Babylonians had repressed and removed will go home, and they'll take with them their gods.
And they'll be able to restore their altars and to worship their gods in their own way, in their own place.
This is the decree, this object is the evidence for the fact that the Jews, after the exile in Babylon, the years they'd spent sitting by the waters of Babylon, weeping when they remembered Jerusalem, those Jews were allowed to go home.
They were allowed to return to Jerusalem and to rebuild the temple.
It's a central document in Jewish history.
And the Book of Chronicles, the Book of Ezra in the Hebrew scriptures reported in ringing terms.
This is the Jewish version of the same story.
"Thus said Cyrus, king of Persia,
'All the kingdoms of the earth have the Lord God of heaven given thee, and he has charged me to build him a house in Jerusalem.
Who is there among you of his people?
The Lord God be with him, and let him go up.'"
"Go up" -- aaleh.
The central element, still, of the notion of return, a central part of the life of Judaism.
As you all know, that return from exile, the second temple, reshaped Judaism.
And that change, that great historic moment, was made possible by Cyrus, the king of Persia, reported for us in Hebrew in scripture and in Babylonian in clay.
Two great texts, what about the politics?
What was going on was the fundamental shift in Middle Eastern history.
The empire of Iran, the Medes and the Persians, united under Cyrus, became the first great world empire.
Cyrus begins in the 530s BC.
And by the time of his son Darius, the whole of the eastern Mediterranean is under Persian control.
This empire is, in fact, the Middle East as we now know it, and it's what shapes the Middle East as we now know it.
It was the largest empire the world had known until then.
Much more important, it was the first multicultural, multifaith state on a huge scale.
And it had to be run in a quite new way.
It had to be run in different languages.
The fact that this decree is in Babylonian says one thing.
And it had to recognize their different habits, different peoples, different religions, different faiths.
All of those are respected by Cyrus.
Cyrus sets up a model of how you run a great multinational, multifaith, multicultural society.
And the result of that was an empire that included the areas you see on the screen, and which survived for 200 years of stability until it was shattered by Alexander.
It left a dream of the Middle East as a unit, and a unit where people of different faiths could live together.
The Greek invasions ended that.
And of course, Alexander couldn't sustain a government and it fragmented.
But what Cyrus represented remained absolutely central.
The Greek historian Xenophon wrote his book "Cyropaedia" promoting Cyrus as the great ruler.
And throughout European culture afterward, Cyrus remained the model.
This is a 16th century image to show you how widespread his veneration actually was.
And Xenophon's book on Cyrus on how you ran a diverse society was one of the great textbooks that inspired the Founding Fathers of the American Revolution.
Jefferson was a great admirer -- the ideals of Cyrus obviously speaking to those 18th century ideals of how you create religious tolerance in a new state.
Meanwhile, back in Babylon, things had not been going well.
After Alexander, the other empires, Babylon declines, falls into ruins, and all the traces of the great Babylonian empire are lost -- until 1879 when the cylinder is discovered by a British Museum exhibition digging in Babylon.
And it enters now another story.
It enters that great debate in the middle of the 19th century:
Are the scriptures reliable?
Can we trust them?
We only knew about the return of the Jews and the decree of Cyrus from the Hebrew scriptures.
No other evidence.
Suddenly, this appeared.
And great excitement to a world where those who believed in the scriptures had had their faith in creation shaken by evolution, by geology, here was evidence that the scriptures were historically true.
It's a great 19th century moment.
But -- and this, of course, is where it becomes complicated -- the facts were true, hurrah for archeology, but the interpretation was rather more complicated.
Because the cylinder account and the Hebrew Bible account differ in one key respect.
The Babylonian cylinder is written by the priests of the great god of Bablyon, Marduk.
And, not surprisingly, they tell you that all this was done by Marduk.
"Marduk, we hold, called Cyrus by his name."
Marduk takes Cyrus by the hand, calls him to shepherd his people and gives him the rule of Babylon.
Marduk tells Cyrus that he will do these great, generous things of setting the people free.
And this is why we should all be grateful to and worship Marduk.
The Hebrew writers in the Old Testament, you will not be surprised to learn, take a rather different view of this.
For them, of course, it can't possibly by Marduk that made all this happen.
It can only be Jehovah.
And so in Isaiah, we have the wonderful texts giving all the credit of this, not to Marduk but to the Lord God of Israel -- the Lord God of Israel who also called Cyrus by name, also takes Cyrus by the hand and talks of him shepherding his people.
It's a remarkable example of two different priestly appropriations of the same event, two different religious takeovers of a political fact.
God, we know, is usually on the side of the big battalions.
The question is, which god was it?
And the debate unsettles everybody in the 19th century to realize that the Hebrew scriptures are part of a much wider world of religion.
And it's quite clear the cylinder is older than the text of Isaiah, and yet, Jehovah is speaking in words very similar to those used by Marduk.
And there's a slight sense that Isaiah knows this, because he says, this is God speaking, of course,
"I have called thee by thy name though thou hast not known me."
I think it's recognized that Cyrus doesn't realize that he's acting under orders from Jehovah.
And equally, he'd have been surprised that he was acting under orders from Marduk.
Because interestingly, of course, Cyrus is a good Iranian with a totally different set of gods who are not mentioned in any of these texts.
(Laughter)
That's 1879.
40 years on and we're in 1917, and the cylinder enters a different world.
This time, the real politics of the contemporary world -- the year of the Balfour Declaration, the year when the new imperial power in the Middle East, Britain, decides that it will declare a Jewish national home, it will allow the Jews to return.
And the response to this by the Jewish population in Eastern Europe is rhapsodic.
And across Eastern Europe, Jews display pictures of Cyrus and of George V side by side -- the two great rulers who have allowed the return to Jerusalem.
And the Cyrus cylinder comes back into public view and the text of this as a demonstration of why what is going to happen after the war is over in 1918 is part of a divine plan.
You all know what happened.
The state of Israel is setup, and 50 years later, in the late 60s, it's clear that Britain's role as the imperial power is over.
And another story of the cylinder begins.
The region, the U.K. and the U.S. decide, has to be kept safe from communism, and the superpower that will be created to do this would be Iran, the Shah.
And so the Shah invents an Iranian history, or a return to Iranian history, that puts him in the center of a great tradition and produces coins showing himself with the Cyrus cylinder.
When he has his great celebrations in Persepolis, he summons the cylinder and the cylinder is lent by the British Museum, goes to Tehran, and is part of those great celebrations of the Pahlavi dynasty.
Cyrus cylinder: guarantor of the Shah.
10 years later, another story:
Iranian Revolution, 1979.
Islamic revolution, no more Cyrus; we're not interested in that history, we're interested in Islamic Iran -- until Iraq, the new superpower that we've all decided should be in the region, attacks.
Then another Iran-Iraq war.
And it becomes critical for the Iranians to remember their great past, their great past when they fought Iraq and won.
It becomes critical to find a symbol that will pull together all Iranians --
Muslims and non-Muslims,
Christians, Zoroastrians, Jews living in Iran, people who are devout, not devout.
And the obvious emblem is Cyrus.
So when the British Museum and Tehran National Musuem cooperate and work together, as we've been doing, the Iranians ask for one thing only as a loan.
It's the only object they want.
They want to borrow the Cyrus cylinder.
And last year, the Cyrus cylinder went to Tehran for the second time.
It's shown being presented here, put into its case by the director of the National Museum of Tehran, one of the many women in Iran in very senior positions,
Mrs. Ardakani.
It was a huge event.
This is the other side of that same picture.
It's seen in Tehran by between one and two million people in the space of a few months.
This is beyond any blockbuster exhibition in the West.
And it's the subject of a huge debate about what this cylinder means, what Cyrus means, but above all, Cyrus as articulated through this cylinder -- Cyrus as the defender of the homeland, the champion, of course, of Iranian identity and of the Iranian peoples, tolerant of all faiths.
And in the current Iran, Zoroastrians and Christians have guaranteed places in the Iranian parliament, something to be very, very proud of.
To see this object in Tehran, thousands of Jews living in Iran came to Tehran to see it.
It became a great emblem, a great subject of debate about what Iran is at home and abroad.
Is Iran still to be the defender of the oppressed?
Will Iran set free the people that the tyrants have enslaved and expropriated?
This is heady national rhetoric, and it was all put together in a great pageant launching the return.
Here you see this out-sized Cyrus cylinder on the stage with great figures from Iranian history gathering to take their place in the heritage of Iran.
It was a narrative presented by the president himself.
And for me, to take this object to Iran, to be allowed to take this object to Iran was to be allowed to be part of an extraordinary debate led at the highest levels about what Iran is, what different Irans there are and how the different histories of Iran might shape the world today.
It's a debate that's still continuing, and it will continue to rumble, because this object is one of the great declarations of a human aspiration.
It stands with the American constitution.
It certainly says far more about real freedoms than Magna Carta.
It is a document that can mean so many things, for Iran and for the region.
A replica of this is at the United Nations.
In New York this autumn, it will be present when the great debates about the future of the Middle East take place.
And I want to finish by asking you what the next story will be in which this object figures.
It will appear, certainly, in many more Middle Eastern stories.
And what story of the Middle East, what story of the world, do you want to see reflecting what is said, what is expressed in this cylinder?
The right of peoples to live together in the same state, worshiping differently, freely -- a Middle East, a world, in which religion is not the subject of division or of debate.
In the world of the Middle East at the moment, the debates are, as you know, shrill.
But I think it's possible that the most powerful and the wisest voice of all of them may well be the voice of this mute thing, the Cyrus cylinder.
Thank you.
(Applause)
And...action.
When having friends over for lunch, show them that you really care, by incorporating some fresh flowers in your table scape.
I like to use something unconventional for a vase.
Like this old blender.
Isn't that unique?
And what a great conversation starter.
Think of what everyone will be saying about blenders and vases.
Voila!
Up next,
A few helpful hints on one of my favorite topics
Braising.
I'm Honey Garret and you're watching "A Little Bit of Honey".
And we're out!
Excuse me. Ms. Garret.
Who are you?
I'm Nelson Dorkoff.
I hired you to cater my birthday party the other night.
Oh, right.
Well, I'm surprise you remember.
I haven't seen the guest of honor swill that much booze since I catered Liza Minelli's wedding to that gay troll.
I'm sorry to interrupt.
What are you doing, by the way?
Oh, we're doing a demo for the Food Network.
Oh my God.
Do you need a charismatic sidekick with tons of acting experience?
I carry these with me everywhere.
I see that you do.
But sorry, its a cooking show, not "The Biggest Loser".
Listen, Honey...
Don't get that familiar with me.
I don't know you.
I was just calling you by your name.
Oh, right.
Before you go back to taping,
I just wanted to ask you a few questions about night of the party.
Your food was delicious by the way.
Oh, what a doll!
Now, I don't need a sidekick.
But I would like people to stop by Honey's Kitchen.
Phil, roll...
Phil, get off the phone!
And role the camera!
Center yourself Honey.
And...action!
I'm back, and just like the Barefoot Contessa,
I like to have my gay queenie friends stop by the show as well.
And today I have Nelson.
And Nelson, I recently catered your 50th Birthday party.
40th Birthday.
If any casting directors are watching.
However, my age range is 30 to 50.
Apparently, my shrimp puffs were a huge hit.
Actually they were very few leftovers of anything, right?
I thought I went overboard preparing you know food for 100, but then these 20 very large men came by the party and really cleaned me out.
Now, Nelson, do you have any questions about my food?
Actually I do.
Where you around the food the entire night?
Oh, well course I was. I prepared it.
Well, did you notice anybody suspicious around the food?
Could they have put something in it?
Gee, Nelson, I don't know what you are getting at.
I use only the freshest ingredients.
Listen, Honey.
I'm not friend, don't call me that.
I'm just calling her by name.
Miss Garrett.
Someone was murdered at our party.
And the police believe they were Poisoned.
By my food?!
Maybe.
Oh my God!!
Phil!
Cut it off!
Cut the Goddamn camera off.
Get Out here!
Get over here!
Are you trying to ruin me?!
Huh?
Did Rachel Ray send you?
Huh?
Did she send you?
Because I happen to know that she's very threatened by me.
She will do anything in her power to make sure that my demo does not reach the executives at the Food Network!
That gravelly voiced bitch!
30 Minute Meal, my ass!
30 minutes, then got shit on your plate!
Then you got to eat it!
Calm down, Honey.
Don't patronize me!
I am NOT your honey....
Oh my God!
Did you just change your name to Honey?
Actually I did.
I needed something catchier than "A Little Bit O Agnes."
Look, I'm not accusing you of anything. OK?
But I have to know.
Do you recognize this guy?
Because he was poisoned at our party that YOU catered.
I've never seen him before in my life.
And I certainly didn't poison him.
And, I did not hire any waiters.
I served everything myself.
So it could not be my food.
The only person I hired was the bartender.
What's his name?
Todd Stevens.
Hot Toddy?
Oh, ya ya.
He was hot!
And he was the only straight guy there.
He was flirting with me ALL night.
Okay, that's impossible.
Because he's gay, and he's sleeping with me.
Oh, sweetie, oh my oh... you ARE an actor.
What a crock!
He is!
And, I'm nuts about him...
OK, crazy!
Well, you just live in that fantasy land that you got up there in that noodle.
And, if you're through accusing me of murder.
Then I'd like to get back to my demo.
You Crazy Mother Fucker!!
Jesus Phil, roll camera.
We're losing light.
He was bar tending that night?
Terrific.
Reggie and Wood are going to have a field day with this.
[Mooji:] So this 'I' itself; in front of it, every... not only physical things - not only the five elemental combination in it's innumerable aspects - not only that but subtle things like feelings and thoughts, space, time; all of these things are appearing for the same one; the one who perceives, who ultimately sees everything.
Where is its location, this ultimate seer?
Where is its location?
Where is its address?
All you can say, is somehow, it's myself.
Myself, in this body, feels somewhere here.
I can't say actually it's here two digits from the solar plexus.
No, not even that.
And it's not my third eye, or the other two eyes.
It's not... no.
But just the sense that it's here, it's in me; it's taking place in me.
I'm the seer of all of this.
The most subtle things seem to have to report to something here.
I'm the one who sees it.
All of life, it's right here.
CHAPTER ill.
Gregor's serious wound, from which he suffered for over a month--since no one ventured to remove the apple, it remained in his flesh as a visible reminder--seemed by itself to have reminded the father that, in spite of his present unhappy and hateful appearance, Gregor was a member of the family, something one should not treat as an enemy, and that it was, on the contrary, a requirement of family duty to suppress one's aversion and to endure--nothing else, just endure.
And if through his wound Gregor had now apparently lost for good his ability to move and for the time being needed many, many minutes to crawl across his room, like an aged invalid--so far as creeping up high was concerned, that was unimaginable-- nevertheless for this worsening of his condition, in his opinion, he did get completely satisfactory compensation, because every day towards evening the door to the living room, which he was in the habit of keeping a sharp eye on even one or two hours beforehand, was opened, so that he, lying down in the darkness of his room, invisible from the living room, could see the entire family at the illuminated table and listen to their conversation, to a certain extent with their common permission, a situation quite different from what had happened before.
Of course, it was no longer the animated social interaction of former times, which
Gregor in small hotel rooms had always thought about with a certain longing, when, tired out, he had had to throw himself into the damp bedclothes.
For the most part what went on now was very quiet.
After the evening meal, the father fell asleep quickly in his arm chair.
The mother and sister talked guardedly to each other in the stillness.
Bent far over, the mother sewed fine undergarments for a fashion shop.
The sister, who had taken on a job as a salesgirl, in the evening studied stenography and French, so as perhaps later to obtain a better position.
Sometimes the father woke up and, as if he was quite ignorant that he had been asleep, said to the mother "How long you have been sewing today?" and went right back to sleep, while the mother and the sister smiled tiredly to each other.
With a sort of stubbornness the father refused to take off his servant's uniform even at home, and while his sleeping gown hung unused on the coat hook, the father dozed completely dressed in his place, as if he was always ready for his responsibility and even here was waiting for the voice of his superior.
As a result, in spite of all the care of the mother and sister, his uniform, which even at the start was not new, grew dirty, and Gregor looked, often for the entire evening, at this clothing, with stains all over it and with its gold buttons always polished, in which the old man, although very uncomfortable, slept peacefully nonetheless.
As soon as the clock struck ten, the mother tried gently encouraging the father to wake up and then persuading him to go to bed, on the ground that he couldn't get a proper sleep here and that the father, who had to report for service at six o'clock, really needed a good sleep.
But in his stubbornness, which had gripped him since he had become a servant, he insisted always on staying even longer by the table, although he regularly fell asleep and then could only be prevailed upon with the greatest difficulty to trade his chair for the bed.
No matter how much the mother and sister might at that point work on him with small admonitions, for a quarter of an hour he would remain shaking his head slowly, his eyes closed, without standing up.
The mother would pull him by the sleeve and speak flattering words into his ear; the sister would leave her work to help her mother, but that would not have the desired effect on the father.
He would settle himself even more deeply in his arm chair.
Only when the two women grabbed him under the armpits would he throw his eyes open, look back and forth at the mother and sister, and habitually say "This is a life.
This is the peace and quiet of my old age."
And propped up by both women, he would heave himself up elaborately, as if for him it was the greatest trouble, allow himself to be led to the door by the women, wave them away there, and proceed on his own from there, while the mother quickly threw down her sewing implements and the sister her pen in order to run after the father and help him some more.
In this overworked and exhausted family who had time to worry any longer about Gregor more than was absolutely necessary?
The household was constantly getting smaller.
The servant girl was now let go.
A huge bony cleaning woman with white hair flying all over her head came in the morning and evening to do the heaviest work.
The mother took care of everything else in addition to her considerable sewing work.
It even happened that various pieces of family jewellery, which previously the mother and sister had been overjoyed to wear on social and festive occasions, were sold, as Gregor found out in the evening from the general discussion of the prices they had fetched.
But the greatest complaint was always that they could not leave this apartment, which was too big for their present means, since it was impossible to imagine how Gregor might be moved.
But Gregor fully recognized that it was not just consideration for him which was preventing a move, for he could have been transported easily in a suitable box with a few air holes.
The main thing holding the family back from a change in living quarters was far more their complete hopelessness and the idea that they had been struck by a misfortune like no one else in their entire circle of relatives and acquaintances.
What the world demands of poor people they now carried out to an extreme degree.
The father bought breakfast to the petty officials at the bank, the mother sacrificed herself for the undergarments of strangers, the sister behind her desk was at the beck and call of customers, but the family's energies did not extend any further.
And the wound in his back began to pain Gregor all over again, when now mother and sister, after they had escorted the father to bed, came back, let their work lie, moved close together, and sat cheek to cheek and when his mother would now say, pointing to Gregor's room, "Close the door,
Grete," and when Gregor was again in the darkness, while close by the women mingled their tears or, quite dry eyed, stared at the table.
Gregor spent his nights and days with hardly any sleep.
Sometimes he thought that the next time the door opened he would take over the family arrangements just as he had earlier.
In his imagination appeared again, after a long time, his employer and supervisor and the apprentices, the excessively spineless custodian, two or three friends from other businesses, a chambermaid from a hotel in the provinces, a loving fleeting memory, a female cashier from a hat shop, whom he had seriously but too slowly courted--they all appeared mixed in with strangers or people he had already forgotten, but instead of helping him and his family, they were all unapproachable, and he was happy to see them disappear.
But then he was in no mood to worry about his family.
He was filled with sheer anger over the wretched care he was getting, even though he couldn't imagine anything which he might have an appetite for.
Still, he made plans about how he could take from the larder what he at all account deserved, even if he wasn't hungry.
Without thinking any more about how they might be able to give Gregor special pleasure, the sister now kicked some food or other very quickly into his room in the morning and at noon, before she ran off to her shop, and in the evening, quite indifferent to whether the food had perhaps only been tasted or, what happened most frequently, remained entirely undisturbed, she whisked it out with one sweep of her broom.
The task of cleaning his room, which she now always carried out in the evening, could not be done any more quickly.
Streaks of dirt ran along the walls; here and there lay tangles of dust and garbage.
At first, when his sister arrived, Gregor positioned himself in a particularly filthy corner in order with this posture to make something of a protest.
But he could have well stayed there for weeks without his sister's changing her ways.
In fact, she perceived the dirt as much as he did, but she had decided just to let it stay.
In this business, with a touchiness which was quite new to her and which had generally taken over the entire family, she kept watch to see that the cleaning of
Gregor's room remained reserved for her.
Once his mother had undertaken a major cleaning of Gregor's room, which she had only completed successfully after using a few buckets of water.
But the extensive dampness made Gregor sick and he lay supine, embittered and immobile on the couch.
However, the mother's punishment was not delayed for long.
For in the evening the sister had hardly observed the change in Gregor's room before she ran into the living room mightily offended and, in spite of her mother's hand
lifted high in entreaty, broke out in a fit of crying.
Her parents--the father had, of course, woken up with a start in his arm chair--at first looked at her astonished and helpless, until they started to get agitated.
Turning to his right, the father heaped reproaches on the mother that she was not to take over the cleaning of Gregor's room from the sister and, turning to his left, he shouted at the sister that she would no longer be allowed to clean Gregor's room ever again, while the mother tried to pull the father, beside himself in his excitement, into the bed room.
The sister, shaken by her crying fit, pounded on the table with her tiny fists, and Gregor hissed at all this, angry that no one thought about shutting the door and sparing him the sight of this commotion.
But even when the sister, exhausted from her daily work, had grown tired of caring for Gregor as she had before, even then the mother did not have to come at all on her behalf.
And Gregor did not have to be neglected.
For now the cleaning woman was there.
This old widow, who in her long life must have managed to survive the worst with the help of her bony frame, had no real horror of Gregor.
Without being in the least curious, she had once by chance opened Gregor's door.
At the sight of Gregor, who, totally surprised, began to scamper here and there, although no one was chasing him, she remained standing with her hands folded across her stomach staring at him.
Since then she did not fail to open the door furtively a little every morning and evening to look in on Gregor.
At first, she also called him to her with words which she presumably thought were friendly, like "Come here for a bit, old dung beetle!" or "Hey, look at the old dung beetle!"
Addressed in such a manner, Gregor answered nothing, but remained motionless in his place, as if the door had not been opened at all.
If only, instead of allowing this cleaning woman to disturb him uselessly whenever she felt like it, they had given her orders to clean up his room every day!
One day in the early morning--a hard downpour, perhaps already a sign of the coming spring, struck the window panes-- when the cleaning woman started up once again with her usual conversation, Gregor was so bitter that he turned towards her, as if for an attack, although slowly and weakly.
But instead of being afraid of him, the cleaning woman merely lifted up a chair standing close by the door and, as she stood there with her mouth wide open, her intention was clear: she would close her mouth only when the chair in her hand had been thrown down on Gregor's back.
"This goes no further, all right?" she asked, as Gregor turned himself around again, and she placed the chair calmly back in the corner.
Gregor ate hardly anything any more.
Only when he chanced to move past the food which had been prepared did he, as a game, take a bit into his mouth, hold it there for hours, and generally spit it out again.
At first he thought it might be his sadness over the condition of his room which kept him from eating, but he very soon became reconciled to the alterations in his room.
People had grown accustomed to put into storage in his room things which they couldn't put anywhere else, and at this point there were many such things, now that they had rented one room of the apartment to three lodgers.
These solemn gentlemen--all three had full beards, as Gregor once found out through a crack in the door--were meticulously intent on tidiness, not only in their own room but, since they had now rented a room here, in the entire household, and particularly in the kitchen.
They simply did not tolerate any useless or shoddy stuff.
Moreover, for the most part they had brought with them their own pieces of furniture.
Thus, many items had become superfluous, and these were not really things one could sell or things people wanted to throw out.
All these items ended up in Gregor's room, even the box of ashes and the garbage pail from the kitchen.
The cleaning woman, always in a hurry, simply flung anything that was momentarily useless into Gregor's room.
Fortunately Gregor generally saw only the relevant object and the hand which held it.
The cleaning woman perhaps was intending, when time and opportunity allowed, to take the stuff out again or to throw everything out all at once, but in fact the things remained lying there, wherever they had ended up at the first throw, unless Gregor squirmed his way through the accumulation of junk and moved it.
At first he was forced to do this because otherwise there was no room for him to creep around, but later he did it with a growing pleasure, although after such movements, tired to death and feeling wretched, he didn't budge for hours.
Because the lodgers sometimes also took their evening meal at home in the common living room, the door to the living room stayed shut on many evenings.
But Gregor had no trouble at all going without the open door.
Already on many evenings when it was open he had not availed himself of it, but, without the family noticing, was stretched out in the darkest corner of his room.
However, once the cleaning woman had left the door to the living room slightly ajar, and it remained open even when the lodgers came in in the evening and the lights were put on.
They sat down at the head of the table, where in earlier days the mother, the father, and Gregor had eaten, unfolded their serviettes, and picked up their knives and forks.
The mother immediately appeared in the door with a dish of meat and right behind her the sister with a dish piled high with potatoes.
The food gave off a lot of steam.
The gentlemen lodgers bent over the plate set before them, as if they wanted to check it before eating, and in fact the one who sat in the middle--for the other two he seemed to serve as the authority--cut off a piece of meat still on the plate obviously to establish whether it was sufficiently tender and whether or not something should be shipped back to the kitchen.
He was satisfied, and mother and sister, who had looked on in suspense, began to breathe easily and to smile.
The family itself ate in the kitchen.
In spite of that, before the father went into the kitchen, he came into the room and with a single bow, cap in hand, made a tour of the table.
The lodgers rose up collectively and murmured something in their beards.
Then, when they were alone, they ate almost in complete silence.
It seemed odd to Gregor that, out of all the many different sorts of sounds of eating, what was always audible was their chewing teeth, as if by that Gregor should be shown that people needed their teeth to eat and that nothing could be done even with the most handsome toothless jawbone.
"I really do have an appetite," Gregor said to himself sorrowfully, "but not for these things.
How these lodgers stuff themselves, and I am dying."
On this very evening the violin sounded from the kitchen.
Gregor didn't remember hearing it all through this period.
The lodgers had already ended their night meal, the middle one had pulled out a newspaper and had given each of the other two a page, and they were now leaning back, reading and smoking.
When the violin started playing, they became attentive, got up, and went on tiptoe to the hall door, at which they remained standing pressed up against one another.
They must have been audible from the kitchen, because the father called out
"Perhaps the gentlemen don't like the playing?
It can be stopped at once."
"On the contrary," stated the lodger in the middle, "might the young woman not come into us and play in the room here, where it is really much more comfortable and cheerful?"
"Oh, thank you," cried out the father, as if he were the one playing the violin.
The men stepped back into the room and waited.
Soon the father came with the music stand, the mother with the sheet music, and the sister with the violin.
The sister calmly prepared everything for the recital.
The parents, who had never previously rented a room and therefore exaggerated their politeness to the lodgers, dared not sit on their own chairs.
The father leaned against the door, his right hand stuck between two buttons of his buttoned-up uniform.
The mother, however, accepted a chair offered by one lodger.
Since she left the chair sit where the gentleman had chanced to put it, she sat to one side in a corner.
The sister began to play.
The father and mother, one on each side, followed attentively the movements of her hands.
Attracted by the playing, Gregor had ventured to advance a little further forward and his head was already in the living room.
He scarcely wondered about the fact that recently he had had so little consideration for the others.
Earlier this consideration had been something he was proud of.
And for that very reason he would have had at this moment more reason to hide away, because as a result of the dust which lay all over his room and flew around with the slightest movement, he was totally covered in dirt.
On his back and his sides he carted around with him dust, threads, hair, and remnants of food.
His indifference to everything was much too great for him to lie on his back and scour himself on the carpet, as he often had done earlier during the day.
In spite of his condition he had no timidity about inching forward a bit on the spotless floor of the living room.
In any case, no one paid him any attention.
The family was all caught up in the violin playing.
The lodgers, by contrast, who for the moment had placed themselves, hands in their trouser pockets, behind the music stand much too close to the sister, so that they could all see the sheet music, something that must certainly bother the sister, soon drew back to the window conversing in low voices with bowed heads, where they then remained, worriedly observed by the father.
It now seemed really clear that, having assumed they were to hear a beautiful or entertaining violin recital, they were disappointed and were allowing their peace and quiet to be disturbed only out of politeness.
The way in which they all blew the smoke from their cigars out of their noses and mouths in particular led one to conclude that they were very irritated.
And yet his sister was playing so beautifully.
Her face was turned to the side, her gaze followed the score intently and sadly.
Gregor crept forward still a little further, keeping his head close against the floor in order to be able to catch her gaze if possible.
Was he an animal that music so captivated him?
For him it was as if the way to the unknown nourishment he craved was revealing itself.
He was determined to press forward right to his sister, to tug at her dress, and to indicate to her in this way that she might still come with her violin into his room, because here no one valued the recital as he wanted to value it.
He did not wish to let her go from his room any more, at least not as long as he lived.
His frightening appearance would for the first time become useful for him.
He wanted to be at all the doors of his room simultaneously and snarl back at the attackers.
However, his sister should not be compelled but would remain with him voluntarily.
She would sit next to him on the sofa, bend down her ear to him, and he would then confide in her that he firmly intended to send her to the conservatory and that, if his misfortune had not arrived in the interim, he would have declared all this last Christmas--had Christmas really already come and gone?--and would have brooked no argument.
After this explanation his sister would break out in tears of emotion, and Gregor would lift himself up to her armpit and kiss her throat, which she, from the time she started going to work, had left exposed without a band or a collar.
"Mr. Samsa," called out the middle lodger to the father and, without uttering a further word, pointed his index finger at Gregor as he was moving slowly forward.
The violin fell silent.
The middle lodger smiled, first shaking his head once at his friends, and then looked down at Gregor once more.
Rather than driving Gregor back again, the father seemed to consider it of prime importance to calm down the lodgers, although they were not at all upset and
Gregor seemed to entertain them more than the violin recital.
The father hurried over to them and with outstretched arms tried to push them into their own room and simultaneously to block their view of Gregor with his own body.
At this point they became really somewhat irritated, although one no longer knew whether that was because of the father's behaviour or because of knowledge they had just acquired that they had, without knowing it, a neighbour like Gregor.
They demanded explanations from his father, raised their arms to make their points, tugged agitatedly at their beards, and moved back towards their room quite slowly.
In the meantime, the isolation which had suddenly fallen upon his sister after the sudden breaking off of the recital had overwhelmed her.
She had held onto the violin and bow in her limp hands for a little while and had continued to look at the sheet music as if she was still playing.
All at once she pulled herself together, placed the instrument in her mother's lap-- the mother was still sitting in her chair having trouble breathing for her lungs were labouring--and had run into the next room, which the lodgers, pressured by the father, were already approaching more rapidly.
One could observe how under the sister's practiced hands the sheets and pillows on the beds were thrown on high and arranged.
Even before the lodgers had reached the room, she was finished fixing the beds and was slipping out.
The father seemed so gripped once again with his stubbornness that he forgot about the respect which he always owed to his renters.
He pressed on and on, until at the door of the room the middle gentleman stamped loudly with his foot and thus brought the father to a standstill.
"I hereby declare," the middle lodger said, raising his hand and casting his glance both on the mother and the sister, "that considering the disgraceful conditions prevailing in this apartment and family"-- with this he spat decisively on the floor-- "I immediately cancel my room.
I will, of course, pay nothing at all for the days which I have lived here; on the contrary I shall think about whether or not I will initiate some sort of action against you, something which--believe me--will be very easy to establish."
He fell silent and looked directly in front of him, as if he was waiting for something.
In fact, his two friends immediately joined in with their opinions, "We also give immediate notice."
At that he seized the door handle, banged the door shut, and locked it.
The father groped his way tottering to his chair and let himself fall in it.
It looked as if he was stretching out for his usual evening snooze, but the heavy nodding of his head, which looked as if it was without support, showed that he was not sleeping at all.
Gregor had lain motionless the entire time in the spot where the lodgers had caught him.
Disappointment with the collapse of his plan and perhaps also weakness brought on by his severe hunger made it impossible for him to move.
He was certainly afraid that a general disaster would break over him at any moment, and he waited.
He was not even startled when the violin fell from the mother's lap, out from under her trembling fingers, and gave off a reverberating tone.
"My dear parents," said the sister banging her hand on the table by way of an introduction, "things cannot go on any longer in this way.
Maybe if you don't understand that, well, I do.
I will not utter my brother's name in front of this monster, and thus I say only that we must try to get rid of it.
We have tried what is humanly possible to take care of it and to be patient.
I believe that no one can criticize us in the slightest."
"She is right in a thousand ways," said the father to himself.
The mother, who was still incapable of breathing properly, began to cough numbly with her hand held up over her mouth and a manic expression in her eyes.
The sister hurried over to her mother and held her forehead.
The sister's words seemed to have led the father to certain reflections.
He sat upright, played with his uniform hat among the plates, which still lay on the table from the lodgers' evening meal, and looked now and then at the motionless
Gregor.
"We must try to get rid of it," the sister now said decisively to the father, for the mother, in her coughing fit, was not listening to anything.
"It is killing you both.
I see it coming.
When people have to work as hard as we all do, they cannot also tolerate this endless torment at home.
I just can't go on any more."
And she broke out into such a crying fit that her tears flowed out down onto her mother's face.
She wiped them off her mother with mechanical motions of her hands.
"Child," said the father sympathetically and with obvious appreciation, "then what should we do?"
The sister only shrugged her shoulders as a sign of the perplexity which, in contrast to her previous confidence, had come over her while she was crying.
"If only he understood us," said the father in a semi-questioning tone.
The sister, in the midst of her sobbing, shook her hand energetically as a sign that there was no point thinking of that.
"If he only understood us," repeated the father and by shutting his eyes he absorbed the sister's conviction of the impossibility of this point, "then perhaps some compromise would be possible with him.
But as it is. . ." "It must be gotten rid of," cried the sister.
"That is the only way, father.
You must try to get rid of the idea that this is Gregor.
The fact that we have believed for so long, that is truly our real misfortune.
But how can it be Gregor?
If it were Gregor, he would have long ago realized that a communal life among human beings is not possible with such an animal and would have gone away voluntarily.
Then we would not have a brother, but we could go on living and honour his memory.
But this animal plagues us.
It drives away the lodgers, will obviously take over the entire apartment, and leave us to spend the night in the alley.
Just look, father," she suddenly cried out,
"he's already starting up again."
With a fright which was totally incomprehensible to Gregor, the sister even left the mother, pushed herself away from her chair, as if she would sooner sacrifice her mother than remain in Gregor's vicinity, and rushed behind her father who, excited merely by her behaviour, also stood up and half raised his arms in front of the sister as though to protect her.
But Gregor did not have any notion of wishing to create problems for anyone and certainly not for his sister.
He had just started to turn himself around in order to creep back into his room, quite a startling sight, since, as a result of his suffering condition, he had to guide himself through the difficulty of turning around with his head, in this process lifting and banging it against the floor several times.
He paused and looked around.
His good intentions seem to have been recognized.
Now they looked at him in silence and sorrow.
His mother lay in her chair, with her legs stretched out and pressed together; her eyes were almost shut from weariness. The father and sister sat next to one another.
The sister had set her hands around the father's neck.
"Now perhaps I can actually turn myself around," thought Gregor and began the task again.
He couldn't stop puffing at the effort and had to rest now and then.
Besides, no one was urging him on.
It was all left to him on his own.
When he had completed turning around, he immediately began to wander straight back.
He was astonished at the great distance which separated him from his room and did not understand in the least how in his weakness he had covered the same distance a short time before, almost without noticing it.
Constantly intent only on creeping along quickly, he hardly paid any attention to the fact that no word or cry from his family interrupted him.
Only when he was already in the door did he turn his head, not completely, because he felt his neck growing stiff.
At any rate he still saw that behind him nothing had changed.
Only the sister was standing up.
His last glimpse brushed over the mother who was now completely asleep.
Hardly was he inside his room when the door was pushed shut very quickly, bolted fast, and barred.
Gregor was startled by the sudden commotion behind him, so much so that his little
limbs bent double under him.
It was his sister who had been in such a hurry.
She had stood up right away, had waited, and had then sprung forward nimbly.
Gregor had not heard anything of her approach.
She cried out "Finally!" to her parents, as she turned the key in the lock.
Gregor asked himself and looked around him in the darkness.
He soon made the discovery that he could no longer move at all.
He was not surprised at that.
On the contrary, it struck him as unnatural that up to this point he had really been able up to move around with these thin little legs.
Besides he felt relatively content.
True, he had pains throughout his entire body, but it seemed to him that they were gradually becoming weaker and weaker and would finally go away completely.
He remembered his family with deep feelings of love.
In this business, his own thought that he had to disappear was, if possible, even more decisive than his sister's.
He remained in this state of empty and peaceful reflection until the tower clock struck three o'clock in the morning.
From the window he witnessed the beginning of the general dawning outside.
Then without willing it, his head sank all the way down, and from his nostrils flowed out weakly his last breath.
Early in the morning the cleaning woman came.
In her sheer energy and haste she banged all the doors--in precisely the way people had already asked her to avoid--so much so that once she arrived a quiet sleep was no longer possible anywhere in the entire apartment.
In her customarily brief visit to Gregor she at first found nothing special.
She thought he lay so immobile there because he wanted to play the offended party. She gave him credit for as complete an understanding as possible.
Since she happened to be holding the long broom in her hand, she tried to tickle
Gregor with it from the door.
When that was quite unsuccessful, she became irritated and poked Gregor a little, and only when she had shoved him from his place without any resistance did she become attentive.
When she quickly realized the true state of affairs, her eyes grew large, she whistled to herself.
However, she didn't restrain herself for long.
She pulled open the door of the bedroom and yelled in a loud voice into the darkness,
"Come and look.
It's kicked the bucket.
It's lying there, totally snuffed!"
The Samsa married couple sat upright in their marriage bed and had to get over their fright at the cleaning woman before they managed to grasp her message.
But then Mr. and Mrs. Samsa climbed very quickly out of bed, one on either side.
Mr. Samsa threw the bedspread over his shoulders, Mrs. Samsa came out only in her night-shirt, and like this they stepped into Gregor's room.
Meanwhile, the door of the living room, in which Grete had slept since the lodgers had arrived on the scene, had also opened.
She was fully clothed, as if she had not slept at all; her white face also seem to indicate that.
"Dead?" said Mrs. Samsa and looked questioningly at the cleaning woman, although she could check everything on her own and even understand without a check.
"I should say so," said the cleaning woman and, by way of proof, poked Gregor's body with the broom a considerable distance more to the side.
Mrs. Samsa made a movement as if she wished to restrain the broom, but didn't do it.
"Well," said Mr. Samsa, "now we can give thanks to God."
He crossed himself, and the three women followed his example.
Grete, who did not take her eyes off the corpse, said, "Look how thin he was.
He had eaten nothing for such a long time.
The meals which came in here came out again exactly the same."
In fact, Gregor's body was completely flat and dry.
That was apparent really for the first time, now that he was no longer raised on his small limbs and nothing else distracted one's gaze.
"Grete, come into us for a moment," said Mrs. Samsa with a melancholy smile, and
Grete went, not without looking back at the corpse, behind her parents into the bed room.
The cleaning woman shut the door and opened the window wide.
In spite of the early morning, the fresh air was partly tinged with warmth.
It was already the end of March.
The three lodgers stepped out of their room and looked around for their breakfast, astonished that they had been forgotten.
"Where is the breakfast?" asked the middle one of the gentlemen grumpily to the cleaning woman.
However, she laid her finger to her lips and then quickly and silently indicated to the lodgers that they could come into Gregor's room.
So they came and stood in the room, which was already quite bright, around Gregor's corpse, their hands in the pockets of their somewhat worn jackets.
Then the door of the bed room opened, and Mr. Samsa appeared in his uniform, with his wife on one arm and his daughter on the other.
All were a little tear stained.
Now and then Grete pressed her face onto her father's arm.
"Get out of my apartment immediately," said Mr. Samsa and pulled open the door, without letting go of the women.
"What do you mean?" said the middle lodger, somewhat dismayed and with a sugary smile.
The two others kept their hands behind them and constantly rubbed them against each other, as if in joyful anticipation of a great squabble which must end up in their favour.
"I mean exactly what I say," replied Mr. Samsa and went directly with his two female companions up to the lodger.
The latter at first stood there motionless and looked at the floor, as if matters were arranging themselves in a new way in his head.
"All right, then we'll go," he said and looked up at Mr. Samsa as if, suddenly overcome by humility, he was asking fresh permission for this decision.
Mr. Samsa merely nodded to him repeatedly with his eyes open wide.
Following that, the lodger actually went with long strides immediately out into the hall.
His two friends had already been listening for a while with their hands quite still, and now they hopped smartly after him, as if afraid that Mr. Samsa could step into the hall ahead of them and disturb their reunion with their leader.
In the hall all three of them took their hats from the coat rack, pulled their canes from the cane holder, bowed silently, and left the apartment.
In what turned out to be an entirely groundless mistrust, Mr. Samsa stepped with the two women out onto the landing, leaned against the railing, and looked over as the three lodgers slowly but steadily made their way down the long staircase, disappeared on each floor in a certain turn of the stairwell, and in a few seconds came out again.
The deeper they proceeded, the more the Samsa family lost interest in them, and when a butcher with a tray on his head come to meet them and then with a proud bearing ascended the stairs high above them, Mr.
Samsa., together with the women, left the banister, and they all returned, as if relieved, back into their apartment.
They decided to pass that day resting and going for a stroll.
Not only had they earned this break from work, but there was no question that they really needed it.
And so they sat down at the table and wrote three letters of apology:
Mr. Samsa to his supervisor, Mrs. Samsa to her client, and Grete to her proprietor.
During the writing the cleaning woman came in to say that she was going off, for her morning work was finished.
The three people writing at first merely nodded, without glancing up.
Only when the cleaning woman was still unwilling to depart, did they look up angrily.
"Well?" asked Mr. Samsa.
The cleaning woman stood smiling in the doorway, as if she had a great stroke of
luck to report to the family but would only do it if she was asked directly.
The almost upright small ostrich feather in her hat, which had irritated Mr. Samsa during her entire service, swayed lightly in all directions.
"All right then, what do you really want?" asked Mrs. Samsa, whom the cleaning lady still usually respected.
"Well," answered the cleaning woman, smiling so happily she couldn't go on speaking right away, "about how that rubbish from the next room should be thrown out, you mustn't worry about it.
It's all taken care of."
Mrs. Samsa and Grete bent down to their letters, as though they wanted to go on writing.
Mr. Samsa, who noticed that the cleaning woman wanted to start describing everything in detail, decisively prevented her with an outstretched hand.
But since she was not allowed to explain, she remembered the great hurry she was in, and called out, clearly insulted, "Bye bye, everyone," turned around furiously and left the apartment with a fearful slamming of the door.
"This evening she'll be let go," said Mr. Samsa, but he got no answer from either his wife or from his daughter, because the cleaning woman seemed to have upset once again the tranquillity they had just attained.
They got up, went to the window, and remained there, with their arms about each other.
Mr. Samsa turned around in his chair in their direction and observed them quietly for a while.
Then he called out, "All right, come here then.
Let's finally get rid of old things.
And have a little consideration for me."
They rushed to him, caressed him, and quickly ended their letters.
Then all three left the apartment together, something they had not done for months now, and took the electric tram into the open air outside the city.
The car in which they were sitting by themselves was totally engulfed by the warm sun.
Leaning back comfortably in their seats, they talked to each other about future prospects, and they discovered that on closer observation these were not at all bad, for the three of them had employment, about which they had not really questioned each other at all, which was extremely favourable and with especially promising prospects.
The greatest improvement in their situation at this moment, of course, had to come from a change of dwelling.
Now they wanted to rent an apartment smaller and cheaper but better situated and generally more practical than the present one, which Gregor had found.
While they amused themselves in this way, it struck Mr. and Mrs. Samsa, almost at the same moment, how their daughter, who was getting more animated all the time, had blossomed recently, in spite of all the troubles which had made her cheeks pale, into a beautiful and voluptuous young woman.
Growing more silent and almost unconsciously understanding each other in their glances, they thought that the time was now at hand to seek out a good honest man for her.
And it was something of a confirmation of their new dreams and good intentions when at the end of their journey their daughter got up first and stretched her young body.
Today I'm going to talk about unexpected discoveries.
Now I work in the solar technology industry.
And my small startup is looking to force ourselves into the environment by paying attention to ...
... paying attention to crowd-sourcing.
It's just a quick video of what we do.
Huh.
Hang on a moment.
It might take a moment to load.
(Laughter)
We'll just -- we can just skip -- I'll just skip through the video instead ... (Laughter)
No.
(Laughter)
(Laughter)
(Music)
This is not ...
(Laughter)
Okay.
(Laughter)
Solar technology is ...
Oh, that's all my time?
Okay.
Thank you very much.

Really, I think he should focus on the fact that his boyfriend was stalking Jcub.
Sorry.
Seriously,
I think we need to call Detective Winters and give him this information.
Oh, plus I need a date for the GLADD Awards on the 26th.
You think that detective has a crush on you?
And I'm the diluted one for thinking that my boyfriend isn't a vicious killer.

Okay, maybe Chad was infatuated with Wood's body 15 years ago but
I think he sees me as the whole package.
I have a big cock too!
Oh my God.
Honestly, I could actually see the two of us maybe settling down some day.
Settling down?
Oh, you're going to settle down, is that the deal?
What are you going to buy a house with him? and moved to the Valley?
Is that it?
Yeah, right Reggie.
You're not gonna settle down.
No, what you're gonna do is you're going to travel the globe and you're gonna sleep with every big, hot, hairy, gay bear you can find.
Hey, I got an idea.
Why don't you cruise the United Nations.
It'll save you money on plane fare.
You don't want to settle down.
And you're not looking for love.
Okay, you're looking for dick!
Get real!
Okay, Nelson.
You want to get real.
Let's get real with you.
You're a greying, middle-aged, gay guy.
Still trying to make it in the most youth obsessed industries in the world.
You always make such a huge event out of when you don't get cast for something. when, honestly, it would be a huge event if you DlD actually get cast in something.
You did not just say that to me.
Quit it guys!
I'm fucking sick of this shit!
Oh my God.
Did he just say shit?
Yeah, I think he's really mad.
Yeah, you're damn right I am.
You guys are always ganging up on me.
And acting like I'm stupid all the time.
Well, guess what.
At least I'm smart enough to know that we all love each other.
And we need to stick together in times like these.
Especially, when one of us might be in danger because he's dating a murderer.
Oh my God.
We're back to that again.
I cannot believe you two!
I'm crazy about that guy!
And you know what?
It hurts my feelings that you don't trust me enough to know if somebody's taking advantage of me or lying to me.
You know what?
Todd is a good guy and I don't think he killed anybody.
What about Jcub's standup act?
That doesn't prove anything!
Performers make crap up all the time to get laughs!
Come on, Nelson.
How much more proof do you need?
You know what Reggie.
You get to have sex with all of these really gorgeous man all the time.
And then now I finally meet somebody that's beautiful and amazing. and I'm crazy about him. and you wont even give me that!
Do you always have to win? Huh?
Is that the deal?
Do you always have to get the guy?
Why won't you just give me this?
Nelson, you know that's not true.
You know, I can't even be around you guys right now.
Where are you going?
Before we get into the meat of algebra, I want to give you a quote from one of the greatest minds in human history, Galileo Galilei, because I think this quote encapsulates the true point of algebra and really mathematics in general.
He said : Philosophy is written in that great book which ever lies before our eyes -- I mean the universe -- but we cannot understand it if we do not first learn the language and grasp the symbols in which it is written.
This book is written in the mathematical language... without which one wanders in vain through a dark labyrinth. So very dramatic but very deep and this really is the point of mathematics and what we'll see as we start getting deeper and deeper into algebra is that we're gonna start abstracting things and we're going to start getting to core ideas that start explaining really how the universe is structured.

Will Lee Tae Ik be all right here?
He said so himself. &lt;i&gt; President L.J. &lt;/i&gt;
Oh, our Stylist Jang.
I hadn't thought you were, but apparently you are very talented.
Come back to work starting tomorrow!
Excuse me?
What do you mean by that?
Kang Hwi will start his work in earnest, so come to work as usual.
I do not want to.
You don't want to?
Yes. I don't want to work at U Entertainment anymore.
Stylist Jang, have you forgotten your debt to me?
Didn't you make a big deal over repaying your debt by working for me?
I thought that debt was repaid with the contract engagement.
That's what you said.
In this business, there is something more important than words.
This paper. &lt;br /&gt;The contract that you signed, Stylist Jang!
Did I ever write a contract &lt;br /&gt;saying your debt will be repaid&lt;br /&gt;if you have an engagement?
But... President, you clearly said...
Oh, our stylist Jang. I thought you were smart.&lt;br /&gt;But now that I look at you, you're still a child.
You don't know how the real world works... &lt;br /&gt;What shall we do?
Do you know why people are so obsessed with contracts?
A verbal contract is of no use.
There is no evidence.
It's more so when there is no witness.
There is a witness.
Who?
Oh!
Tae Ik!
Then call him out.
Should we call him and have a three-party encounter at court?
If you're so against working here, &lt;br /&gt;then repay your debt.
If not, come back and start working according to the contract!
I'll give you one week's time.
Even then if you are uncooperative, &lt;br /&gt;then there is nothing I can do, but act according to the law!
Ah!
Seriously!
What a guy! A con! Bastard!
Why are you like that?
Boasting a 50 year tradition, affiliated to the Korean Hapkido Association,
I am Jang Man Ok, the master of Man Ok Kwan.
Oh, Seriously... &lt;i&gt;Subtitles brought to you by The Maid of House 2 Team @Viki.com&lt;/i&gt;
Jang Man.
Jang Man!
Jang Man!
Why aren't you sleeping and calling me?
Jang Man, ... this house is weird.
Huh?
Why?
You can't sleep because it is uncomfortable?
I think there is somebody here.
Huh?
Are you talking about Senior Manager Hwang?
No, scatter, scatter...
It's full of crawling strange things that make these noises.
Scatter?
Ah! Something like cockroaches?
I wondered what it was.
This is not a place inhabitable by humans.
Why are you making it sound so serious because of cockroaches.
Spray some insecticide. Or catch them by smashing them with some tissue.
You savage!
How can a woman catch insects so easily?
Seriously!
Then learn to live on good terms with the insects.
It would have been good if you followed me earlier.
Forget it!
Where are you now?
You aren't at home, are you?
I'm at home.
Bull shit!
What?
What did you say?
Bull shit?
Lee Tae Ik, you also use words like that?
You aren't at home.
I am at home.
How can you insist without seeing?
I can see you now.
What?
What is this?
Please...
What?
Please let me sleep here.
What are you doing?
Why are you setting up a tent in the middle of the night?
I am making your private quarters.
Private quarters?
Hey!
Are you telling me to sleep in a tent?
Why? Is that not allowed?
Now, I am the owner of the house. It is up to me where I make you sleep.
There is a room in the main building, isn't there?
I will sleep there. Jang Man, you can sleep in the tent!
STOP!
In the owner's room?
How dare you!
You dare go in!
If you don't like sleeping here, then go back to Senior Manager Hwang's house?
But will you be alright?
Scatter, Scatter, Scatter, Scatter ....
If they crawl on your body.
STOP!
I get it.
The tent or private quarters or whatever,&lt;br /&gt;just hurry and set it up!
It's done.
It's cushiony!
The mood is good!
Come in, I laid down all the blankets.
Come on top of it!
It's cushiony and better than you think.
Come here!
How is it?
It's cushiony, isn't it?
Well... I will be sleeping for just a night. It's not bad.
If you sleep here for just a night, what about tomorrow?
Are you going back to Senior Manager Hwang's place?
Why would I go back there?
I tell you that place is not for humans.
So, don't complain and stay here for the time being.
Also, it is not for free.
Ah! Fine!
I will pay you rent.
Of course.
It would be weird to think you&lt;br /&gt;could sleep in someone else's house for free.
You stayed in my house for free.
Hey, that's not true.
I was forced into living in exile because of your problem.
You came voluntarily on your own feet to my house.
So the story is completely different!
Instead! I will do you a big favor.
I won't ask for a deposit but only receive monthly rent, according to market prices.
Ah!
So, don't fell burdened and stay here comfortably.
The longer you stay, the better for me as I earn more money.
Would you like me to... stay here for a long time?
Y... yes, of course!
Only then will you pay a lot of rent!
Go to sleep under the covers.
Oh! It's cold.
Ah, yeah.
Why am I like this?
Why are you blushing?
Pull yourself together, Jang Man Ok.
He is a star, a star!
A star in the night sky.
You know?
You will only get hurt by giving him your heart! &lt;i&gt;Subtitles brought to you by The Maid of House 2 Team @Viki.com
I want to see you.
My real star...
Won Kang Hwi!
You gave me a fright.
What are you doing?
You haven't even turned on the lights.
What is this?
It's so untidy!
Don't touch it.
If you take off even one of them, &lt;br /&gt;I will not leave you alone!
What is this?
Why has he stuck these on the floor like a kid?
I don't like him!

The pale Usher--threadbare in coat, heart, body, and brain; I see him now.
He was ever dusting his old lexicons and grammars, with a queer handkerchief, mockingly embellished with all the gay flags of all the known nations of the world.
He loved to dust his old grammars; it somehow mildly reminded him of his mortality.

EXTRACTS (Supplied by a Sub-Sub-Librarian).
It will be seen that this mere painstaking burrower and grub-worm of a poor devil of a
Sub-Sub appears to have gone through the long Vaticans and street-stalls of the earth, picking up whatever random allusions to whales he could anyways find in any book whatsoever, sacred or profane.
Therefore you must not, in every case at least, take the higgledy-piggledy whale statements, however authentic, in these extracts, for veritable gospel cetology.
Far from it.
As touching the ancient authors generally, as well as the poets here appearing, these extracts are solely valuable or entertaining, as affording a glancing bird's eye view of what has been promiscuously said, thought, fancied, and sung of Leviathan, by many nations and generations, including our own.
So fare thee well, poor devil of a Sub-Sub, whose commentator I am.
Thou belongest to that hopeless, sallow tribe which no wine of this world will ever warm; and for whom even Pale Sherry would be too rosy-strong; but with whom one sometimes loves to sit, and feel poor- devilish, too; and grow convivial upon tears; and say to them bluntly, with full eyes and empty glasses, and in not altogether unpleasant sadness--Give it up,
Sub-Subs!
For by how much the more pains ye take to please the world, by so much the more shall ye for ever go thankless!
Would that I could clear out Hampton Court and the Tuileries for ye!
But gulp down your tears and hie aloft to the royal-mast with your hearts; for your friends who have gone before are clearing out the seven-storied heavens, and making refugees of long-pampered Gabriel, Michael, and Raphael, against your coming.
Here ye strike but splintered hearts together--there, ye shall strike unsplinterable glasses!

"The quantity of line withdrawn from the boats engaged in the capture of this one whale, amounted altogether to 10,440 yards or nearly six English miles....

"Mad with the agonies he endures from these fresh attacks, the infuriated Sperm Whale rolls over and over; he rears his enormous head, and with wide expanded jaws snaps at everything around him; he rushes at the boats with his head; they are propelled before him with vast swiftness, and sometimes utterly destroyed....
It is a matter of great astonishment that the consideration of the habits of so interesting, and, in a commercial point of view, so important an animal (as the Sperm
Whale) should have been so entirely neglected, or should have excited so little curiosity among the numerous, and many of them competent observers, that of late years, must have possessed the most abundant and the most convenient opportunities of witnessing their habitudes."

Loomings.
Call me Ishmael.
Some years ago--never mind how long precisely--having little or no money in my purse, and nothing particular to interest me on shore, I thought I would sail about a little and see the watery part of the world.
It is a way I have of driving off the spleen and regulating the circulation.
Whenever I find myself growing grim about the mouth; whenever it is a damp, drizzly
November in my soul; whenever I find myself involuntarily pausing before coffin warehouses, and bringing up the rear of every funeral I meet; and especially whenever my hypos get such an upper hand of me, that it requires a strong moral principle to prevent me from deliberately stepping into the street, and methodically knocking people's hats off--then, I account it high time to get to sea as soon as I can.
This is my substitute for pistol and ball.
With a philosophical flourish Cato throws himself upon his sword; I quietly take to the ship.
There is nothing surprising in this.
If they but knew it, almost all men in their degree, some time or other, cherish very nearly the same feelings towards the ocean with me.
There now is your insular city of the Manhattoes, belted round by wharves as
Indian isles by coral reefs--commerce surrounds it with her surf.
Right and left, the streets take you waterward.
Its extreme downtown is the battery, where that noble mole is washed by waves, and cooled by breezes, which a few hours previous were out of sight of land.
Look at the crowds of water-gazers there.
Circumambulate the city of a dreamy Sabbath afternoon.
Go from Corlears Hook to Coenties Slip, and from thence, by Whitehall, northward.
What do you see?--Posted like silent sentinels all around the town, stand thousands upon thousands of mortal men fixed in ocean reveries.
Some leaning against the spiles; some seated upon the pier-heads; some looking over the bulwarks of ships from China; some high aloft in the rigging, as if striving to get a still better seaward peep.
But these are all landsmen; of week days pent up in lath and plaster--tied to counters, nailed to benches, clinched to desks.
How then is this?
Are the green fields gone?
What do they here?
But look! here come more crowds, pacing straight for the water, and seemingly bound for a dive.
Strange!
Nothing will content them but the extremest
limit of the land; loitering under the shady lee of yonder warehouses will not suffice.
No. They must get just as nigh the water as they possibly can without falling in.
And there they stand--miles of them-- leagues.
Inlanders all, they come from lanes and alleys, streets and avenues--north, east, south, and west.
Yet here they all unite.
Tell me, does the magnetic virtue of the needles of the compasses of all those ships attract them thither?
Once more.
Say you are in the country; in some high land of lakes.
Take almost any path you please, and ten to one it carries you down in a dale, and leaves you there by a pool in the stream.
There is magic in it.
Let the most absent-minded of men be plunged in his deepest reveries--stand that man on his legs, set his feet a-going, and he will infallibly lead you to water, if water there be in all that region.
Should you ever be athirst in the great American desert, try this experiment, if your caravan happen to be supplied with a metaphysical professor.
Yes, as every one knows, meditation and water are wedded for ever.
But here is an artist.
He desires to paint you the dreamiest, shadiest, quietest, most enchanting bit of romantic landscape in all the valley of the Saco.
What is the chief element he employs?
There stand his trees, each with a hollow trunk, as if a hermit and a crucifix were within; and here sleeps his meadow, and there sleep his cattle; and up from yonder cottage goes a sleepy smoke.
Deep into distant woodlands winds a mazy way, reaching to overlapping spurs of mountains bathed in their hill-side blue.
But though the picture lies thus tranced, and though this pine-tree shakes down its sighs like leaves upon this shepherd's head, yet all were vain, unless the shepherd's eye were fixed upon the magic stream before him.
Go visit the Prairies in June, when for scores on scores of miles you wade knee- deep among Tiger-lilies--what is the one charm wanting?--Water--there is not a drop of water there!
Were Niagara but a cataract of sand, would you travel your thousand miles to see it?
Why did the poor poet of Tennessee, upon suddenly receiving two handfuls of silver, deliberate whether to buy him a coat, which he sadly needed, or invest his money in a pedestrian trip to Rockaway Beach?
Why is almost every robust healthy boy with a robust healthy soul in him, at some time or other crazy to go to sea?
Why upon your first voyage as a passenger, did you yourself feel such a mystical vibration, when first told that you and your ship were now out of sight of land?
Why did the old Persians hold the sea holy?
Why did the Greeks give it a separate deity, and own brother of Jove?
Surely all this is not without meaning.
And still deeper the meaning of that story of Narcissus, who because he could not grasp the tormenting, mild image he saw in the fountain, plunged into it and was drowned.
But that same image, we ourselves see in all rivers and oceans.
It is the image of the ungraspable phantom of life; and this is the key to it all.
Now, when I say that I am in the habit of going to sea whenever I begin to grow hazy about the eyes, and begin to be over conscious of my lungs, I do not mean to have it inferred that I ever go to sea as a passenger.
For to go as a passenger you must needs have a purse, and a purse is but a rag unless you have something in it.
Besides, passengers get sea-sick--grow quarrelsome--don't sleep of nights--do not enjoy themselves much, as a general thing;- -no, I never go as a passenger; nor, though
I am something of a salt, do I ever go to sea as a Commodore, or a Captain, or a Cook.
I abandon the glory and distinction of such offices to those who like them.
For my part, I abominate all honourable respectable toils, trials, and tribulations of every kind whatsoever.
It is quite as much as I can do to take care of myself, without taking care of ships, barques, brigs, schooners, and what not.
And as for going as cook,--though I confess there is considerable glory in that, a cook being a sort of officer on ship-board--yet, somehow, I never fancied broiling fowls;-- though once broiled, judiciously buttered, and judgmatically salted and peppered, there is no one who will speak more respectfully, not to say reverentially, of a broiled fowl than I will.
It is out of the idolatrous dotings of the old Egyptians upon broiled ibis and roasted river horse, that you see the mummies of those creatures in their huge bake-houses the pyramids.
No, when I go to sea, I go as a simple sailor, right before the mast, plumb down into the forecastle, aloft there to the royal mast-head.
True, they rather order me about some, and make me jump from spar to spar, like a grasshopper in a May meadow.
And at first, this sort of thing is unpleasant enough.
It touches one's sense of honour, particularly if you come of an old established family in the land, the Van Rensselaers, or Randolphs, or Hardicanutes.
And more than all, if just previous to putting your hand into the tar-pot, you have been lording it as a country schoolmaster, making the tallest boys stand in awe of you.
The transition is a keen one, I assure you, from a schoolmaster to a sailor, and requires a strong decoction of Seneca and the Stoics to enable you to grin and bear it.
But even this wears off in time.
What of it, if some old hunks of a sea- captain orders me to get a broom and sweep down the decks?
What does that indignity amount to, weighed, I mean, in the scales of the New
Testament?
Do you think the archangel Gabriel thinks anything the less of me, because I promptly and respectfully obey that old hunks in that particular instance?
Who ain't a slave?
Tell me that.
Well, then, however the old sea-captains may order me about--however they may thump and punch me about, I have the satisfaction of knowing that it is all right; that everybody else is one way or other served in much the same way--either in a physical or metaphysical point of view, that is; and so the universal thump is passed round, and all hands should rub each other's shoulder- blades, and be content.
Again, I always go to sea as a sailor, because they make a point of paying me for my trouble, whereas they never pay passengers a single penny that I ever heard of.
On the contrary, passengers themselves must pay.
And there is all the difference in the world between paying and being paid.
The act of paying is perhaps the most uncomfortable infliction that the two orchard thieves entailed upon us.
But BElNG PAlD,--what will compare with it?
The urbane activity with which a man receives money is really marvellous, considering that we so earnestly believe money to be the root of all earthly ills, and that on no account can a monied man enter heaven.
Ah! how cheerfully we consign ourselves to perdition!
Finally, I always go to sea as a sailor, because of the wholesome exercise and pure air of the fore-castle deck.
For as in this world, head winds are far more prevalent than winds from astern (that is, if you never violate the Pythagorean maxim), so for the most part the Commodore on the quarter-deck gets his atmosphere at second hand from the sailors on the forecastle.
He thinks he breathes it first; but not so.
In much the same way do the commonalty lead their leaders in many other things, at the same time that the leaders little suspect it.
But wherefore it was that after having repeatedly smelt the sea as a merchant sailor, I should now take it into my head to go on a whaling voyage; this the invisible police officer of the Fates, who has the constant surveillance of me, and secretly dogs me, and influences me in some unaccountable way--he can better answer than any one else.
And, doubtless, my going on this whaling voyage, formed part of the grand programme of Providence that was drawn up a long time ago.
It came in as a sort of brief interlude and solo between more extensive performances.
I take it that this part of the bill must have run something like this:
"GRAND CONTESTED ELECTlON FOR THE PRESlDENCY OF THE UNlTED STATES.
"WHALlNG VOYAGE BY ONE ISHMAEL.
"BLOODY BATTLE IN AFFGHANlSTAN."
Though I cannot tell why it was exactly that those stage managers, the Fates, put me down for this shabby part of a whaling voyage, when others were set down for magnificent parts in high tragedies, and short and easy parts in genteel comedies, and jolly parts in farces--though I cannot tell why this was exactly; yet, now that I recall all the circumstances, I think I can see a little into the springs and motives which being cunningly presented to me under various disguises, induced me to set about performing the part I did, besides cajoling me into the delusion that it was a choice resulting from my own unbiased freewill and discriminating judgment.
Chief among these motives was the overwhelming idea of the great whale himself.
Such a portentous and mysterious monster roused all my curiosity.
Then the wild and distant seas where he rolled his island bulk; the undeliverable, nameless perils of the whale; these, with all the attending marvels of a thousand
Patagonian sights and sounds, helped to sway me to my wish.
With other men, perhaps, such things would not have been inducements; but as for me,
I am tormented with an everlasting itch for things remote.
I love to sail forbidden seas, and land on barbarous coasts.
Not ignoring what is good, I am quick to perceive a horror, and could still be social with it--would they let me--since it is but well to be on friendly terms with all the inmates of the place one lodges in.
By reason of these things, then, the whaling voyage was welcome; the great flood-gates of the wonder-world swung open, and in the wild conceits that swayed me to my purpose, two and two there floated into my inmost soul, endless processions of the whale, and, mid most of them all, one grand hooded phantom, like a snow hill in the air.
Chapter 2.
The Carpet-Bag.
I stuffed a shirt or two into my old carpet-bag, tucked it under my arm, and started for Cape Horn and the Pacific.
Quitting the good city of old Manhatto, I duly arrived in New Bedford.
It was a Saturday night in December.
Much was I disappointed upon learning that the little packet for Nantucket had already sailed, and that no way of reaching that place would offer, till the following
Monday.
As most young candidates for the pains and penalties of whaling stop at this same New
Bedford, thence to embark on their voyage, it may as well be related that I, for one, had no idea of so doing.
For my mind was made up to sail in no other than a Nantucket craft, because there was a fine, boisterous something about everything connected with that famous old island, which amazingly pleased me.
Besides though New Bedford has of late been gradually monopolising the business of whaling, and though in this matter poor old Nantucket is now much behind her, yet
Nantucket was her great original--the Tyre of this Carthage;--the place where the first dead American whale was stranded.
Where else but from Nantucket did those aboriginal whalemen, the Red-Men, first sally out in canoes to give chase to the Leviathan?
And where but from Nantucket, too, did that first adventurous little sloop put forth, partly laden with imported cobblestones--so goes the story--to throw at the whales, in order to discover when they were nigh enough to risk a harpoon from the bowsprit?
Now having a night, a day, and still another night following before me in New
Bedford, ere I could embark for my destined port, it became a matter of concernment where I was to eat and sleep meanwhile.
It was a very dubious-looking, nay, a very dark and dismal night, bitingly cold and cheerless.
I knew no one in the place.
With anxious grapnels I had sounded my pocket, and only brought up a few pieces of silver,--So, wherever you go, Ishmael, said I to myself, as I stood in the middle of a dreary street shouldering my bag, and comparing the gloom towards the north with the darkness towards the south--wherever in your wisdom you may conclude to lodge for the night, my dear Ishmael, be sure to inquire the price, and don't be too particular.
With halting steps I paced the streets, and passed the sign of "The Crossed Harpoons"-- but it looked too expensive and jolly there.
Further on, from the bright red windows of the "Sword-Fish Inn," there came such fervent rays, that it seemed to have melted the packed snow and ice from before the house, for everywhere else the congealed frost lay ten inches thick in a hard, asphaltic pavement,--rather weary for me, when I struck my foot against the flinty projections, because from hard, remorseless service the soles of my boots were in a most miserable plight.
Too expensive and jolly, again thought I, pausing one moment to watch the broad glare in the street, and hear the sounds of the tinkling glasses within.
But go on, Ishmael, said I at last; don't you hear? get away from before the door; your patched boots are stopping the way.
So on I went.
I now by instinct followed the streets that took me waterward, for there, doubtless, were the cheapest, if not the cheeriest inns.
Such dreary streets! blocks of blackness, not houses, on either hand, and here and there a candle, like a candle moving about in a tomb.
At this hour of the night, of the last day of the week, that quarter of the town proved all but deserted.
But presently I came to a smoky light proceeding from a low, wide building, the door of which stood invitingly open.
It had a careless look, as if it were meant for the uses of the public; so, entering, the first thing I did was to stumble over an ash-box in the porch.
Ha! thought I, ha, as the flying particles almost choked me, are these ashes from that destroyed city, Gomorrah?
But "The Crossed Harpoons," and "The Sword- Fish?"--this, then must needs be the sign of "The Trap."
However, I picked myself up and hearing a loud voice within, pushed on and opened a second, interior door.
It seemed the great Black Parliament sitting in Tophet.
A hundred black faces turned round in their rows to peer; and beyond, a black Angel of
Doom was beating a book in a pulpit.
It was a negro church; and the preacher's text was about the blackness of darkness, and the weeping and wailing and teeth- gnashing there.
Ha, Ishmael, muttered I, backing out, Wretched entertainment at the sign of 'The
Trap!'
Moving on, I at last came to a dim sort of light not far from the docks, and heard a forlorn creaking in the air; and looking up, saw a swinging sign over the door with a white painting upon it, faintly representing a tall straight jet of misty spray, and these words underneath--"The
Spouter Inn:--Peter Coffin."
Coffin?--Spouter?--Rather ominous in that particular connexion, thought I.
But it is a common name in Nantucket, they say, and I suppose this Peter here is an emigrant from there.
As the light looked so dim, and the place, for the time, looked quiet enough, and the dilapidated little wooden house itself looked as if it might have been carted here from the ruins of some burnt district, and as the swinging sign had a poverty-stricken sort of creak to it, I thought that here was the very spot for cheap lodgings, and the best of pea coffee.
It was a queer sort of place--a gable-ended old house, one side palsied as it were, and leaning over sadly.
It stood on a sharp bleak corner, where that tempestuous wind Euroclydon kept up a worse howling than ever it did about poor Paul's tossed craft.
Euroclydon, nevertheless, is a mighty pleasant zephyr to any one in-doors, with his feet on the hob quietly toasting for bed.
"In judging of that tempestuous wind called Euroclydon," says an old writer--of whose works I possess the only copy extant--"it maketh a marvellous difference, whether thou lookest out at it from a glass window where the frost is all on the outside, or whether thou observest it from that sashless window, where the frost is on both sides, and of which the wight Death is the only glazier."
True enough, thought I, as this passage occurred to my mind--old black-letter, thou reasonest well.
Yes, these eyes are windows, and this body of mine is the house.
What a pity they didn't stop up the chinks and the crannies though, and thrust in a little lint here and there.
But it's too late to make any improvements now.
The universe is finished; the copestone is on, and the chips were carted off a million years ago.
Poor Lazarus there, chattering his teeth against the curbstone for his pillow, and shaking off his tatters with his shiverings, he might plug up both ears with rags, and put a corn-cob into his mouth, and yet that would not keep out the tempestuous Euroclydon.
Euroclydon! says old Dives, in his red silken wrapper--(he had a redder one afterwards) pooh, pooh!
What a fine frosty night; how Orion glitters; what northern lights!
Let them talk of their oriental summer climes of everlasting conservatories; give me the privilege of making my own summer with my own coals.
But what thinks Lazarus?
Can he warm his blue hands by holding them up to the grand northern lights?
Would not Lazarus rather be in Sumatra than here?
Would he not far rather lay him down lengthwise along the line of the equator; yea, ye gods! go down to the fiery pit itself, in order to keep out this frost?
Now, that Lazarus should lie stranded there on the curbstone before the door of Dives, this is more wonderful than that an iceberg should be moored to one of the Moluccas.
Yet Dives himself, he too lives like a Czar in an ice palace made of frozen sighs, and being a president of a temperance society, he only drinks the tepid tears of orphans.
But no more of this blubbering now, we are going a-whaling, and there is plenty of that yet to come.
Let us scrape the ice from our frosted feet, and see what sort of a place this
"Spouter" may be. &gt;
-Chapter 3.
The Spouter-Inn.
Entering that gable-ended Spouter-Inn, you found yourself in a wide, low, straggling entry with old-fashioned wainscots, reminding one of the bulwarks of some condemned old craft.
On one side hung a very large oilpainting so thoroughly besmoked, and every way defaced, that in the unequal crosslights by which you viewed it, it was only by diligent study and a series of systematic visits to it, and careful inquiry of the neighbors, that you could any way arrive at an understanding of its purpose.
Such unaccountable masses of shades and shadows, that at first you almost thought some ambitious young artist, in the time of the New England hags, had endeavored to delineate chaos bewitched.
But by dint of much and earnest contemplation, and oft repeated ponderings, and especially by throwing open the little window towards the back of the entry, you at last come to the conclusion that such an idea, however wild, might not be altogether unwarranted.
But what most puzzled and confounded you was a long, limber, portentous, black mass of something hovering in the centre of the picture over three blue, dim, perpendicular
lines floating in a nameless yeast.
A boggy, soggy, squitchy picture truly, enough to drive a nervous man distracted.
Yet was there a sort of indefinite, half- attained, unimaginable sublimity about it that fairly froze you to it, till you involuntarily took an oath with yourself to find out what that marvellous painting meant.
Ever and anon a bright, but, alas, deceptive idea would dart you through.--
It's the Black Sea in a midnight gale.-- It's the unnatural combat of the four primal elements.--It's a blasted heath.--
It's a Hyperborean winter scene.--It's the breaking-up of the icebound stream of Time.
But at last all these fancies yielded to that one portentous something in the picture's midst.
THAT once found out, and all the rest were plain.
But stop; does it not bear a faint resemblance to a gigantic fish? even the great leviathan himself?
In fact, the artist's design seemed this: a final theory of my own, partly based upon the aggregated opinions of many aged persons with whom I conversed upon the subject.
The picture represents a Cape-Horner in a great hurricane; the half-foundered ship weltering there with its three dismantled masts alone visible; and an exasperated whale, purposing to spring clean over the craft, is in the enormous act of impaling himself upon the three mast-heads.
The opposite wall of this entry was hung all over with a heathenish array of monstrous clubs and spears.
Some were thickly set with glittering teeth resembling ivory saws; others were tufted with knots of human hair; and one was sickle-shaped, with a vast handle sweeping round like the segment made in the new-mown grass by a long-armed mower.
You shuddered as you gazed, and wondered what monstrous cannibal and savage could ever have gone a death-harvesting with such a hacking, horrifying implement.
Mixed with these were rusty old whaling lances and harpoons all broken and deformed.
Some were storied weapons.
With this once long lance, now wildly elbowed, fifty years ago did Nathan Swain kill fifteen whales between a sunrise and a sunset.
And that harpoon--so like a corkscrew now-- was flung in Javan seas, and run away with by a whale, years afterwards slain off the Cape of Blanco.
The original iron entered nigh the tail, and, like a restless needle sojourning in the body of a man, travelled full forty feet, and at last was found imbedded in the hump.
Crossing this dusky entry, and on through yon low-arched way--cut through what in old times must have been a great central chimney with fireplaces all round--you enter the public room.
A still duskier place is this, with such low ponderous beams above, and such old wrinkled planks beneath, that you would almost fancy you trod some old craft's cockpits, especially of such a howling night, when this corner-anchored old ark rocked so furiously.
On one side stood a long, low, shelf-like table covered with cracked glass cases, filled with dusty rarities gathered from this wide world's remotest nooks.
Projecting from the further angle of the room stands a dark-looking den--the bar--a rude attempt at a right whale's head.
Be that how it may, there stands the vast arched bone of the whale's jaw, so wide, a coach might almost drive beneath it.
Within are shabby shelves, ranged round with old decanters, bottles, flasks; and in those jaws of swift destruction, like another cursed Jonah (by which name indeed they called him), bustles a little withered old man, who, for their money, dearly sells the sailors deliriums and death.
Abominable are the tumblers into which he pours his poison.
Though true cylinders without--within, the villanous green goggling glasses deceitfully tapered downwards to a cheating bottom.
Parallel meridians rudely pecked into the glass, surround these footpads' goblets.
Fill to THlS mark, and your charge is but a penny; to THlS a penny more; and so on to the full glass--the Cape Horn measure, which you may gulp down for a shilling.
Upon entering the place I found a number of young seamen gathered about a table, examining by a dim light divers specimens of SKRlMSHANDER.
I sought the landlord, and telling him I desired to be accommodated with a room, received for answer that his house was full--not a bed unoccupied.
"But avast," he added, tapping his forehead, "you haint no objections to sharing a harpooneer's blanket, have ye?
I s'pose you are goin' a-whalin', so you'd better get used to that sort of thing."
I told him that I never liked to sleep two in a bed; that if I should ever do so, it would depend upon who the harpooneer might be, and that if he (the landlord) really had no other place for me, and the harpooneer was not decidedly objectionable, why rather than wander further about a strange town on so bitter a night, I would put up with the half of any decent man's blanket.
"I thought so.
All right; take a seat.
Supper?--you want supper?
Supper'll be ready directly."
I sat down on an old wooden settle, carved all over like a bench on the Battery.
At one end a ruminating tar was still further adorning it with his jack-knife, stooping over and diligently working away at the space between his legs.
He was trying his hand at a ship under full sail, but he didn't make much headway, I thought.
At last some four or five of us were summoned to our meal in an adjoining room.
It was cold as Iceland--no fire at all--the landlord said he couldn't afford it.
Nothing but two dismal tallow candles, each in a winding sheet.
We were fain to button up our monkey jackets, and hold to our lips cups of scalding tea with our half frozen fingers.
But the fare was of the most substantial kind--not only meat and potatoes, but dumplings; good heavens! dumplings for supper!
One young fellow in a green box coat, addressed himself to these dumplings in a most direful manner.
"My boy," said the landlord, "you'll have the nightmare to a dead sartainty."
"Landlord," I whispered, "that aint the harpooneer is it?"
"Oh, no," said he, looking a sort of diabolically funny, "the harpooneer is a dark complexioned chap.
He never eats dumplings, he don't--he eats nothing but steaks, and he likes 'em rare."
"The devil he does," says I. "Where is that harpooneer?
Is he here?"
"He'll be here afore long," was the answer.
I could not help it, but I began to feel suspicious of this "dark complexioned" harpooneer.
At any rate, I made up my mind that if it so turned out that we should sleep together, he must undress and get into bed before I did.
Supper over, the company went back to the bar-room, when, knowing not what else to do with myself, I resolved to spend the rest of the evening as a looker on.
Presently a rioting noise was heard without.
Starting up, the landlord cried, "That's the Grampus's crew.
I seed her reported in the offing this morning; a three years' voyage, and a full ship. Hurrah, boys; now we'll have the latest news from the Feegees."
A tramping of sea boots was heard in the entry; the door was flung open, and in rolled a wild set of mariners enough.
Enveloped in their shaggy watch coats, and with their heads muffled in woollen comforters, all bedarned and ragged, and their beards stiff with icicles, they seemed an eruption of bears from Labrador.
They had just landed from their boat, and this was the first house they entered.
No wonder, then, that they made a straight wake for the whale's mouth--the bar--when the wrinkled little old Jonah, there officiating, soon poured them out brimmers all round.
One complained of a bad cold in his head, upon which Jonah mixed him a pitch-like potion of gin and molasses, which he swore was a sovereign cure for all colds and catarrhs whatsoever, never mind of how long standing, or whether caught off the coast of Labrador, or on the weather side of an ice-island.
The liquor soon mounted into their heads, as it generally does even with the arrantest topers newly landed from sea, and they began capering about most obstreperously.
I observed, however, that one of them held somewhat aloof, and though he seemed desirous not to spoil the hilarity of his shipmates by his own sober face, yet upon the whole he refrained from making as much noise as the rest.
This man interested me at once; and since the sea-gods had ordained that he should soon become my shipmate (though but a sleeping-partner one, so far as this narrative is concerned), I will here venture upon a little description of him.
He stood full six feet in height, with noble shoulders, and a chest like a coffer- dam.
I have seldom seen such brawn in a man.
His face was deeply brown and burnt, making his white teeth dazzling by the contrast; while in the deep shadows of his eyes floated some reminiscences that did not seem to give him much joy.
His voice at once announced that he was a Southerner, and from his fine stature, I thought he must be one of those tall mountaineers from the Alleghanian Ridge in
Virginia.
When the revelry of his companions had mounted to its height, this man slipped away unobserved, and I saw no more of him till he became my comrade on the sea.
In a few minutes, however, he was missed by his shipmates, and being, it seems, for some reason a huge favourite with them, they raised a cry of "Bulkington!
Bulkington! where's Bulkington?" and darted out of the house in pursuit of him.
It was now about nine o'clock, and the room seeming almost supernaturally quiet after these orgies, I began to congratulate myself upon a little plan that had occurred to me just previous to the entrance of the seamen.
No man prefers to sleep two in a bed.
In fact, you would a good deal rather not sleep with your own brother.
I don't know how it is, but people like to be private when they are sleeping.
And when it comes to sleeping with an unknown stranger, in a strange inn, in a strange town, and that stranger a harpooneer, then your objections indefinitely multiply.
Nor was there any earthly reason why I as a sailor should sleep two in a bed, more than anybody else; for sailors no more sleep two in a bed at sea, than bachelor Kings do ashore.
To be sure they all sleep together in one apartment, but you have your own hammock, and cover yourself with your own blanket, and sleep in your own skin.
The more I pondered over this harpooneer, the more I abominated the thought of sleeping with him.
It was fair to presume that being a harpooneer, his linen or woollen, as the case might be, would not be of the tidiest, certainly none of the finest.
I began to twitch all over.
Besides, it was getting late, and my decent harpooneer ought to be home and going bedwards.
Suppose now, he should tumble in upon me at midnight--how could I tell from what vile hole he had been coming?
"Landlord!
I've changed my mind about that harpooneer.--I shan't sleep with him.
I'll try the bench here."
"Just as you please; I'm sorry I cant spare ye a tablecloth for a mattress, and it's a plaguy rough board here"--feeling of the knots and notches.
"But wait a bit, Skrimshander; I've got a carpenter's plane there in the bar--wait,
I say, and I'll make ye snug enough."
So saying he procured the plane; and with his old silk handkerchief first dusting the bench, vigorously set to planing away at my bed, the while grinning like an ape.
The shavings flew right and left; till at last the plane-iron came bump against an indestructible knot.
The landlord was near spraining his wrist, and I told him for heaven's sake to quit-- the bed was soft enough to suit me, and I did not know how all the planing in the world could make eider down of a pine plank.
So gathering up the shavings with another grin, and throwing them into the great stove in the middle of the room, he went about his business, and left me in a brown study.
I now took the measure of the bench, and found that it was a foot too short; but that could be mended with a chair.
But it was a foot too narrow, and the other bench in the room was about four inches higher than the planed one--so there was no yoking them.
I then placed the first bench lengthwise along the only clear space against the wall, leaving a little interval between, for my back to settle down in.
But I soon found that there came such a draught of cold air over me from under the sill of the window, that this plan would never do at all, especially as another current from the rickety door met the one from the window, and both together formed a series of small whirlwinds in the immediate vicinity of the spot where I had thought to spend the night.
The devil fetch that harpooneer, thought I, but stop, couldn't I steal a march on him-- bolt his door inside, and jump into his bed, not to be wakened by the most violent knockings?
It seemed no bad idea; but upon second thoughts I dismissed it.
For who could tell but what the next morning, so soon as I popped out of the room, the harpooneer might be standing in the entry, all ready to knock me down!
Still, looking round me again, and seeing no possible chance of spending a sufferable night unless in some other person's bed, I began to think that after all I might be cherishing unwarrantable prejudices against this unknown harpooneer.
Thinks I, I'll wait awhile; he must be dropping in before long.
I'll have a good look at him then, and perhaps we may become jolly good bedfellows after all--there's no telling.
But though the other boarders kept coming in by ones, twos, and threes, and going to bed, yet no sign of my harpooneer.
"Landlord!" said I, "what sort of a chap is he--does he always keep such late hours?"
It was now hard upon twelve o'clock.
The landlord chuckled again with his lean chuckle, and seemed to be mightily tickled at something beyond my comprehension.
"No," he answered, "generally he's an early bird--airley to bed and airley to rise-- yes, he's the bird what catches the worm.
But to-night he went out a peddling, you see, and I don't see what on airth keeps him so late, unless, may be, he can't sell his head."
"Can't sell his head?--What sort of a bamboozingly story is this you are telling me?" getting into a towering rage.
"Do you pretend to say, landlord, that this harpooneer is actually engaged this blessed
Saturday night, or rather Sunday morning, in peddling his head around this town?"
"That's precisely it," said the landlord, "and I told him he couldn't sell it here, the market's overstocked." "With what?" shouted I.
"With heads to be sure; ain't there too many heads in the world?"
"I tell you what it is, landlord," said I quite calmly, "you'd better stop spinning that yarn to me--I'm not green."
"May be not," taking out a stick and whittling a toothpick, "but I rayther guess you'll be done BROWN if that ere harpooneer hears you a slanderin' his head."
"I'll break it for him," said I, now flying into a passion again at this unaccountable farrago of the landlord's.
"It's broke a'ready," said he.
"Broke," said I--"BROKE, do you mean?"
"Sartain, and that's the very reason he can't sell it, I guess."
"Landlord," said I, going up to him as cool as Mt.
Hecla in a snow-storm--"landlord, stop whittling.
You and I must understand one another, and that too without delay.
I come to your house and want a bed; you tell me you can only give me half a one; that the other half belongs to a certain harpooneer.
And about this harpooneer, whom I have not yet seen, you persist in telling me the most mystifying and exasperating stories tending to beget in me an uncomfortable feeling towards the man whom you design for my bedfellow--a sort of connexion, landlord, which is an intimate and confidential one in the highest degree.
I now demand of you to speak out and tell me who and what this harpooneer is, and whether I shall be in all respects safe to spend the night with him.
And in the first place, you will be so good as to unsay that story about selling his head, which if true I take to be good evidence that this harpooneer is stark mad, and I've no idea of sleeping with a madman; and you, sir, YOU I mean, landlord, YOU, sir, by trying to induce me to do so knowingly, would thereby render yourself liable to a criminal prosecution."
"Wall," said the landlord, fetching a long breath, "that's a purty long sarmon for a chap that rips a little now and then.
But be easy, be easy, this here harpooneer I have been tellin' you of has just arrived from the south seas, where he bought up a lot of 'balmed New Zealand heads (great curios, you know), and he's sold all on 'em but one, and that one he's trying to sell to-night, cause to-morrow's Sunday, and it would not do to be sellin' human heads about the streets when folks is goin' to churches.
He wanted to, last Sunday, but I stopped him just as he was goin' out of the door with four heads strung on a string, for all the airth like a string of inions."
This account cleared up the otherwise unaccountable mystery, and showed that the landlord, after all, had had no idea of fooling me--but at the same time what could
I think of a harpooneer who stayed out of a
Saturday night clean into the holy Sabbath, engaged in such a cannibal business as selling the heads of dead idolators?
"Depend upon it, landlord, that harpooneer is a dangerous man."
"He pays reg'lar," was the rejoinder.
"But come, it's getting dreadful late, you had better be turning flukes--it's a nice bed; Sal and me slept in that ere bed the night we were spliced.
There's plenty of room for two to kick about in that bed; it's an almighty big bed that.
Why, afore we give it up, Sal used to put our Sam and little Johnny in the foot of it.
But I got a dreaming and sprawling about one night, and somehow, Sam got pitched on the floor, and came near breaking his arm.
Arter that, Sal said it wouldn't do.
Come along here, I'll give ye a glim in a jiffy;" and so saying he lighted a candle and held it towards me, offering to lead the way.
But I stood irresolute; when looking at a clock in the corner, he exclaimed "I vum it's Sunday--you won't see that harpooneer to-night; he's come to anchor somewhere-- come along then; DO come; WON'T ye come?"
I considered the matter a moment, and then up stairs we went, and I was ushered into a small room, cold as a clam, and furnished, sure enough, with a prodigious bed, almost big enough indeed for any four harpooneers to sleep abreast.
"There," said the landlord, placing the candle on a crazy old sea chest that did double duty as a wash-stand and centre table; "there, make yourself comfortable now, and good night to ye."
I turned round from eyeing the bed, but he had disappeared.
Folding back the counterpane, I stooped over the bed.
Though none of the most elegant, it yet stood the scrutiny tolerably well.
I then glanced round the room; and besides the bedstead and centre table, could see no other furniture belonging to the place, but a rude shelf, the four walls, and a papered fireboard representing a man striking a whale.
Of things not properly belonging to the room, there was a hammock lashed up, and thrown upon the floor in one corner; also a large seaman's bag, containing the harpooneer's wardrobe, no doubt in lieu of a land trunk.
Likewise, there was a parcel of outlandish bone fish hooks on the shelf over the fire- place, and a tall harpoon standing at the head of the bed.
But what is this on the chest?
I took it up, and held it close to the light, and felt it, and smelt it, and tried every way possible to arrive at some satisfactory conclusion concerning it.
I can compare it to nothing but a large door mat, ornamented at the edges with little tinkling tags something like the stained porcupine quills round an Indian moccasin.
There was a hole or slit in the middle of this mat, as you see the same in South
American ponchos.
But could it be possible that any sober harpooneer would get into a door mat, and parade the streets of any Christian town in that sort of guise?
I put it on, to try it, and it weighed me down like a hamper, being uncommonly shaggy and thick, and I thought a little damp, as though this mysterious harpooneer had been wearing it of a rainy day.
I went up in it to a bit of glass stuck against the wall, and I never saw such a sight in my life.
I tore myself out of it in such a hurry that I gave myself a kink in the neck.
I sat down on the side of the bed, and commenced thinking about this head-peddling harpooneer, and his door mat.
After thinking some time on the bed-side, I got up and took off my monkey jacket, and then stood in the middle of the room thinking.
I then took off my coat, and thought a little more in my shirt sleeves.
But beginning to feel very cold now, half undressed as I was, and remembering what the landlord said about the harpooneer's not coming home at all that night, it being so very late, I made no more ado, but jumped out of my pantaloons and boots, and then blowing out the light tumbled into bed, and commended myself to the care of heaven.
Whether that mattress was stuffed with corn-cobs or broken crockery, there is no telling, but I rolled about a good deal, and could not sleep for a long time.
At last I slid off into a light doze, and had pretty nearly made a good offing towards the land of Nod, when I heard a heavy footfall in the passage, and saw a glimmer of light come into the room from under the door.
Lord save me, thinks I, that must be the harpooneer, the infernal head-peddler.
But I lay perfectly still, and resolved not to say a word till spoken to.
Holding a light in one hand, and that identical New Zealand head in the other, the stranger entered the room, and without looking towards the bed, placed his candle a good way off from me on the floor in one corner, and then began working away at the knotted cords of the large bag I before spoke of as being in the room.
I was all eagerness to see his face, but he kept it averted for some time while employed in unlacing the bag's mouth.
This accomplished, however, he turned round--when, good heavens! what a sight!
Such a face!
It was of a dark, purplish, yellow colour, here and there stuck over with large blackish looking squares.
Yes, it's just as I thought, he's a terrible bedfellow; he's been in a fight, got dreadfully cut, and here he is, just from the surgeon.
But at that moment he chanced to turn his face so towards the light, that I plainly saw they could not be sticking-plasters at all, those black squares on his cheeks.
They were stains of some sort or other.
At first I knew not what to make of this; but soon an inkling of the truth occurred to me.
I remembered a story of a white man--a whaleman too--who, falling among the cannibals, had been tattooed by them.
I concluded that this harpooneer, in the course of his distant voyages, must have met with a similar adventure.
And what is it, thought I, after all!
It's only his outside; a man can be honest in any sort of skin.
But then, what to make of his unearthly complexion, that part of it, I mean, lying round about, and completely independent of the squares of tattooing.
To be sure, it might be nothing but a good coat of tropical tanning; but I never heard of a hot sun's tanning a white man into a purplish yellow one.
However, I had never been in the South Seas; and perhaps the sun there produced these extraordinary effects upon the skin.
Now, while all these ideas were passing through me like lightning, this harpooneer never noticed me at all.
But, after some difficulty having opened his bag, he commenced fumbling in it, and presently pulled out a sort of tomahawk, and a seal-skin wallet with the hair on.
Placing these on the old chest in the middle of the room, he then took the New
Zealand head--a ghastly thing enough--and crammed it down into the bag.
He now took off his hat--a new beaver hat-- when I came nigh singing out with fresh surprise.
There was no hair on his head--none to speak of at least--nothing but a small scalp-knot twisted up on his forehead.
His bald purplish head now looked for all the world like a mildewed skull.
Had not the stranger stood between me and the door, I would have bolted out of it quicker than ever I bolted a dinner.
Even as it was, I thought something of slipping out of the window, but it was the second floor back.
I am no coward, but what to make of this head-peddling purple rascal altogether passed my comprehension.
Ignorance is the parent of fear, and being completely nonplussed and confounded about the stranger, I confess I was now as much afraid of him as if it was the devil himself who had thus broken into my room at the dead of night.
In fact, I was so afraid of him that I was not game enough just then to address him, and demand a satisfactory answer concerning what seemed inexplicable in him.
Meanwhile, he continued the business of undressing, and at last showed his chest and arms.
As I live, these covered parts of him were checkered with the same squares as his face; his back, too, was all over the same dark squares; he seemed to have been in a
Thirty Years' War, and just escaped from it with a sticking-plaster shirt.
Still more, his very legs were marked, as if a parcel of dark green frogs were running up the trunks of young palms.
It was now quite plain that he must be some abominable savage or other shipped aboard of a whaleman in the South Seas, and so landed in this Christian country.
I quaked to think of it.
A peddler of heads too--perhaps the heads of his own brothers.
He might take a fancy to mine--heavens! look at that tomahawk!
But there was no time for shuddering, for now the savage went about something that completely fascinated my attention, and convinced me that he must indeed be a heathen.
Going to his heavy grego, or wrapall, or dreadnaught, which he had previously hung on a chair, he fumbled in the pockets, and produced at length a curious little deformed image with a hunch on its back, and exactly the colour of a three days' old Congo baby.
Remembering the embalmed head, at first I almost thought that this black manikin was a real baby preserved in some similar manner.
But seeing that it was not at all limber, and that it glistened a good deal like polished ebony, I concluded that it must be nothing but a wooden idol, which indeed it proved to be.
For now the savage goes up to the empty fire-place, and removing the papered fire- board, sets up this little hunch-backed image, like a tenpin, between the andirons.
The chimney jambs and all the bricks inside were very sooty, so that I thought this fire-place made a very appropriate little shrine or chapel for his Congo idol.
I now screwed my eyes hard towards the half hidden image, feeling but ill at ease meantime--to see what was next to follow.
First he takes about a double handful of shavings out of his grego pocket, and places them carefully before the idol; then laying a bit of ship biscuit on top and applying the flame from the lamp, he kindled the shavings into a sacrificial blaze.
Presently, after many hasty snatches into the fire, and still hastier withdrawals of his fingers (whereby he seemed to be scorching them badly), he at last succeeded in drawing out the biscuit; then blowing off the heat and ashes a little, he made a polite offer of it to the little negro.
But the little devil did not seem to fancy such dry sort of fare at all; he never moved his lips.
All these strange antics were accompanied by still stranger guttural noises from the devotee, who seemed to be praying in a sing-song or else singing some pagan psalmody or other, during which his face twitched about in the most unnatural manner.
At last extinguishing the fire, he took the idol up very unceremoniously, and bagged it again in his grego pocket as carelessly as if he were a sportsman bagging a dead woodcock.
All these queer proceedings increased my uncomfortableness, and seeing him now exhibiting strong symptoms of concluding his business operations, and jumping into bed with me, I thought it was high time, now or never, before the light was put out, to break the spell in which I had so long been bound.
But the interval I spent in deliberating what to say, was a fatal one.
Taking up his tomahawk from the table, he examined the head of it for an instant, and then holding it to the light, with his mouth at the handle, he puffed out great clouds of tobacco smoke.
The next moment the light was extinguished, and this wild cannibal, tomahawk between his teeth, sprang into bed with me.
I sang out, I could not help it now; and giving a sudden grunt of astonishment he began feeling me.
Stammering out something, I knew not what, I rolled away from him against the wall, and then conjured him, whoever or whatever he might be, to keep quiet, and let me get up and light the lamp again.
But his guttural responses satisfied me at once that he but ill comprehended my meaning.
"Who-e debel you?"--he at last said--"you no speak-e, dam-me, I kill-e."
And so saying the lighted tomahawk began flourishing about me in the dark.
"Landlord, for God's sake, Peter Coffin!" shouted I.
"Landlord!
Watch!
Coffin!
Angels! save me!"
"Speak-e! tell-ee me who-ee be, or dam-me, I kill-e!" again growled the cannibal, while his horrid flourishings of the tomahawk scattered the hot tobacco ashes about me till I thought my linen would get on fire.
But thank heaven, at that moment the landlord came into the room light in hand, and leaping from the bed I ran up to him.
"Don't be afraid now," said he, grinning again, "Queequeg here wouldn't harm a hair of your head."
"Stop your grinning," shouted I, "and why didn't you tell me that that infernal harpooneer was a cannibal?"
"I thought ye know'd it;--didn't I tell ye, he was a peddlin' heads around town?--but turn flukes again and go to sleep.
Queequeg, look here--you sabbee me, I sabbee--you this man sleepe you--you sabbee?"
"Me sabbee plenty"--grunted Queequeg, puffing away at his pipe and sitting up in bed.
"You gettee in," he added, motioning to me with his tomahawk, and throwing the clothes to one side.
He really did this in not only a civil but a really kind and charitable way.
I stood looking at him a moment.
For all his tattooings he was on the whole a clean, comely looking cannibal.
What's all this fuss I have been making about, thought I to myself--the man's a human being just as I am: he has just as much reason to fear me, as I have to be afraid of him.
Better sleep with a sober cannibal than a drunken Christian.
"Landlord," said I, "tell him to stash his tomahawk there, or pipe, or whatever you call it; tell him to stop smoking, in short, and I will turn in with him.
But I don't fancy having a man smoking in bed with me.
It's dangerous.
Besides, I ain't insured."
This being told to Queequeg, he at once complied, and again politely motioned me to get into bed--rolling over to one side as much as to say--"I won't touch a leg of ye."
"Good night, landlord," said I, "you may go."
I turned in, and never slept better in my life. &gt;
-Chapter 4.
The Counterpane.
Upon waking next morning about daylight, I found Queequeg's arm thrown over me in the most loving and affectionate manner.
You had almost thought I had been his wife.
The counterpane was of patchwork, full of odd little parti-coloured squares and triangles; and this arm of his tattooed all over with an interminable Cretan labyrinth of a figure, no two parts of which were of one precise shade--owing I suppose to his keeping his arm at sea unmethodically in sun and shade, his shirt sleeves irregularly rolled up at various times-- this same arm of his, I say, looked for all the world like a strip of that same patchwork quilt.
Indeed, partly lying on it as the arm did when I first awoke, I could hardly tell it from the quilt, they so blended their hues together; and it was only by the sense of weight and pressure that I could tell that Queequeg was hugging me.
My sensations were strange.
Let me try to explain them.
When I was a child, I well remember a somewhat similar circumstance that befell me; whether it was a reality or a dream, I never could entirely settle.
The circumstance was this.
I had been cutting up some caper or other-- I think it was trying to crawl up the chimney, as I had seen a little sweep do a few days previous; and my stepmother who, somehow or other, was all the time whipping me, or sending me to bed supperless,--my mother dragged me by the legs out of the chimney and packed me off to bed, though it was only two o'clock in the afternoon of the 21st June, the longest day in the year in our hemisphere.
I felt dreadfully.
But there was no help for it, so up stairs I went to my little room in the third floor, undressed myself as slowly as possible so as to kill time, and with a bitter sigh got between the sheets.
I lay there dismally calculating that sixteen entire hours must elapse before I could hope for a resurrection.
Sixteen hours in bed! the small of my back ached to think of it.
And it was so light too; the sun shining in at the window, and a great rattling of coaches in the streets, and the sound of gay voices all over the house.
I felt worse and worse--at last I got up, dressed, and softly going down in my stockinged feet, sought out my stepmother, and suddenly threw myself at her feet, beseeching her as a particular favour to give me a good slippering for my misbehaviour; anything indeed but condemning me to lie abed such an unendurable length of time.
But she was the best and most conscientious of stepmothers, and back I had to go to my room.
For several hours I lay there broad awake, feeling a great deal worse than I have ever done since, even from the greatest subsequent misfortunes.
At last I must have fallen into a troubled nightmare of a doze; and slowly waking from it--half steeped in dreams--I opened my eyes, and the before sun-lit room was now wrapped in outer darkness.
Instantly I felt a shock running through all my frame; nothing was to be seen, and nothing was to be heard; but a supernatural hand seemed placed in mine.
My arm hung over the counterpane, and the nameless, unimaginable, silent form or phantom, to which the hand belonged, seemed closely seated by my bed-side.
For what seemed ages piled on ages, I lay there, frozen with the most awful fears, not daring to drag away my hand; yet ever thinking that if I could but stir it one single inch, the horrid spell would be broken.
I knew not how this consciousness at last glided away from me; but waking in the morning, I shudderingly remembered it all, and for days and weeks and months afterwards I lost myself in confounding attempts to explain the mystery.
Nay, to this very hour, I often puzzle myself with it.
Now, take away the awful fear, and my sensations at feeling the supernatural hand in mine were very similar, in their strangeness, to those which I experienced on waking up and seeing Queequeg's pagan arm thrown round me.
But at length all the past night's events soberly recurred, one by one, in fixed reality, and then I lay only alive to the comical predicament.
For though I tried to move his arm--unlock his bridegroom clasp--yet, sleeping as he was, he still hugged me tightly, as though naught but death should part us twain.
I now strove to rouse him--"Queequeg!"--but his only answer was a snore.
I then rolled over, my neck feeling as if it were in a horse-collar; and suddenly felt a slight scratch.
Throwing aside the counterpane, there lay the tomahawk sleeping by the savage's side, as if it were a hatchet-faced baby.
A pretty pickle, truly, thought I; abed here in a strange house in the broad day, with a cannibal and a tomahawk!
"Queequeg!--in the name of goodness,
Queequeg, wake!"
At length, by dint of much wriggling, and loud and incessant expostulations upon the unbecomingness of his hugging a fellow male in that matrimonial sort of style, I succeeded in extracting a grunt; and presently, he drew back his arm, shook himself all over like a Newfoundland dog just from the water, and sat up in bed, stiff as a pike-staff, looking at me, and rubbing his eyes as if he did not altogether remember how I came to be there, though a dim consciousness of knowing something about me seemed slowly dawning over him.
Meanwhile, I lay quietly eyeing him, having no serious misgivings now, and bent upon narrowly observing so curious a creature.
When, at last, his mind seemed made up touching the character of his bedfellow, and he became, as it were, reconciled to the fact; he jumped out upon the floor, and by certain signs and sounds gave me to understand that, if it pleased me, he would dress first and then leave me to dress afterwards, leaving the whole apartment to myself.
Thinks I, Queequeg, under the circumstances, this is a very civilized overture; but, the truth is, these savages have an innate sense of delicacy, say what you will; it is marvellous how essentially polite they are.
I pay this particular compliment to Queequeg, because he treated me with so much civility and consideration, while I was guilty of great rudeness; staring at him from the bed, and watching all his toilette motions; for the time my curiosity getting the better of my breeding.
Nevertheless, a man like Queequeg you don't see every day, he and his ways were well worth unusual regarding.
He commenced dressing at top by donning his beaver hat, a very tall one, by the by, and then--still minus his trowsers--he hunted up his boots.
What under the heavens he did it for, I cannot tell, but his next movement was to crush himself--boots in hand, and hat on-- under the bed; when, from sundry violent gaspings and strainings, I inferred he was hard at work booting himself; though by no law of propriety that I ever heard of, is any man required to be private when putting on his boots.
But Queequeg, do you see, was a creature in the transition stage--neither caterpillar nor butterfly.
He was just enough civilized to show off his outlandishness in the strangest possible manners.
His education was not yet completed.
He was an undergraduate.
If he had not been a small degree civilized, he very probably would not have troubled himself with boots at all; but then, if he had not been still a savage, he never would have dreamt of getting under the bed to put them on.
At last, he emerged with his hat very much dented and crushed down over his eyes, and began creaking and limping about the room, as if, not being much accustomed to boots, his pair of damp, wrinkled cowhide ones-- probably not made to order either--rather pinched and tormented him at the first go off of a bitter cold morning.
Seeing, now, that there were no curtains to the window, and that the street being very narrow, the house opposite commanded a plain view into the room, and observing more and more the indecorous figure that
Queequeg made, staving about with little else but his hat and boots on; I begged him as well as I could, to accelerate his toilet somewhat, and particularly to get into his pantaloons as soon as possible.
He complied, and then proceeded to wash himself.
At that time in the morning any Christian would have washed his face; but Queequeg, to my amazement, contented himself with restricting his ablutions to his chest, arms, and hands.
He then donned his waistcoat, and taking up a piece of hard soap on the wash-stand centre table, dipped it into water and commenced lathering his face.
I was watching to see where he kept his razor, when lo and behold, he takes the harpoon from the bed corner, slips out the long wooden stock, unsheathes the head, whets it a little on his boot, and striding up to the bit of mirror against the wall, begins a vigorous scraping, or rather harpooning of his cheeks.
Thinks I, Queequeg, this is using Rogers's best cutlery with a vengeance.
Afterwards I wondered the less at this operation when I came to know of what fine steel the head of a harpoon is made, and how exceedingly sharp the long straight edges are always kept.
The rest of his toilet was soon achieved, and he proudly marched out of the room, wrapped up in his great pilot monkey jacket, and sporting his harpoon like a marshal's baton.
Chapter 5.
Breakfast.
I quickly followed suit, and descending into the bar-room accosted the grinning landlord very pleasantly.
I cherished no malice towards him, though he had been skylarking with me not a little in the matter of my bedfellow.
However, a good laugh is a mighty good thing, and rather too scarce a good thing; the more's the pity.
So, if any one man, in his own proper person, afford stuff for a good joke to anybody, let him not be backward, but let him cheerfully allow himself to spend and be spent in that way.
And the man that has anything bountifully laughable about him, be sure there is more in that man than you perhaps think for.
The bar-room was now full of the boarders who had been dropping in the night previous, and whom I had not as yet had a good look at.
They were nearly all whalemen; chief mates, and second mates, and third mates, and sea carpenters, and sea coopers, and sea blacksmiths, and harpooneers, and ship keepers; a brown and brawny company, with bosky beards; an unshorn, shaggy set, all wearing monkey jackets for morning gowns.
You could pretty plainly tell how long each one had been ashore.
This young fellow's healthy cheek is like a sun-toasted pear in hue, and would seem to smell almost as musky; he cannot have been three days landed from his Indian voyage.
That man next him looks a few shades lighter; you might say a touch of satin wood is in him.
In the complexion of a third still lingers a tropic tawn, but slightly bleached withal; HE doubtless has tarried whole weeks ashore.
But who could show a cheek like Queequeg? which, barred with various tints, seemed like the Andes' western slope, to show forth in one array, contrasting climates, zone by zone.
"Grub, ho!" now cried the landlord, flinging open a door, and in we went to breakfast.
They say that men who have seen the world, thereby become quite at ease in manner, quite self-possessed in company.
Not always, though:
Ledyard, the great New England traveller, and Mungo Park, the
Scotch one; of all men, they possessed the least assurance in the parlor.
But perhaps the mere crossing of Siberia in a sledge drawn by dogs as Ledyard did, or the taking a long solitary walk on an empty stomach, in the negro heart of Africa, which was the sum of poor Mungo's performances--this kind of travel, I say, may not be the very best mode of attaining a high social polish.
Still, for the most part, that sort of thing is to be had anywhere.
These reflections just here are occasioned by the circumstance that after we were all seated at the table, and I was preparing to hear some good stories about whaling; to my no small surprise, nearly every man maintained a profound silence.
And not only that, but they looked embarrassed.
Yes, here were a set of sea-dogs, many of whom without the slightest bashfulness had boarded great whales on the high seas-- entire strangers to them--and duelled them dead without winking; and yet, here they sat at a social breakfast table--all of the same calling, all of kindred tastes--
looking round as sheepishly at each other as though they had never been out of sight of some sheepfold among the Green Mountains.
A curious sight; these bashful bears, these timid warrior whalemen!
But as for Queequeg--why, Queequeg sat there among them--at the head of the table, too, it so chanced; as cool as an icicle. To be sure I cannot say much for his breeding.
His greatest admirer could not have cordially justified his bringing his harpoon into breakfast with him, and using it there without ceremony; reaching over the table with it, to the imminent jeopardy of many heads, and grappling the beefsteaks towards him.
But THAT was certainly very coolly done by him, and every one knows that in most people's estimation, to do anything coolly is to do it genteelly.
We will not speak of all Queequeg's peculiarities here; how he eschewed coffee and hot rolls, and applied his undivided attention to beefsteaks, done rare.
Enough, that when breakfast was over he withdrew like the rest into the public room, lighted his tomahawk-pipe, and was sitting there quietly digesting and smoking with his inseparable hat on, when I sallied out for a stroll.
Chapter 6.
The Street.
If I had been astonished at first catching a glimpse of so outlandish an individual as
Queequeg circulating among the polite society of a civilized town, that astonishment soon departed upon taking my first daylight stroll through the streets of New Bedford.
In thoroughfares nigh the docks, any considerable seaport will frequently offer to view the queerest looking nondescripts from foreign parts.
Even in Broadway and Chestnut streets, Mediterranean mariners will sometimes jostle the affrighted ladies.
Regent Street is not unknown to Lascars and Malays; and at Bombay, in the Apollo Green, live Yankees have often scared the natives.
But New Bedford beats all Water Street and
Wapping.
In these last-mentioned haunts you see only sailors; but in New Bedford, actual cannibals stand chatting at street corners; savages outright; many of whom yet carry on their bones unholy flesh.
It makes a stranger stare.
But, besides the Feegeeans, Tongatobooarrs, Erromanggoans, Pannangians, and
Brighggians, and, besides the wild specimens of the whaling-craft which unheeded reel about the streets, you will see other sights still more curious, certainly more comical.
There weekly arrive in this town scores of green Vermonters and New Hampshire men, all athirst for gain and glory in the fishery.
They are mostly young, of stalwart frames; fellows who have felled forests, and now seek to drop the axe and snatch the whale- lance.
Many are as green as the Green Mountains whence they came.
In some things you would think them but a few hours old.
Look there! that chap strutting round the corner.
He wears a beaver hat and swallow-tailed coat, girdled with a sailor-belt and sheath-knife.
Here comes another with a sou'-wester and a bombazine cloak.
No town-bred dandy will compare with a country-bred one--I mean a downright bumpkin dandy--a fellow that, in the dog- days, will mow his two acres in buckskin gloves for fear of tanning his hands.
Now when a country dandy like this takes it into his head to make a distinguished reputation, and joins the great whale- fishery, you should see the comical things he does upon reaching the seaport.
In bespeaking his sea-outfit, he orders bell-buttons to his waistcoats; straps to his canvas trowsers.
Ah, poor Hay-Seed! how bitterly will burst those straps in the first howling gale, when thou art driven, straps, buttons, and all, down the throat of the tempest.
But think not that this famous town has only harpooneers, cannibals, and bumpkins to show her visitors.
Not at all.
Still New Bedford is a queer place.
Had it not been for us whalemen, that tract of land would this day perhaps have been in as howling condition as the coast of Labrador.
As it is, parts of her back country are enough to frighten one, they look so bony.
The town itself is perhaps the dearest place to live in, in all New England.
It is a land of oil, true enough: but not like Canaan; a land, also, of corn and wine.
The streets do not run with milk; nor in the spring-time do they pave them with fresh eggs.
Yet, in spite of this, nowhere in all America will you find more patrician-like houses; parks and gardens more opulent, than in New Bedford.
Whence came they? how planted upon this once scraggy scoria of a country?
Go and gaze upon the iron emblematical harpoons round yonder lofty mansion, and your question will be answered.
Yes; all these brave houses and flowery gardens came from the Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian oceans.
One and all, they were harpooned and dragged up hither from the bottom of the sea.
Can Herr Alexander perform a feat like that?
In New Bedford, fathers, they say, give whales for dowers to their daughters, and portion off their nieces with a few porpoises a-piece.
You must go to New Bedford to see a brilliant wedding; for, they say, they have reservoirs of oil in every house, and every night recklessly burn their lengths in spermaceti candles.
In summer time, the town is sweet to see; full of fine maples--long avenues of green and gold.
And in August, high in air, the beautiful and bountiful horse-chestnuts, candelabra- wise, proffer the passer-by their tapering upright cones of congregated blossoms.
So omnipotent is art; which in many a district of New Bedford has superinduced bright terraces of flowers upon the barren refuse rocks thrown aside at creation's final day.
And the women of New Bedford, they bloom like their own red roses.
But roses only bloom in summer; whereas the fine carnation of their cheeks is perennial as sunlight in the seventh heavens.
Elsewhere match that bloom of theirs, ye cannot, save in Salem, where they tell me the young girls breathe such musk, their sailor sweethearts smell them miles off shore, as though they were drawing nigh the odorous Moluccas instead of the Puritanic sands.
Chapter 7.
The Chapel.
In this same New Bedford there stands a Whaleman's Chapel, and few are the moody fishermen, shortly bound for the Indian Ocean or Pacific, who fail to make a Sunday visit to the spot.
I am sure that I did not.
Returning from my first morning stroll, I again sallied out upon this special errand.
The sky had changed from clear, sunny cold, to driving sleet and mist.
Wrapping myself in my shaggy jacket of the cloth called bearskin, I fought my way against the stubborn storm.
Entering, I found a small scattered congregation of sailors, and sailors' wives and widows.
A muffled silence reigned, only broken at times by the shrieks of the storm.
Each silent worshipper seemed purposely sitting apart from the other, as if each silent grief were insular and incommunicable.
The chaplain had not yet arrived; and there these silent islands of men and women sat steadfastly eyeing several marble tablets, with black borders, masoned into the wall on either side the pulpit.
Three of them ran something like the following, but I do not pretend to quote:--
SACRED TO THE MEMORY OF JOHN TALBOT, Who, at the age of eighteen, was lost overboard,
Near the Isle of Desolation, off Patagonia, November 1st, 1836.
THlS TABLET Is erected to his Memory BY HlS SlSTER.
SACRED TO THE MEMORY OF ROBERT LONG, WlLLlS ELLERY, NATHAN COLEMAN, WALTER CANNY, SETH
MACY, AND SAMUEL GLElG, Forming one of the boats' crews OF THE SHlP ELlZA Who were towed out of sight by a Whale, On the Off- shore Ground in the PAClFIC, December 31st, 1839.
THlS MARBLE Is here placed by their surviving SHlPMATES.
SACRED TO THE MEMORY OF The late CAPTAlN EZEKlEL HARDY, Who in the bows of his boat was killed by a Sperm Whale on the coast of Japan, AUGUST 3d, 1833.
THlS TABLET Is erected to his Memory BY HlS WlDOW.
Shaking off the sleet from my ice-glazed hat and jacket, I seated myself near the door, and turning sideways was surprised to see Queequeg near me.
Affected by the solemnity of the scene, there was a wondering gaze of incredulous curiosity in his countenance.
This savage was the only person present who seemed to notice my entrance; because he was the only one who could not read, and, therefore, was not reading those frigid inscriptions on the wall.
Whether any of the relatives of the seamen whose names appeared there were now among the congregation, I knew not; but so many are the unrecorded accidents in the fishery, and so plainly did several women present wear the countenance if not the trappings of some unceasing grief, that I feel sure that here before me were assembled those, in whose unhealing hearts the sight of those bleak tablets sympathetically caused the old wounds to bleed afresh.
Oh! ye whose dead lie buried beneath the green grass; who standing among flowers can say--here, HERE lies my beloved; ye know not the desolation that broods in bosoms like these.
What bitter blanks in those black-bordered marbles which cover no ashes!
What despair in those immovable inscriptions!
What deadly voids and unbidden infidelities in the lines that seem to gnaw upon all
Faith, and refuse resurrections to the beings who have placelessly perished without a grave.
As well might those tablets stand in the cave of Elephanta as here.
In what census of living creatures, the dead of mankind are included; why it is that a universal proverb says of them, that they tell no tales, though containing more secrets than the Goodwin Sands; how it is that to his name who yesterday departed for the other world, we prefix so significant and infidel a word, and yet do not thus entitle him, if he but embarks for the remotest Indies of this living earth; why the Life Insurance Companies pay death- forfeitures upon immortals; in what eternal, unstirring paralysis, and deadly, hopeless trance, yet lies antique Adam who died sixty round centuries ago; how it is that we still refuse to be comforted for those who we nevertheless maintain are dwelling in unspeakable bliss; why all the living so strive to hush all the dead; wherefore but the rumor of a knocking in a tomb will terrify a whole city.
All these things are not without their meanings.
But Faith, like a jackal, feeds among the tombs, and even from these dead doubts she gathers her most vital hope.
It needs scarcely to be told, with what feelings, on the eve of a Nantucket voyage,
I regarded those marble tablets, and by the murky light of that darkened, doleful day read the fate of the whalemen who had gone before me.
Yes, Ishmael, the same fate may be thine.
But somehow I grew merry again.
Delightful inducements to embark, fine chance for promotion, it seems--aye, a stove boat will make me an immortal by brevet.
Yes, there is death in this business of whaling--a speechlessly quick chaotic bundling of a man into Eternity.
But what then?
Methinks we have hugely mistaken this matter of Life and Death.
Methinks that what they call my shadow here on earth is my true substance.
Methinks that in looking at things spiritual, we are too much like oysters observing the sun through the water, and thinking that thick water the thinnest of air.
Methinks my body is but the lees of my better being.
In fact take my body who will, take it I say, it is not me.
And therefore three cheers for Nantucket; and come a stove boat and stove body when they will, for stave my soul, Jove himself cannot. &gt;
-Chapter 8.
The Pulpit.
I had not been seated very long ere a man of a certain venerable robustness entered; immediately as the storm-pelted door flew back upon admitting him, a quick regardful eyeing of him by all the congregation, sufficiently attested that this fine old man was the chaplain.
Yes, it was the famous Father Mapple, so called by the whalemen, among whom he was a very great favourite.
He had been a sailor and a harpooneer in his youth, but for many years past had dedicated his life to the ministry.
At the time I now write of, Father Mapple was in the hardy winter of a healthy old age; that sort of old age which seems merging into a second flowering youth, for among all the fissures of his wrinkles, there shone certain mild gleams of a newly developing bloom--the spring verdure peeping forth even beneath February's snow.
No one having previously heard his history, could for the first time behold Father
Mapple without the utmost interest, because there were certain engrafted clerical peculiarities about him, imputable to that adventurous maritime life he had led.
When he entered I observed that he carried no umbrella, and certainly had not come in his carriage, for his tarpaulin hat ran down with melting sleet, and his great pilot cloth jacket seemed almost to drag him to the floor with the weight of the water it had absorbed.
However, hat and coat and overshoes were one by one removed, and hung up in a little space in an adjacent corner; when, arrayed in a decent suit, he quietly approached the pulpit.
Like most old fashioned pulpits, it was a very lofty one, and since a regular stairs to such a height would, by its long angle with the floor, seriously contract the already small area of the chapel, the architect, it seemed, had acted upon the hint of Father Mapple, and finished the pulpit without a stairs, substituting a perpendicular side ladder, like those used in mounting a ship from a boat at sea.
The wife of a whaling captain had provided the chapel with a handsome pair of red worsted man-ropes for this ladder, which, being itself nicely headed, and stained with a mahogany colour, the whole contrivance, considering what manner of chapel it was, seemed by no means in bad taste.
Halting for an instant at the foot of the ladder, and with both hands grasping the ornamental knobs of the man-ropes, Father Mapple cast a look upwards, and then with a truly sailor-like but still reverential dexterity, hand over hand, mounted the steps as if ascending the main-top of his vessel.
The perpendicular parts of this side ladder, as is usually the case with swinging ones, were of cloth-covered rope, only the rounds were of wood, so that at every step there was a joint.
At my first glimpse of the pulpit, it had not escaped me that however convenient for a ship, these joints in the present instance seemed unnecessary.
For I was not prepared to see Father Mapple after gaining the height, slowly turn round, and stooping over the pulpit, deliberately drag up the ladder step by step, till the whole was deposited within,
leaving him impregnable in his little Quebec.
I pondered some time without fully comprehending the reason for this.
Father Mapple enjoyed such a wide reputation for sincerity and sanctity, that
I could not suspect him of courting notoriety by any mere tricks of the stage.
No, thought I, there must be some sober reason for this thing; furthermore, it must symbolize something unseen.
Can it be, then, that by that act of physical isolation, he signifies his spiritual withdrawal for the time, from all outward worldly ties and connexions?
Yes, for replenished with the meat and wine of the word, to the faithful man of God, this pulpit, I see, is a self-containing stronghold--a lofty Ehrenbreitstein, with a perennial well of water within the walls.
But the side ladder was not the only strange feature of the place, borrowed from the chaplain's former sea-farings.
Between the marble cenotaphs on either hand of the pulpit, the wall which formed its back was adorned with a large painting representing a gallant ship beating against a terrible storm off a lee coast of black rocks and snowy breakers.
But high above the flying scud and dark- rolling clouds, there floated a little isle of sunlight, from which beamed forth an angel's face; and this bright face shed a distinct spot of radiance upon the ship's tossed deck, something like that silver plate now inserted into the Victory's plank where Nelson fell.
"Ah, noble ship," the angel seemed to say, "beat on, beat on, thou noble ship, and bear a hardy helm; for lo! the sun is breaking through; the clouds are rolling off--serenest azure is at hand."
Nor was the pulpit itself without a trace of the same sea-taste that had achieved the ladder and the picture.
Its panelled front was in the likeness of a ship's bluff bows, and the Holy Bible rested on a projecting piece of scroll work, fashioned after a ship's fiddle- headed beak.
What could be more full of meaning?--for the pulpit is ever this earth's foremost part; all the rest comes in its rear; the pulpit leads the world.
From thence it is the storm of God's quick wrath is first descried, and the bow must bear the earliest brunt.
From thence it is the God of breezes fair or foul is first invoked for favourable winds.
Yes, the world's a ship on its passage out, and not a voyage complete; and the pulpit is its prow.
Chapter 9.
The Sermon.
Father Mapple rose, and in a mild voice of unassuming authority ordered the scattered people to condense.
"Starboard gangway, there! side away to larboard--larboard gangway to starboard!
Midships! midships!"
There was a low rumbling of heavy sea-boots among the benches, and a still slighter shuffling of women's shoes, and all was quiet again, and every eye on the preacher.
He paused a little; then kneeling in the pulpit's bows, folded his large brown hands across his chest, uplifted his closed eyes, and offered a prayer so deeply devout that he seemed kneeling and praying at the bottom of the sea.
This ended, in prolonged solemn tones, like the continual tolling of a bell in a ship that is foundering at sea in a fog--in such tones he commenced reading the following hymn; but changing his manner towards the concluding stanzas, burst forth with a pealing exultation and joy--
"The ribs and terrors in the whale, Arched over me a dismal gloom,
While all God's sun-lit waves rolled by, And lift me deepening down to doom.
"I saw the opening maw of hell, With endless pains and sorrows there;
Which none but they that feel can tell-- Oh, I was plunging to despair.
"In black distress, I called my God, When I could scarce believe him mine,
He bowed his ear to my complaints-- No more the whale did me confine.
"With speed he flew to my relief, As on a radiant dolphin borne;
Awful, yet bright, as lightning shone The face of my Deliverer God.
"My song for ever shall record That terrible, that joyful hour;
I give the glory to my God, His all the mercy and the power."
Nearly all joined in singing this hymn, which swelled high above the howling of the storm.
A brief pause ensued; the preacher slowly turned over the leaves of the Bible, and at last, folding his hand down upon the proper page, said: "Beloved shipmates, clinch the
'And God had prepared a great fish to swallow up Jonah.'"
"Shipmates, this book, containing only four chapters--four yarns--is one of the smallest strands in the mighty cable of the Scriptures.
Yet what depths of the soul does Jonah's deep sealine sound! what a pregnant lesson to us is this prophet!
What a noble thing is that canticle in the fish's belly!
How billow-like and boisterously grand!
We feel the floods surging over us; we sound with him to the kelpy bottom of the waters; sea-weed and all the slime of the sea is about us!
But WHAT is this lesson that the book of Jonah teaches?
Shipmates, it is a two-stranded lesson; a lesson to us all as sinful men, and a lesson to me as a pilot of the living God.
As sinful men, it is a lesson to us all, because it is a story of the sin, hard- heartedness, suddenly awakened fears, the swift punishment, repentance, prayers, and finally the deliverance and joy of Jonah.
As with all sinners among men, the sin of this son of Amittai was in his wilful disobedience of the command of God--never mind now what that command was, or how conveyed--which he found a hard command.
But all the things that God would have us do are hard for us to do--remember that-- and hence, he oftener commands us than endeavors to persuade.
And if we obey God, we must disobey ourselves; and it is in this disobeying ourselves, wherein the hardness of obeying God consists.
"With this sin of disobedience in him, Jonah still further flouts at God, by seeking to flee from Him.
He thinks that a ship made by men will carry him into countries where God does not reign, but only the Captains of this earth.
He skulks about the wharves of Joppa, and seeks a ship that's bound for Tarshish.
There lurks, perhaps, a hitherto unheeded meaning here.
By all accounts Tarshish could have been no other city than the modern Cadiz.
That's the opinion of learned men.
And where is Cadiz, shipmates?
Cadiz is in Spain; as far by water, from
Joppa, as Jonah could possibly have sailed in those ancient days, when the Atlantic was an almost unknown sea.
Because Joppa, the modern Jaffa, shipmates, is on the most easterly coast of the
Mediterranean, the Syrian; and Tarshish or Cadiz more than two thousand miles to the westward from that, just outside the Straits of Gibraltar.
See ye not then, shipmates, that Jonah sought to flee world-wide from God?
Miserable man!
Oh! most contemptible and worthy of all scorn; with slouched hat and guilty eye, skulking from his God; prowling among the shipping like a vile burglar hastening to cross the seas.
So disordered, self-condemning is his look, that had there been policemen in those days, Jonah, on the mere suspicion of something wrong, had been arrested ere he touched a deck.
How plainly he's a fugitive! no baggage, not a hat-box, valise, or carpet-bag,--no friends accompany him to the wharf with their adieux.
At last, after much dodging search, he finds the Tarshish ship receiving the last items of her cargo; and as he steps on board to see its Captain in the cabin, all the sailors for the moment desist from hoisting in the goods, to mark the stranger's evil eye.
Jonah sees this; but in vain he tries to look all ease and confidence; in vain essays his wretched smile.
Strong intuitions of the man assure the mariners he can be no innocent.
In their gamesome but still serious way, one whispers to the other--"Jack, he's robbed a widow;" or, "Joe, do you mark him; he's a bigamist;" or, "Harry lad, I guess he's the adulterer that broke jail in old
Gomorrah, or belike, one of the missing murderers from Sodom."
Another runs to read the bill that's stuck against the spile upon the wharf to which the ship is moored, offering five hundred gold coins for the apprehension of a parricide, and containing a description of his person.
He reads, and looks from Jonah to the bill; while all his sympathetic shipmates now crowd round Jonah, prepared to lay their hands upon him.
Frighted Jonah trembles, and summoning all his boldness to his face, only looks so much the more a coward.
He will not confess himself suspected; but that itself is strong suspicion.
So he makes the best of it; and when the sailors find him not to be the man that is advertised, they let him pass, and he descends into the cabin. "'Who's there?' cries the Captain at his busy desk, hurriedly making out his papers for the Customs--'Who's there?'
Jonah!
For the instant he almost turns to flee again.
'I seek a passage in this ship to Tarshish; how soon sail ye, sir?'
Thus far the busy Captain had not looked up to Jonah, though the man now stands before him; but no sooner does he hear that hollow voice, than he darts a scrutinizing glance.
'We sail with the next coming tide,' at last he slowly answered, still intently eyeing him.
'No sooner, sir?'--'Soon enough for any honest man that goes a passenger.'
Ha!
Jonah, that's another stab.
But he swiftly calls away the Captain from that scent.
'I'll sail with ye,'--he says,--'the passage money how much is that?--I'll pay now.'
For it is particularly written, shipmates, as if it were a thing not to be overlooked in this history, 'that he paid the fare thereof' ere the craft did sail.
And taken with the context, this is full of meaning.
"Now Jonah's Captain, shipmates, was one whose discernment detects crime in any, but whose cupidity exposes it only in the penniless.
In this world, shipmates, sin that pays its way can travel freely, and without a passport; whereas Virtue, if a pauper, is stopped at all frontiers.
So Jonah's Captain prepares to test the length of Jonah's purse, ere he judge him openly.
He charges him thrice the usual sum; and it's assented to.
Then the Captain knows that Jonah is a fugitive; but at the same time resolves to help a flight that paves its rear with gold.
Yet when Jonah fairly takes out his purse, prudent suspicions still molest the
Captain.
He rings every coin to find a counterfeit.
Not a forger, any way, he mutters; and Jonah is put down for his passage.
'Point out my state-room, Sir,' says Jonah now, 'I'm travel-weary; I need sleep.'
'Thou lookest like it,' says the Captain, 'there's thy room.'
Jonah enters, and would lock the door, but the lock contains no key.
Hearing him foolishly fumbling there, the Captain laughs lowly to himself, and mutters something about the doors of convicts' cells being never allowed to be locked within.
All dressed and dusty as he is, Jonah throws himself into his berth, and finds the little state-room ceiling almost resting on his forehead.
The air is close, and Jonah gasps.
Then, in that contracted hole, sunk, too, beneath the ship's water-line, Jonah feels the heralding presentiment of that stifling hour, when the whale shall hold him in the smallest of his bowels' wards.
"Screwed at its axis against the side, a swinging lamp slightly oscillates in
Jonah's room; and the ship, heeling over towards the wharf with the weight of the
last bales received, the lamp, flame and all, though in slight motion, still maintains a permanent obliquity with reference to the room; though, in truth, infallibly straight itself, it but made obvious the false, lying levels among which it hung.
The lamp alarms and frightens Jonah; as lying in his berth his tormented eyes roll round the place, and this thus far successful fugitive finds no refuge for his restless glance.
But that contradiction in the lamp more and more appals him.
The floor, the ceiling, and the side, are all awry.
'Oh! so my conscience hangs in me!' he groans, 'straight upwards, so it burns; but the chambers of my soul are all in crookedness!'
"Like one who after a night of drunken revelry hies to his bed, still reeling, but with conscience yet pricking him, as the plungings of the Roman race-horse but so much the more strike his steel tags into him; as one who in that miserable plight still turns and turns in giddy anguish, praying God for annihilation until the fit be passed; and at last amid the whirl of woe he feels, a deep stupor steals over him, as over the man who bleeds to death, for conscience is the wound, and there's naught to staunch it; so, after sore wrestlings in his berth, Jonah's prodigy of ponderous misery drags him drowning down to sleep.
"And now the time of tide has come; the ship casts off her cables; and from the deserted wharf the uncheered ship for Tarshish, all careening, glides to sea.
That ship, my friends, was the first of recorded smugglers! the contraband was
Jonah.
But the sea rebels; he will not bear the wicked burden.
A dreadful storm comes on, the ship is like to break.
But now when the boatswain calls all hands to lighten her; when boxes, bales, and jars are clattering overboard; when the wind is shrieking, and the men are yelling, and every plank thunders with trampling feet right over Jonah's head; in all this raging tumult, Jonah sleeps his hideous sleep.
He sees no black sky and raging sea, feels not the reeling timbers, and little hears he or heeds he the far rush of the mighty whale, which even now with open mouth is cleaving the seas after him.
Aye, shipmates, Jonah was gone down into the sides of the ship--a berth in the cabin as I have taken it, and was fast asleep.
But the frightened master comes to him, and shrieks in his dead ear, 'What meanest thou, O, sleeper! arise!'
Startled from his lethargy by that direful cry, Jonah staggers to his feet, and stumbling to the deck, grasps a shroud, to look out upon the sea.
But at that moment he is sprung upon by a panther billow leaping over the bulwarks.
Wave after wave thus leaps into the ship, and finding no speedy vent runs roaring fore and aft, till the mariners come nigh to drowning while yet afloat.
And ever, as the white moon shows her affrighted face from the steep gullies in the blackness overhead, aghast Jonah sees the rearing bowsprit pointing high upward, but soon beat downward again towards the tormented deep.
"Terrors upon terrors run shouting through his soul.
In all his cringing attitudes, the God- fugitive is now too plainly known.
The sailors mark him; more and more certain grow their suspicions of him, and at last, fully to test the truth, by referring the whole matter to high Heaven, they fall to casting lots, to see for whose cause this great tempest was upon them.
The lot is Jonah's; that discovered, then how furiously they mob him with their questions.
'What is thine occupation?
Whence comest thou?
Thy country?
What people?
But mark now, my shipmates, the behavior of poor Jonah.
The eager mariners but ask him who he is, and where from; whereas, they not only receive an answer to those questions, but likewise another answer to a question not put by them, but the unsolicited answer is forced from Jonah by the hard hand of God that is upon him. "'I am a Hebrew,' he cries--and then--'I fear the Lord the God of Heaven who hath made the sea and the dry land!'
Fear him, O Jonah?
Aye, well mightest thou fear the Lord God
THEN!
Straightway, he now goes on to make a full confession; whereupon the mariners became more and more appalled, but still are pitiful.
For when Jonah, not yet supplicating God for mercy, since he but too well knew the darkness of his deserts,--when wretched Jonah cries out to them to take him and cast him forth into the sea, for he knew that for HlS sake this great tempest was upon them; they mercifully turn from him, and seek by other means to save the ship.
But all in vain; the indignant gale howls louder; then, with one hand raised invokingly to God, with the other they not unreluctantly lay hold of Jonah.
"And now behold Jonah taken up as an anchor and dropped into the sea; when instantly an oily calmness floats out from the east, and the sea is still, as Jonah carries down the gale with him, leaving smooth water behind.
He goes down in the whirling heart of such a masterless commotion that he scarce heeds the moment when he drops seething into the yawning jaws awaiting him; and the whale shoots-to all his ivory teeth, like so many white bolts, upon his prison.
Then Jonah prayed unto the Lord out of the fish's belly.
But observe his prayer, and learn a weighty lesson.
For sinful as he is, Jonah does not weep and wail for direct deliverance.
He feels that his dreadful punishment is just.
He leaves all his deliverance to God, contenting himself with this, that spite of all his pains and pangs, he will still look towards His holy temple.
And here, shipmates, is true and faithful repentance; not clamorous for pardon, but grateful for punishment.
And how pleasing to God was this conduct in Jonah, is shown in the eventual deliverance of him from the sea and the whale.
Shipmates, I do not place Jonah before you to be copied for his sin but I do place him before you as a model for repentance.
Sin not; but if you do, take heed to repent of it like Jonah."
While he was speaking these words, the howling of the shrieking, slanting storm without seemed to add new power to the preacher, who, when describing Jonah's sea- storm, seemed tossed by a storm himself.
His deep chest heaved as with a ground- swell; his tossed arms seemed the warring elements at work; and the thunders that rolled away from off his swarthy brow, and the light leaping from his eye, made all his simple hearers look on him with a quick fear that was strange to them.
There now came a lull in his look, as he silently turned over the leaves of the Book once more; and, at last, standing motionless, with closed eyes, for the moment, seemed communing with God and himself.
But again he leaned over towards the people, and bowing his head lowly, with an aspect of the deepest yet manliest humility, he spake these words:
"Shipmates, God has laid but one hand upon you; both his hands press upon me.
I have read ye by what murky light may be mine the lesson that Jonah teaches to all sinners; and therefore to ye, and still more to me, for I am a greater sinner than ye.
And now how gladly would I come down from this mast-head and sit on the hatches there where you sit, and listen as you listen, while some one of you reads ME that other and more awful lesson which Jonah teaches to ME, as a pilot of the living God.
How being an anointed pilot-prophet, or speaker of true things, and bidden by the
Lord to sound those unwelcome truths in the ears of a wicked Nineveh, Jonah, appalled at the hostility he should raise, fled from his mission, and sought to escape his duty and his God by taking ship at Joppa.
But God is everywhere; Tarshish he never reached.
As we have seen, God came upon him in the whale, and swallowed him down to living gulfs of doom, and with swift slantings tore him along 'into the midst of the seas,' where the eddying depths sucked him ten thousand fathoms down, and 'the weeds were wrapped about his head,' and all the watery world of woe bowled over him.
Yet even then beyond the reach of any plummet--'out of the belly of hell'--when the whale grounded upon the ocean's utmost bones, even then, God heard the engulphed, repenting prophet when he cried.
Then God spake unto the fish; and from the shuddering cold and blackness of the sea, the whale came breeching up towards the warm and pleasant sun, and all the delights of air and earth; and 'vomited out Jonah upon the dry land;' when the word of the Lord came a second time; and Jonah, bruised and beaten--his ears, like two sea-shells, still multitudinously murmuring of the ocean--Jonah did the Almighty's bidding.
And what was that, shipmates?
To preach the Truth to the face of
Falsehood!
That was it!
"This, shipmates, this is that other lesson; and woe to that pilot of the living
God who slights it.
Woe to him whom this world charms from
Gospel duty!
Woe to him who seeks to pour oil upon the waters when God has brewed them into a gale!
Woe to him who seeks to please rather than to appal!
Woe to him whose good name is more to him than goodness!
Woe to him who, in this world, courts not dishonour!
Woe to him who would not be true, even though to be false were salvation!
Yea, woe to him who, as the great Pilot Paul has it, while preaching to others is himself a castaway!"
He dropped and fell away from himself for a moment; then lifting his face to them again, showed a deep joy in his eyes, as he cried out with a heavenly enthusiasm,--"But oh! shipmates! on the starboard hand of every woe, there is a sure delight; and higher the top of that delight, than the bottom of the woe is deep.
Is not the main-truck higher than the kelson is low?
Delight is to him--a far, far upward, and inward delight--who against the proud gods and commodores of this earth, ever stands forth his own inexorable self.
Delight is to him whose strong arms yet support him, when the ship of this base treacherous world has gone down beneath him.
Delight is to him, who gives no quarter in the truth, and kills, burns, and destroys all sin though he pluck it out from under the robes of Senators and Judges.
Delight,--top-gallant delight is to him, who acknowledges no law or lord, but the
Lord his God, and is only a patriot to heaven.
Delight is to him, whom all the waves of the billows of the seas of the boisterous mob can never shake from this sure Keel of the Ages.
And eternal delight and deliciousness will be his, who coming to lay him down, can say with his final breath--O Father!--chiefly known to me by Thy rod--mortal or immortal, here I die.
I have striven to be Thine, more than to be this world's, or mine own.
I leave eternity to Thee; for what is man that he should live out the lifetime of his God?"
He said no more, but slowly waving a benediction, covered his face with his hands, and so remained kneeling, till all the people had departed, and he was left alone in the place. &gt;
When I was nine years old,
I went off to summer camp for the first time.
And my mother packed me a suitcase full of books, which to me seemed like a perfectly natural thing to do.
Because in my family, reading was the primary group activity.
And this might sound antisocial to you, but for us it was really just a different way of being social.
You have the animal warmth of your family sitting right next to you, but you are also free to go roaming around the adventureland inside your own mind.
And I had this idea that camp was going to be just like this, but better.
(Laughter)
I had a vision of 10 girls sitting in a cabin cozily reading books in their matching nightgowns.
(Laughter)
Camp was more like a keg party without any alcohol.
And on the very first day, our counselor gathered us all together and she taught us a cheer that she said we would be doing every day for the rest of the summer to instill camp spirit.
And it went like this:
"R-O-W-D-I-E, that's the way we spell rowdie.
Rowdie, rowdie, let's get rowdie."
Yeah.
So I couldn't figure out for the life of me why we were supposed to be so rowdy, or why we had to spell this word incorrectly.
(Laughter)
But I recited a cheer.
I recited a cheer along with everybody else.
I did my best.
And I just waited for the time that I could go off and read my books.
But the first time that I took my book out of my suitcase, the coolest girl in the bunk came up to me and she asked me, "Why are you being so mellow?" -- mellow, of course, being the exact opposite of R-O-W-D-I-E.
And then the second time I tried it, the counselor came up to me with a concerned expression on her face and she repeated the point about camp spirit and said we should all work very hard to be outgoing.
And so I put my books away, back in their suitcase, and I put them under my bed, and there they stayed for the rest of the summer.
And I felt kind of guilty about this.
I felt as if the books needed me somehow, and they were calling out to me and I was forsaking them.
But I did forsake them and I didn't open that suitcase again until I was back home with my family at the end of the summer.
Now, I tell you this story about summer camp.
I could have told you 50 others just like it -- all the times that I got the message that somehow my quiet and introverted style of being was not necessarily the right way to go, that I should be trying to pass as more of an extrovert.
And I always sensed deep down that this was wrong and that introverts were pretty excellent just as they were.
But for years I denied this intuition, and so I became a Wall Street lawyer, of all things, instead of the writer that I had always longed to be -- partly because I needed to prove to myself that I could be bold and assertive too.
And I was always going off to crowded bars when I really would have preferred to just have a nice dinner with friends.
And I made these self-negating choices so reflexively, that I wasn't even aware that I was making them.
Now this is what many introverts do, and it's our loss for sure, but it is also our colleagues' loss and our communities' loss.
And at the risk of sounding grandiose, it is the world's loss.
Because when it comes to creativity and to leadership, we need introverts doing what they do best.
A third to a half of the population are introverts -- a third to a half.
So that's one out of every two or three people you know.
So even if you're an extrovert yourself, I'm talking about your coworkers and your spouses and your children and the person sitting next to you right now -- all of them subject to this bias that is pretty deep and real in our society.
We all internalize it from a very early age without even having a language for what we're doing.
Now, to see the bias clearly, you need to understand what introversion is.
It's different from being shy.
Shyness is about fear of social judgment.
Introversion is more about, how do you respond to stimulation, including social stimulation.
So extroverts really crave large amounts of stimulation, whereas introverts feel at their most alive and their most switched-on and their most capable when they're in quieter, more low-key environments.
Not all the time -- these things aren't absolute -- but a lot of the time.
So the key then to maximizing our talents is for us all to put ourselves in the zone of stimulation that is right for us.
But now here's where the bias comes in.
Our most important institutions, our schools and our workplaces, they are designed mostly for extroverts and for extroverts' need for lots of stimulation.
And also we have this belief system right now that I call the new groupthink, which holds that all creativity and all productivity comes from a very oddly gregarious place.
So if you picture the typical classroom nowadays:
When I was going to school, we sat in rows.
We sat in rows of desks like this, and we did most of our work pretty autonomously.
But nowadays, your typical classroom has pods of desks -- four or five or six or seven kids all facing each other.
And kids are working in countless group assignments.
Even in subjects like math and creative writing, which you think would depend on solo flights of thought, kids are now expected to act as committee members.
And for the kids who prefer to go off by themselves or just to work alone, those kids are seen as outliers often or, worse, as problem cases.
And the vast majority of teachers reports believing that the ideal student is an extrovert as opposed to an introvert, even though introverts actually get better grades and are more knowledgeable, according to research.
(Laughter)
Okay, same thing is true in our workplaces.
Now, most of us work in open plan offices, without walls, where we are subject to the constant noise and gaze of our coworkers.
And when it comes to leadership, introverts are routinely passed over for leadership positions, even though introverts tend to be very careful, much less likely to take outsize risks -- which is something we might all favor nowadays.
And interesting research by Adam Grant at the Wharton School has found that introverted leaders often deliver better outcomes than extroverts do, because when they are managing proactive employees, they're much more likely to let those employees run with their ideas, whereas an extrovert can, quite unwittingly, get so excited about things that they're putting their own stamp on things, and other people's ideas might not as easily then bubble up to the surface.
Now in fact, some of our transformative leaders in history have been introverts.
I'll give you some examples.
Eleanor Roosevelt, Rosa Parks, Gandhi -- all these peopled described themselves as quiet and soft-spoken and even shy.
And they all took the spotlight, even though every bone in their bodies was telling them not to.
And this turns out to have a special power all its own, because people could feel that these leaders were at the helm not because they enjoyed directing others and not out of the pleasure of being looked at; they were there because they had no choice, because they were driven to do what they thought was right.
Now I think at this point it's important for me to say that I actually love extroverts.
I always like to say some of my best friends are extroverts, including my beloved husband.
And we all fall at different points, of course, along the introvert/extrovert spectrum.
Even Carl Jung, the psychologist who first popularized these terms, said that there's no such thing as a pure introvert or a pure extrovert.
He said that such a man would be in a lunatic asylum, if he existed at all.
And some people fall smack in the middle of the introvert/extrovert spectrum, and we call these people ambiverts.
And I often think that they have the best of all worlds.
But many of us do recognize ourselves as one type or the other.
And what I'm saying is that culturally, we need a much better balance.
We need more of a yin and yang between these two types.
This is especially important when it comes to creativity and to productivity, because when psychologists look at the lives of the most creative people, what they find are people who are very good at exchanging ideas and advancing ideas, but who also have a serious streak of introversion in them.
And this is because solitude is a crucial ingredient often to creativity.
So Darwin, he took long walks alone in the woods and emphatically turned down dinner-party invitations.
Theodor Geisel, better known as Dr. Seuss, he dreamed up many of his amazing creations in a lonely bell tower office that he had in the back of his house in La Jolla, California.
And he was actually afraid to meet the young children who read his books for fear that they were expecting him this kind of jolly Santa Claus-like figure and would be disappointed with his more reserved persona.
Steve Wozniak invented the first Apple computer sitting alone in his cubicle in Hewlett-Packard where he was working at the time.
And he says that he never would have become such an expert in the first place had he not been too introverted to leave the house when he was growing up.
Now, of course, this does not mean that we should all stop collaborating -- and case in point, is Steve Wozniak famously coming together with Steve Jobs to start Apple Computer -- but it does mean that solitude matters and that for some people it is the air that they breathe.
And in fact, we have known for centuries about the transcendent power of solitude.
It's only recently that we've strangely begun to forget it.
If you look at most of the world's major religions, you will find seekers --
Moses, Jesus, Buddha, Muhammad -- seekers who are going off by themselves alone to the wilderness, where they then have profound epiphanies and revelations that they then bring back to the rest of the community.
So, no wilderness, no revelations.
This is no surprise, though, if you look at the insights of contemporary psychology.
It turns out that we can't even be in a group of people without instinctively mirroring, mimicking their opinions.
Even about seemingly personal and visceral things like who you're attracted to, you will start aping the beliefs of the people around you without even realizing that that's what you're doing.
And groups famously follow the opinions of the most dominant or charismatic person in the room, even though there's zero correlation between being the best talker and having the best ideas --
I mean zero.
So -- (Laughter)
You might be following the person with the best ideas, but you might not.
And do you really want to leave it up to chance?
Much better for everybody to go off by themselves, generate their own ideas freed from the distortions of group dynamics, and then come together as a team to talk them through in a well-managed environment and take it from there.
Now if all this is true, then why are we getting it so wrong?
Why are we setting up our schools this way, and our workplaces?
And why are we making these introverts feel so guilty about wanting to just go off by themselves some of the time?
One answer lies deep in our cultural history.
Western societies, and in particular the U.S., have always favored the man of action over the "man" of contemplation.
But in America's early days, we lived in what historians call a culture of character, where we still, at that point, valued people for their inner selves and their moral rectitude.
And if you look at the self-help books from this era, they all had titles with things like
"Character, the Grandest Thing in the World."
And they featured role models like Abraham Lincoln, who was praised for being modest and unassuming.
Ralph Waldo Emerson called him
"A man who does not offend by superiority."
But then we hit the 20th century, and we entered a new culture that historians call the culture of personality.
What happened is we had evolved an agricultural economy to a world of big business.
And so suddenly people are moving from small towns to the cities.
And instead of working alongside people they've known all their lives, now they are having to prove themselves in a crowd of strangers.
So, quite understandably, qualities like magnetism and charisma suddenly come to seem really important.
And sure enough, the self-help books change to meet these new needs and they start to have names like "How to Win Friends and Influence People."
And they feature as their role models really great salesmen.
So that's the world we're living in today.
That's our cultural inheritance.
Now none of this is to say that social skills are unimportant, and I'm also not calling for the abolishing of teamwork at all.
The same religions who send their sages off to lonely mountain tops also teach us love and trust.
And the problems that we are facing today in fields like science and in economics are so vast and so complex that we are going to need armies of people coming together to solve them working together.
But I am saying that the more freedom that we give introverts to be themselves, the more likely that they are to come up with their own unique solutions to these problems.
So now I'd like to share with you what's in my suitcase today.
Guess what?
Books.
I have a suitcase full of books.
Here's Margaret Atwood, "Cat's Eye."
Here's a novel by Milan Kundera.
And here's "The Guide for the Perplexed" by Maimonides.
But these are not exactly my books.
I brought these books with me because they were written by my grandfather's favorite authors.
My grandfather was a rabbi and he was a widower who lived alone in a small apartment in Brooklyn that was my favorite place in the world when I was growing up, partly because it was filled with his very gentle, very courtly presence and partly because it was filled with books.
I mean literally every table, every chair in this apartment had yielded its original function to now serve as a surface for swaying stacks of books.
Just like the rest of my family, my grandfather's favorite thing to do in the whole world was to read.
But he also loved his congregation, and you could feel this love in the sermons that he gave every week for the 62 years that he was a rabbi.
He would takes the fruits of each week's reading and he would weave these intricate tapestries of ancient and humanist thought.
And people would come from all over to hear him speak.
But here's the thing about my grandfather.
Underneath this ceremonial role, he was really modest and really introverted -- so much so that when he delivered these sermons, he had trouble making eye contact with the very same congregation that he had been speaking to for 62 years.
And even away from the podium, when you called him to say hello, he would often end the conversation prematurely for fear that he was taking up too much of your time.
But when he died at the age of 94, the police had to close down the streets of his neighborhood to accommodate the crowd of people who came out to mourn him.
And so these days I try to learn from my grandfather's example in my own way.
So I just published a book about introversion, and it took me about seven years to write.
And for me, that seven years was like total bliss, because I was reading, I was writing, I was thinking, I was researching.
It was my version of my grandfather's hours of the day alone in his library.
But now all of a sudden my job is very different, and my job is to be out here talking about it, talking about introversion.
(Laughter)
And that's a lot harder for me, because as honored as I am to be here with all of you right now, this is not my natural milieu.
So I prepared for moments like these as best I could.
I spent the last year practicing public speaking every chance I could get.
And I call this my "year of speaking dangerously."
(Laughter)
And that actually helped a lot.
But I'll tell you, what helps even more is my sense, my belief, my hope that when it comes to our attitudes to introversion and to quiet and to solitude, we truly are poised on the brink on dramatic change.
I mean, we are.
And so I am going to leave you now with three calls for action for those who share this vision.
Number one:
Stop the madness for constant group work.
Just stop it.
(Laughter)
Thank you.
(Applause)
And I want to be clear about what I'm saying, because I deeply believe our offices should be encouraging casual, chatty cafe-style types of interactions -- you know, the kind where people come together and serendipitously have an exchange of ideas.
That is great.
It's great for introverts and it's great for extroverts.
But we need much more privacy and much more freedom and much more autonomy at work.
School, same thing.
We need to be teaching kids to work together, for sure, but we also need to be teaching them how to work on their own.
This is especially important for extroverted children too.
They need to work on their own because that is where deep thought comes from in part.
Okay, number two: Go to the wilderness.
Be like Buddha, have your own revelations.
I'm not saying that we all have to now go off and build our own cabins in the woods and never talk to each other again, but I am saying that we could all stand to unplug and get inside our own heads a little more often.
Number three:
Take a good look at what's inside your own suitcase and why you put it there.
So extroverts, maybe your suitcases are also full of books.
Or maybe they're full of champagne glasses or skydiving equipment.
Whatever it is, I hope you take these things out every chance you get and grace us with your energy and your joy.
But introverts, you being you, you probably have the impulse to guard very carefully what's inside your own suitcase.
And that's okay.
But occasionally, just occasionally, I hope you will open up your suitcases for other people to see, because the world needs you and it needs the things you carry.
So I wish you the best of all possible journeys and the courage to speak softly.
Thank you very much.
(Applause)
Thank you.
Thank you.
(Applause)
"Google began as a research project in 1996."
"This is a look at how search has evolved."
Gomes:
Our goal is actually to make improvements to Search that just answer the user's information need.
Get them to their answer faster and faster.
So that there's almost a seamless connection between their thoughts and their information needs and the search results that they find.
Singhal:
Well, Google was started based upon algorithms that Larry and Sergey developed in Stanford called the PageRank algorithm.
And they used that algorithm to indeed build a very novel way of searching the web.
Gomes:
What was happening at that point was there was this huge explosion of content in the web, a bigger explosion of information than had ever happened before.
And it was getting increasingly hard to find the piece of content you wanted.
"Adwords"
Mayer:
In the beginning, we didn't have any advertisements at all.
And as we went to add advertisements, it was very important to us that those ads be as relevant to the search as the search results themselves.
It was also very important to us that they be distinguished from the search results.
There was a clear separation between ads and Search from the very earliest times.
Search had one goal and one goal alone, to provide the most relevant information for the user in the fastest time possible.
"Universal Results"
Mayer:
In 1999 and 2000, we had a search engine that worked wonderfully, and it worked wonderfully for web pages.
One of the things we saw was, as Google got better and better, users expected more and more from it.
They didn't want just web pages.
They wanted the best possible information available, be that a picture or a book.
And so we started looking at how we could search new and other forms of content.
And Image Search was the first of those because we know that a picture is worth 1,000 words, and there were a lot of times when people would say, you know, what is turquoise?
You know, we got a search, "what is turquoise?"
And there's no way to answer that question without a picture.
When September 11th happened, we as Google were failing our users.
Our users were searching for "New York Twin Towers," and our results had nothing relevant, nothing related to the sad events of the day because our index was crawled a month earlier, and, of course, there was no news in that index.
So we placed links to all the news organizations like CNN right on our front page saying please visit those sites to get the news of the day, because our search is failing you.
My friend Krishna and I were attending a conference at the time, and Krishna started thinking about the problem, saying, "If we could crawl news quickly,
"and we can provide multiple points of view
"about the same story to our users, wouldn't it be amazing?"
That was the birth of Google News specialized search service.
Well, in 2002, one of the trends we started to see was that the web had become a lot more rich.
More images, more video, different kinds of content.
And we started to realize that our users expected Google to be able to find something if it existed on the web.
They didn't care if it was text or a web page or news, they wanted it all in one place.
And so we came up with this notion of Universal Search, the idea that you could just go to Google, and no matter what type of content it was, we could find it.
One of the challenges that came up in Universal Search is that we were really comparing apples and oranges.
You can imagine these apples are web pages, and you can imagine an orange would be an image.
When we look at ranking images, we know what the aspect ratio of an image is, how big is the image, how many pixels this image is.
Is it a black and white image or a color image?
And all these signals are only relevant to images, but are not relevant to web pages.
And that's why Universal Search was such a hard task when we did it, because the science was not fully developed.
Mayer:
We basically ended up putting things either on the top of the page, on the bottom of the page, or somewhere in the middle because we didn't have a finer-grained way of looking at the relevance, especially across different media types.
And over the years, we developed our science tremendously, and today we are beginning to place several kinds of information in multiple positions on our result page as our algorithms get better and better.
"Quick Answers"
Our goal is to make it so that the improvement we make is so much what you wanted and fits so cleanly into the flow of what you are looking for that you almost don't notice that it's happened.
And looking back at it, it seems obvious that that's the way it should have always been in the first place.
Menzel: When you do need a specific bit of information, Google tries to provide you exactly that using our Quick Answers.
For example, take sport scores.
You kind of want to know what the score is right now.
You want to know how tall is the Empire State Building?
Wright: We want users to come to Google and get their information as quickly as they possibly can.
And with Instant, you don't even have to type in your full thought.
You don't have to hit enter.
You can type in something like, "bike h," and we'll just show you the results right there before you've even finished your thoughts.
"The Future of Search"
We are pushing the boundaries of how you actually fundamentally interact with the search engine itself.
With Search by Image, you can actually use that image as an input for the search.
The truth is that our users need much more complex answers.
My dream has always been to build the "Star Trek" computer.
And in my ideal world,
I would be able to walk up to a computer and say,
"Hey, what is the best time for me to sow seeds in India, given that monsoon was early this year?"
And once we can answer that question, which we don't today, people will be looking for answers to even more complex questions.
These are all genuine information needs.
Genuine questions that, if we, Google, can answer, our users would become more knowledgeable, and they would be more satisfied in their quest for knowledge.

What are you doing?
Like a thief.
That's not it.
I had to look for something.
Do you expect me to believe that?
When there is nobody but us home, you suddenly had something to find?
No.
Really.
Are they busy?
Seems like they're sleeping.
Why are you like this?
What do you mean why am I like this?
Didn't you come in here wanting this?
What?
No!
So what?
We're the only ones in the house.
Seung Jo, why are you like this?
Seung Jo ssi!
Aigoo!
First... ...let's soundly date.
Soundly?
When was that word ever used?
Soundly.
Oh.
You came.
What the...
What's wrong with Oh Ha Ni?
Her face is really red.
Really?
I wonder what's wrong.
Stupid jerk.
Always playing around with me.
Am I really dumb?
After this (the love letter being graded)...
Doongi ah.
Is it supposed to be like this?
My heart... ...it isn't doing what I want it to do.
- Hey, what about Oh Ha Ni?
- She must not be on here.
- Did Oh Ha Ni's grades drop?
- What happened?
Why isn't she on here?
So it was because of Baek Seung Jo's help.
After going to the Special Study Hall, I found out it wasn't that great.
The kids there are weird too.
Anyway...
Out of all those colleges, isn't there one we can go to?
There will be one.
A college that will accept you... There will be one.
Let's try for a special circumstance admission.
A special circumstance admission?
In truth, for an exceptional admission you need to have many letters of recommendation and awards or trophies as well.
Anyway, you have to be really good at something.
This...
Even though one may not be doing that well now, they choose those who they think will do well in the future.
Ah!
Latent potential!
That's right!
Here, let's look for a place that'll match us.
By any chance, was your grandfather a patriot?
It's okay if it's the grandfather on the mother's side.
Really?
Ha Ni.
Your grandfather (maternal)... ...was a shutter man (opens and closes the shop shutter, i.e., while his wife works, he plays).
Ah, he was ahead of his time...
Okay.
Uhhh...
Was your father a special agent?
Special missions?
Well...
There is something special in making noodles. Ha Ni, it will work if you're the female householder.
Ha Ni...
Your dad...
Should I just move out?
It's unlikely... ...but you're not from a multicultural heritage, are you?
Multicultural heritage?
Think about it, Dad.
Did Mom possibly speak Thai or anything like that?
She didn't do that?
Thai?
Tom Yam Koong! (a kind of Thai food called sour soup)
Does this mean that there's not a single one out of all of these?
I'm worrying!
Stop doing that!
Blood donation?
You can have it.
There's a lot at home.
Do you donate a lot of blood?
Once every two months.
I donate more through money.
You should have said something earlier!
It says that giving blood once equals ten hours of service!
Really?!
Then, if it's ten times... 100 hours?!
Yeah!
I found it.
The "Giving Back to the Community" option.
Social Science.
Parang University?
Yeah.
Min Ah, you're also going to Parang University, right?
Yeah, as an animation major.
Our teacher said to try it once.
Wow, then are you both going to Parang University?
If we get in that is.
Even if the application goes through, I heard the interview process is very picky.
I have a skill examination as well.
How come our teacher didn't say anything to me about Parang University?
What are you doing?!
Look at you.
Stop eating.
I'm getting angry so give it to me.
Ju Ri.
I was wondering why we hadn't seen you around, especially since Oh Ha Ni is here.
What?
Did you put some kind of tracker on her?
How did you just pop out of nowhere like a ghost?
You guys still don't know?
Ha Ni is my life's navigation system.
She tells me where I need to go, location, direction, speed.
Navigation my butt.
Hey, where are all your little friends and why did you come alone?
They went to an audition.
They practice for auditions after all.
Really?
Oh my, I thought they were audition applicants since they go to auditions all the time.
What are you saying, girl?
What?
What?
Isn't that Baek Seung Jo?
I think you should go to a school with lots of history and tradition... ...a university that has produced many great scholars.
Or the American Ivy Leagues...
Who's the guy in front of him?
What are they talking about?

Special skill?
Specialty?
Specialty?!
Specialty?!
Specialty?!
You're working hard.
Of course.
Do you think I'm a teacher who plays around like a certain someone?
Me?
When...have I ever played around that makes you say that?
Vice principal.
Please give me what you told me about a while ago.
What was it?
Ah!
The Principal's recommendation?
How can I do that?!
How can I give a Principal's recommendation to the bottom ranked students?
Oh Ha Ni went up from the bottom ranks to the top fifty in one week.
If that's not potential, then what is?
The special case admissions look at potential.
Yes, that is so.
Look at the kids who got into college last year.
70% were ranked 1st, 2nd, or 3rd class.
Just because a person has passion, does that make them a good teacher?
They have to be able to teach the kids about looking into reality properly.
If Oh Ha Ni gets into Parang University... ...then I am Teacher Song's child.
Always passionate...
Excuse me...
This.
It's vitamin C.
You should dissolve it in water.
This is the first time, you seem like a person.
You're head over heels for me, aren't you?!
It's done!
Uh...
Self introduction.
I was born August 11th...
Okay.
Okay, so now...
I just have to register...
What!
What's wrong with this?
Why isn't it opening?!
What?
Error Report?
"Please click here."
Click.
"What you were working on..." "...will be lost."
Is it going well?
Why did you have so many useless tabs open?
I didn't!
What do I do?
What do I do?!
What to do?!
It's going to be okay, Ha Ni.
It couldn't have all been erased.
In a little bit, it will close.
Urgh, shut up!
I can't think straight.
It's fixed!
Really?
What about the written application?
It's there!
Really?
It's not gone?
Yes, he found it!
Oh, thank you.
Stop fooling around and quickly get the receipt.
Yes.
Oh, it's a relief.
Hurry and go downstairs to have dinner.
Let's go, Eun Jo.
Let's go down.
What's wrong?
Thank you.
Parang University undergraduate course?
Yes.
Actually, there aren't a lot of possibilities for me.
My grades are really bad.
You went that crazy when you don't even really have a chance?
Still, I have to try doing what I can.
Why are you going to college?
Huh?
Why do you ask?
Well, to study and...
Having nothing you're good at, nor a field you're interested in... ...why are you still doing this?
If not to study, then I can find my purpose in life.
Find out about what I like or what I'm good at.
How would you know if you like something?
Of course you would know!
Your heart starts beating fast.
If you find something you like, it'll beat fast here.
My dad...
When he smells noodles drying, his heart still beats fast.
I'd like to experience it too, that kind of feeling.
Ah, hurry!
I wonder why I'm going to college?
I've never worried about it before.
After all, geniuses must have their own worries.
Did he show me a little of his feelings?
Ah!
[Acceptance Letter]

Did you have to print them out?
It feels good.
Well, there are always those one or two mysteries.
Yes, there are.
But, please, it would be nice if they weren't from Class 7.
Then, if you pass the interview you can go to Parang University?
They said they chose a lot.
The competition isn't a joke.
They only picked a multiple of five.
But, what will they ask at the interviews?
I'm not really good with speaking.
I still have the skills exam too.
There is no way my Ha Ni can fail that interview.
Even if she does fail, at least she got it.
My Ha Ni is really good, isn't she?!
Ha Ni sunbae, do you have some kind of backing?
Backing?
Yeah.
The heavens must've helped me.
The 11th typhoon, "La Na Nim", is blowing through Korea.
Ha Ni!
Dad!
What is this?!
The subway is going to be safe.
Ha Ni, will you be okay?
Of course!
After all, it's just raining.
It's not just raining!
There's a typhoon out there.
Right!
Just don't...
How about giving up the interview?
Why!
You think I don't have a chance of getting in?
You don't believe in me, Dad?!
Th...that's not it!
Just look at the weather!
This is the only place that will accept me despite my grades.
Even if it's only because I'm grateful, I have to go.
Dad, don't worry.
I'll be going now!
Bye!
Right!
Right!
- Be careful!
- I'll see you later.
- But just wait. - I don't wanna!
Nothing's going easily.
You're right.
A typhoon coming so suddenly.
Because the tracks are filled with water, the subway will not continue to run.
All passengers are asked to leave the train at the next stop, and find other means of transportation to reach their destinations.
Seoul, Kyung Gi schools have already closed today because of the typhoon.
Typhoon warning: Schools in the central district of Seoul will be closed.
All companies will open late. Forecast for Seoul: there will be heavy rain from today until tomorrow. High winds expected with major flooding.
Student, you didn't have a lot of trouble getting here?
My house is nearby.
That's a relief.
You can leave this way.
Only a small number of students have arrived.
Excuse me...
Many students were not able to make it.
Wouldn't it be best if we postpone the interviews?
How many typhoons will come in one's lifetime?
Eh?
Whenever that happens, should we postpone and end it here?
Send in the next one.
Next student, please come in. Brought to you by the PKer team @ www.Viki
Eun Jo, what are you doing?
Alright!
I'm not going to school because of the typhoon.
Aigoo, Ha Ni going to an interview in this kind of weather...
I hope the results are good.
This is interesting.
Well then, what are you most interested in?
Oh, that.
It's Baek Seung Jo!
Um, what I meant to say was... ...a person.
Oh, you have an interest in people?
Yes!
That's right, people!
Recently, I've been thinking... ...if we were to get to know other people, how much time would it take to get to know them?
In our lifetime, could we fully understand... ...even one person?
I don't think I could ever understand Baek Seung Jo.
Why must we choose you?
Excuse me?
Your teacher's letter of recommendation... ...is almost at the level of a pledge in blood.
Even so...
In a week, you were able to raise your grades from the 90th place to the 50th.
However, on the very next test, you dropped back down again.
And since last year, every two months... ...you've donated blood.
That is all. How could you possibly have passed the first round?
She got a high score for her personal introduction.
Her confidence is high and her community service is amazing.
We're not picking just any miscellaneous writer.
If there is any reason why we must choose you, Oh Ha Ni, then please do tell!
There's one minute left.
Uh.
That...
Okay. If you don't have any, you don't have to say anything.
Nice job.
Next participant.
Yes.
Excuse me.
You were right.
You saw through me.
I really don't have anything that I do well.
Passing the first round was a miracle for me.
So, in truth, I'm really thankful.
However, I think I could say this...
If it's not me, and you picked another student with good grades and lots of awards... Anyway, if you picked such a stellar student, but if that student is lazy, and doesn't work hard!
When it's rainy and windy, he gives up.
So, then if you guys think that person isn't right for your college, if that happens, then choose me!
I'm slower than other people, but I never give up.
I always do everything till the end.
That's why my nickname is "Noah's Snail."
Try having a snail as a pet.
I don't think I'm going to make it.
I knew...
Ah well, the results haven't come yet.
Yeah, that's right.
You can study and go together with Seung Jo.
I'm not going to take the exam.
What?
I'm saying that I don't want to take the exam.
I'm not going to college.
Yeah, but why?
Because there isn't anything I want to do.
And I don't want to go anywhere either.
Huh.
Then, what will you do after graduating?
Well, I could work part time.
Baek Seung Jo!
Is your life a joke!?
Do you live life however you feel like living it?
Well, then do you want to do business with your mom?
What about running an internet shopping mall?
Then, how am I supposed to live?
What?
Because I don't know how to live... ...is why I say I won't go.
Because I don't want to live like other people, without any motives.
How should I live?
Aye... Tec...
That's...
You can study and take over your father's company.
You know that I'm selfish, right?
A business that doesn't fit my liking...
I don't have any plans of working there.
Don't expect anything from me.
Baek Seung Jo!
I'm done eating.
Really... That punk...
Aish.
He's only saying that; it's not like he won't take it. Don't worry.
Y-y-yeah, right.
No matter what he does, he can do it with ease, that must be why he doesn't feel any motivation.
He has to find a field of interest soon.
I'd really like to experience it too. That feeling.
Min Ah's.
- We'll enjoy the meal!
- We'll enjoy the meal!
Here... I made these for you guys on such a special occasion.
The name is Bul Nak porridge.
Bul Nak porridge?
It's written right here. Bul means "not," Nak means "fail". Never fail.
- Ahhh.
- It's really written.
What did you write this with?
You don't know?
They're sesame seeds.
So, it means that if you eat this, you guys will never fail.
Oh really!?
Then I'll just have to eat everything here.
Hey, Jung Ju Ri.
Stop it.
Is this all yours?
What?
"Ah, is this all yours?" Is he speaking Japanese?
Jung Ju Ri, just stop it.
Are all these yours?
Yeah. She's right right right!
Yes, eat up.
Ha Ni, you aren't eating?
I'm eating.
Ha Ni.
What?
Are you getting nervous?
There's no need!
Just eat up all this that your dad made for you.
Then just walk down proudly!
Right?
Yeah, you too.
Ah. Father.
This recipe is just killer!
Is this octopus?
Aigoo, you know well.
Father, I told you last time.
My taste buds are really sensitive.
I can't let it go.
Well, eat a lot!
And do well on the test tomorrow.
Like the octopus, stick to (get into) a college.
Yes.
Dad.
Yes?
Could you pack one more of this porridge?
Are you sleeping?
Baek Seung Jo.
You're going to take that test tomorrow, right?
Everyone is worried about you.
Especially your father.
He keeps worrying about you and he doesn't laugh very often.
First you could take the test, then later you can make a decision on college.
If you don't take the test, but suddenly you figure out what you want to do, then what will you do?
Open the door for a moment.
You can do anything.
So, you have to use your head for the sake of other people.
I believe that people who have a lot need to share what they have.
Even though I want to share everything, I don't have anything, so I can't.
This... I'll just leave it here.
Eat it before it cools.
Also...
See you tomorrow.
Maybe...
I... I have medicine.
Just a sec...
This one is very effective.
It's the best! Here's some water!
Thank you.
This doesn't cause drowsiness, right?
What?!
What?!
"Do not use in case of driving or activities that require concentration."
Oh!
It causes drowsiness!!
What to do?!
Spit it out.
Hey, what are you doing?!
Everything you do is like this anyway.
It'll be alright, since you're strong!
Wait!
You guys have to take your packed lunches.
Filled with nutritious food I have... ...especially made "Exam Pass" lunches.
Thank you very much.
Thanks, Dad!
Thanks, man.
When did you prepare something like this?
That's right...
Thank you very much.
Oh, it was no sweat.
Wise choice.
Good luck!
Yes.
FlGHTlNG!!
You thought well.
Everyone likes it (the decision to take the test).
Nice boy.
Stop joking around.
Ah, fork...
Do you think I'm you?
Why would I spear a random answer?
Ah, that's right. I measured your corn by my own bushel.
- How far are you going to follow me!?
- Huh?
You're that way.
That's right... It's the opposite direction...
Go ahead.
I see... So our paths separate here.
Yeah... Baek Seung Jo needs to go on his own path.
Good luck on your test!
FlGHTlNG!
Aigoo, even so he went.
Yeah...
He's not my son, he's really a godsend... A godsend!
Up until yesterday, he was being stubborn and saying he wouldn't take it... ...why all of the sudden...?
I feel uneasy...
Something just makes me uneasy.
STUDENT! STUDENT!
There are only fifteen minutes left.
You haven't marked anything yet.
I took some cold medicine this morning... Brought to you by the PKer team @ www.Viki
It was totally scary!
The people didn't even smile.
"Why must we accept you?"
Ahh... She was like a witch.
Did you do well on the exam?
- I don't know...
I just took it.
- Aigoo.
I think I screwed up the entrance exam...
What do I do!
Ha Ni, exams are already over so why are you complaining?
We don't even have class!
What have you been doing right now?
TADA!
You were putting on makeup?
Don't I totally look like Ga-In? (Brown Eyed Girls member) Ireoda naega michyeo yeoriyeori chak... (singing Brown Eyed Girls' hit song, "Abracadabra")
Oh, here...
You even have fake eyelashes?
Would you like me to put them on for you?
Sit down!
Sit down!
Ha Ni, even though you don't have double eyelids, your eyes are really big.
Close your eyes.
If you put some eyelashes on like this...
Wow!
You look very pretty!
Here, look in the mirror.
Jackpot.
Hey, Dok Go Min Ah, look.
Her eyes look ten times bigger, don't they?
If they were ten times bigger, she would be a monster.
Should I put it on the other side too?
Here.
Close your eyes.
Like this.
Hello!
Are you putting on makeup?
It's not makeup...
You have the guts to put on makeup after ruining someone else's life?
Huh?
I heard you gave Seung Jo Oppa sleeping pills on the morning of the college entrance exam.
What?!
What do you mean?
I heard you gave him cold medicine this morning.
After taking those, he fell asleep and had to fill in all the answers right before the test was over.
What are you going to do about it?
How are you going to take responsibility for what you've done?
Hey, Hong Jang Mi!!
Because of that, he might not be able to go to college, but you seem to only care about yourself.
Even like that, you still dare to say that you like him?
Right?
I'm asking you! It's okay, right? You did well, right?
That there was nothing wrong.
Jae Eun Jung.
Relax.
Kim Su Ahn.
We still have time.
Be strong.
Kids, in the next four days your scores will be out.
Yes.
Wherever you go, make sure you have your phones.
Yes.
Bong Joon Gu!
Oh.
Don't have that sad look on your face, okay?
I already have something planned for my life.
Really?
Yes.
So, Ha Ni, even if your scores don't come out that good...don't worry.
I'll take care of you forever.
HUUUUUUUU...
Bong Joon Gu, that's enough.
She has Baek Seung Jo.
What did you say?
Who did you say she has?
That cowardly guy can't make a girl happy.
Then what about you?
What can you do for Ha Ni?
What?
An axe comb?
What did you just say?
An axe comb?
Ah, be quiet!
That's enough.
Ha Ni...
Fighting!
Be strong!
Why?
Nothing.
After seeing this, I'm wondering if I really am a genius.
What's wrong, Seung Jo?
You're scaring me.
You still have the interview, so you just have to do that.
Ah, should we drop the curtains for you?
For getting into Tae San University with the highest score?
But honestly, with your skills, going to Tae San University seems like a waste.
You should be going to some place like Harvard.
Anyway, you did well!
Seung Jo, great job!
Hurray!
He did it!
Oh Ha Ni, even after getting those scores, you say "hurray"?
But how do I stop myself from being so happy!?
Baek Seung Jo HURRAY! Korea HURRAY!
Ring... Ring...
Please... Ring...
It will ring.
It will ring.
Please, help me.
It will ring.
Hello?
Yes.
This isn't the roast duck restaurant.
The number is 0292, but... ...this isn't the roast duck place.
Hello?
Yes.
Yes, I am Oh Ha Ni. Oh my!
Parang University?!
Is it right?
Really?
Wow, thank you!
Thank you.
What?
Oh!
I applied for the social sciences major.
Not the apple department?
Huh?
Apple department?
There's something like that...
Surprise!
Baek Eun Jo!
Oh Ha Ni dummy!
Aiyoo!
Baek Seung Jo is going to Tae San University with the highest score...
What am I going to do if I don't get into college at all?
Oh, Min Ah.
I got into Parang University.
Really?
Did they call you?
Just now.
Wow, congratulations!
And you, Ha Ni?
Not yet.
The call will come.
Yes.
Thank you.
Just wait.
Let's hang up.
Okay.
Ah, Min Ah.
Once again, super super congratulations.
You did well.
Why?
Someone like me doesn't have the right to eat.
Eat, eat!
Everything will be alright.
It's over.
Today's the last day for acceptances to be revealed.
It's already 10:00.
I already knew I wouldn't make it.
That witch...
No, that scary professor has no reason to accept me.
But, I was still thinking I could possibly get in.
Hey, you can still go with the SATs.
You can still get into a couple of places with that.
My scores aren't that good.
Hello!
Yes, it is me.
Parang University?
Hey, this...
It's you again, Baek Eun Jo!
What?
Why did you call my name?
Oh my!
Hello.
Yes.
Yes, it is me.
I'm sorry, I thought it was a prank call.
Just now, another person gave up their enrollment.
Student Oh Ha Ni, you passed as an additional acceptance.
Yes yes yes yes yes yes yes!
I will go, I will go, I will go!
Ah, hurray!
I think I really have good luck.
Because of the typhoon, kids couldn't go.
That's why I got the chance.
What would I have done if the typhoon hadn't come?
Yeah.
That's not it!
It's because of my Bul Nak porridge.
That's right.
Correct.
Here's a present.
Ahjusshi (Seung Jo's father) picked it out.
It's nothing big.
Wow!
It's really beautiful.
Thank you!
Thank you.
For what?
And this is my present.
There's another one?
These are musical tickets.
I've never seen a musical before.
It's this Saturday.
Let's meet in front of the theater at 2:30.
You hold on to the tickets.
You can't forget.
What do you mean forget?
Thank you.
Where are you?
Oh Ha Ni, you're in front of the theater, right?
What should I do?
There's so much traffic.
There's no traffic!
Because it's Saturday...
Why don't you go on ahead and leave one ticket at the booth.
Yes, I'll do that.
Hello.
Could I leave one ticket with you?
Ah... Yes.
The idol of every Korean girl, the Crown Prince...
Together with him, a new dream world of the 21st century opens up to you now!
So, 1996.
Ah, really!
I'm sorry. &gt; &gt;
Pass! I don't remember from when it was. When I started to keep thinking about you.
Ah...it hurts.
Why?
You want me to pinch them for you?
But, how did you come?
How do you think I came?
How?
Eun Jo, your mom is a really good actress, huh?
You heard me on the phone right?
"I'm in front of the theater, and I got stood up."
I have no one to see it with.
So, he said he got it and would come, that great Baek Seung Jo.
Should I just be an actress?
Was it really... ...just because of your acting?
Huh?
Excuse me.
You're going to do the interview for Tae San University, right?
Why are you being like that too?
I don't get why people keep saying college, college, college.
You're smart because you have something to offer.
It has to be that way.
Well, if I say "find your dream," it sounds huge, but... ...just have fun living.
Have fun.
Fun?
My grandma used to say that all the time.
"Ha Ni, have fun living, fun."
"You have fun and make others happy."
She said it'd be fine as long as I live like that.
Fun?
If you come to Parang University, I'll make it fun for you.
Oh, it's so nervewracking.
Just a bit more.
No, no.
This way, this way.
To the left.
Just a bit, just a bit.
Straight.
It's good, it's good!
You got it!
You got it!
You got it!
Aren't you going to take it?
Would I have gotten it so I could play with it?
Ha Ni!
Ha Ni!
Come here!
Come here!
What are you doing?
You guys went to a musical?
Think I'll go crazy.
Ha Ni, did he make a move on you?
Make a move?
I mean like while you guys were eating popcorn, doing hand motions like this or...
When watching a musical, you don't eat popcorn.
Oh, really?
Then what do you eat?
Oh!
Did you buy a doll?
Wow, it even talks.
This... Seung Jo got it for me, from that doll vending machine.
What?
He gave it to me as a congratulatory gift for getting into college.
Congratulatory gift?
He gave you such cheap trash?
Hey, Baek Seung Jo, are you making fun of Ha Ni?
What's wrong with this?
And he got it himself.
Hey!
You know how difficult doll vending machines are.
Ha Ni, what's hard about that?
Stuff like that, anyone can do it.
Really?
This was my first time seeing it.
Wow.
Hey!
Hey, did you see it!?
It was totally cool!
Here... Here... Watch this.
You saw that?
Hey!
Where are you going?
Look at this!
Look at this!
Urgh really!
Such a bother.
Here.
Look, look, look, look!
Urgh!!
Let me go, let me go, let me go.
Hey look!
That's not how it's done. Ah!
Is this what I see a lot in movies?
Look at me.
Look in my eyes.
In my eyes and in my heart, there is only you.
No.
I can't have both feelings in my heart.
Then I have no choice.
Whether it's by using love or using strength,
I have to make you love me.
Leave her alone.
No, please don't.
If you do, I will be scared for you.
A coward can die many times, but a real man can only die once.
If I die for you, that is not my death... ...it is love.
No!
Un Deux, Un Deux, Un Deux (One, Two).
What?
Son, do well!
Fighting!
Even if someone is rude to you, just let it be.
Do...do your best.
Good luck, Hyung.
Fighting!
Right.
After making me upset over going and not going, it's all over now.
Ah, this is so sad!
Why must they go through all of this at such a beautiful age?
You got married at that age. Why are they going on and on about college? I just don't get it.
Ha Ni!
Where are you going?
This isn't going to work.
My heart won't stop racing. I'll just keep an eye on him until he goes into the exam hall.
This is worrisome.
Worrisome.
Hey, did you see that?
That car totally hit someone!
It looks like it hit a girl.
She's waking up.
Ha Ni!
Aigoo!
My daughter!
Aigoo!
Dad.
Where is this place?
It's the hospital.
You were in a traffic accident.
Don't you remember?
You pooong...
I remember.
What about Seung Jo?
He went to take the test, of course.
That's a relief.
You came? Brought to you by the PKer team @ www.Viki Is Ha Ni still being like that?
Please take me in, Father! Can you please teach me? Please, Father...
It was fun. What could happen today... So?
That brat.
He's going to make noodles.
That hurts! When I go to college I'll find someone else... Then try to forget me.
So you're cruising around the Internet and you see a link to an article from some trusted news source and it's got a really intriguing title, so you read it.
And later you find out that that whole article was mostly false.
What you thought was news was really just gossip or conjecture.
So we've got Ryan Holiday here.
He's a media manipulator and he explains how this happens.
So, so what I quickly discovered was that the media was this sort of hierarchy or chain.
At the bottom you have small blogs who have small readerships but correspondingly low threshold for what they will and will not publish.
Say this blog publishes a rumor then Business Insider or The Huffington Post or Perez Hilton writes about.
And now, because of the stature of those sites, it becomes something that people are talking about on
Twitter, on Facebook, on email, they're chattering about it.
And what happens is producers for CNN, producers for a right wing talk radio, journalists for
The New York Times -- where do they find out the news?
They're not out pounding the pavement
like it's 100 years ago. No, they're reading what people are chattering about online.
And that cycle is hijacked by people like me who say, "Okay, if this blog here has the power to accidently start a media firestorm by what it publishes, I'm going to get them to publish something that benefits me."
I, I've sent them fake anonymous emails and watched as that turned into front page stories.
The public isn't aware that this is how their news is being made, but on both sides of the divide -- on the marketing side and on the news side -- neither is particularly concerned with quality.
They're concerned with what will get attention.
And that's because of how blog sites and news sites make money.
First, they get a lot of viewers to their pages. And then they sell that view count to advertisers.
So to get more views you do stuff like...
Asking rhetorical untrue questions in a headline; doing your fact checking after you've published an article; gossiping; speculating; making up a story from whole cloth.
But what if I want good, accurate news.
I mean, shouldn't news sites want to give that to me?
Yeah, look, uh, I think the rule of thumb is if you're not paying for it they don't give a shit about you.
They're loyal to their advertisers.
If you aren't paying for it you aren't the customer, you are really the product.
We're on problem 48.
It says if x squared is added to x, the sum is 42.
So let's just write that out.
If x squared is added to x, the sum is equal to 42.
Which of the following could be the value of x?
So essentially they just want us to solve this equation.
So the easiest way to do it is to write it as a quadratic equaling 0 and then factoring it.
So we could write this as x squared plus x minus 42 is equal to 0.
And let's think.
What two numbers when I add them equal 1, and when I multiply them equal minus 42?
And the fact that when I multiply them equals minus 42 tells me that one of them has to be positive and one of them has to be negative.
That's the only way that when you multiply two numbers you're going to have a negative number.
So one of them has to be positive, one of them has to be negative.
Today's question comes from Abroke who asks, "Europe is small compared with the United States, so will Google get a webspam team for smaller markets?" Great question.
It turns out we actually do have a webspam team based in
My name is Caine and I'm 9 years old
My arcade is called Caine's Arcade and it's only open on weekends.
And, it's really cheap.
Caine does not pass by an arcade without stopping in. He loves tickets, playing games. He loves prizes.

Singer..Don't speak to me, Is so hard to resist when you talk to me
Don't reach for me I know that you care, but when it comes up to loving, you are unaware Don't you know you are a perfect drug
Inside drives me blind with one look from you
Hi Dad.
Hi son, you're here.
I told you I will be here.
Is that the same woman that I saw at our house last night?
Yes, That's her.
She thinks she's in love with me.
Don't you know you are the perfect drug.
Are you serious?
Isn't she to young for you dad?
That's enough Ivan.
I did not asked you here for that.
And what that would be?
If you stop with the sarcasm, we can get to the point. there are two things I need you to do for me.
What is it?
Ivan, I don't know what got into you in the last few months.
You are totally different person, and is not good.
I have this friend and i want you to go talk with her.
Maybe she can help.
You are sending me to a shrink?
She is not a shrink, she is a very educated woman.
She is the best pshichologist in Moscow.
She is very good.
But I don't have any problems.
Why would I need a shrink?
Oh yes you do.
I need you to stay focused.
Not to do things that are below your station.
Fine I will go and see your highly recommended shrink.
You need to act like it.
It won't change anything.
What else do you want from me?
I won't do it!
Yes you are!
(applause) Hi honey.
What is wrong?
You look worried.
It is Ivan.
He is changing by the minute.
I don't know what to do about it.
He does not seem like he cares.
I'm worried about him.
Oh, I wish I could help.
He is a story
Enough with my words.
Tell me how have you been doing?
Oh, I don't have enough words to tell you.
It's
I'm so grateful for everything that you did for me Alex.

You are welcome.
Hi Ivan.
Have a sit.
How are you doing today?
Good. Thank You.
Ivan, I worked with a lot of people that worked with your father.
They all have problems.
They all can't sleep and they come to me because they have problems.
Whatever I have said in this room, Whatever they said in this room, stays in this room.
So don't be afraid to open up and tell me what is bothering you.
Oh, I'm not afraid.
Ivan.
Your father told me you are believing in God and you talk to God?
Do you want to tell me a little bit about it?
What's so hard to understand that i believe in God.
What's wrong with you people?
Are you feeling angry Ivan?
No. I'm not angry.
Do you want to talk about your feelings?
Oh, do you want to know how I feel?
I feel like I want to run.
I want to run away and never come back.
Ivan.
You have everything.
Everything that a kid can wish for.
Maybe you are right.
I have everything, except that I don't have love.
My father is killing people, you know that, and you feel so calm.
Let's make appointment for next week.
I won't see you next week.
I'm moving to United States.
I want to start a new life.
Hey, hey Ivan Here is the book you are looking for man.
Thank you Sergei.
You are a good friend Sergei.
Of course man.
Friends forever.
Forever man.
We know each other since we were kids man.
Yeah, that's why I have to tell you something.
Something important.
Tell me what.
I'm tired of this Mafia.
Is not for me.
So what are you gonna do?
How are you gone get out of this?
I'm moving to United States.
Are you crazy?
Your father won't let you do this in a million years.
If he is not gonna allow me, I'm just gonna run. I wonder if you can pull this off.
You know,
I was wondering about the same thing too.
Come with me then.
Let's go together to America.
That would be so great.
Move to America.
Get a new place.
Florida maybe!
I have something better!
What?
Hollywood.
Wow, Sunny California! maybe we can see some movie stars there too.
I have friends there, we can stay at Jacob's house.
Who is Jacob?
He is a kid I have met online.
He is a good guy.
He invited me over at his house.
You know what man?
Let's do it.
Let's do it.
I asked you to take care of that situation for you and you let me down.
I'm not like you.
I can't just pull the trigger and kill somebody for $5000, I'm not going to do it.
I built up this whole business, my whole life for you.
For you!
And you are just gonna live me like this?
I did not ask for.
Because of your business, mom is dead.
Died!
I don't have a mom.
I just have a dad who's too busy killing people, not hug his son or
love his family. I'm sick of this. I don't want to do this.
Why are you bringing up this old stuff.
This is got nothing to do with anything.
I sent you to the best schools in Moscow.
I gave you the best education you could possibly get. You've done everything you wanted.
You've done everything you wanted to to.
All I asked is to help me out in a situation but you wouldn't even do that.
Is not the help, is just to shoot somebody, come on.
I know you do this for whole your life, I just can't go and shoot somebody.
Is just crazy.
You know two years ago I found God.
I'm going every Sunday to Church.
I'm praying.
I'm happy.
Why do you want me to kill somebody.
This is crazy.
You use keep doing your thing if you think is right.
I'm just gonna.. just do your business I'm not gonna do this.
I'm gonna stay away from this.
This business is taking you to Los Angeles.
From where do you think you get all the money from?
Do you think it just grows on trees?
I did not ask for this.
I did not ask for you, I did not ask for mom, I'm your son and .. is just crazy, it just happened this.
My mother died because of this shit and rest of the stuff, you know?
I can't deal with this, you know?
Mom told me, I never told you this, but Mom told me before when I was a kid.
I still remember when I was 10 years old.
She told me, she was praying with me one night and she told me.
"I hope you are not gonna grow up like your Dad." I'm not gonna be like you.
I'll be something different like a Doctor or a Lawyer.
Something that people used to
look up to and say: "That's a good man, he is helping people.
Not shooting people." Unbelievable.
This business is our life. Ok?
You were groomed to take over the family business.
I don't have anybody else I can come on.
I can't count on my brother. i don't trust him too.
He is doing some crazy stuff behind your back.
I see him with different people from different groups of the town.
Your competitors in this thing. i don't like him too.
I don't like what you guys do, but I'm not gonna mix in this and not gonna tell you what to do.
Is just You know who to trust, just don't count on me.
I'm not gonna do it.
I can not trust my brother.
You are the only one I can trust.
This is when i need you most.
I ned you now.
I don't need you in Los Angeles.
I'm not gonna do it Dad, If you want to pull the gun and shoot me right here.
I'm not gonna do it.
Bible and God said DON"T KlLL.
I'm not gonna kill anybody for money.
Is not good.
My brother, he is a scumbag.
Is nobody I can trust but you.
I need you watching my back.
Do you know how many times a day somebody tries to kill me?
Dad, that's why i told you to live this business and start something else, retire and give up this.
He has been with you 15 years in this business.
Twenty, I don't even know.
He doesn't have a problem to shoot somebody.
You need that kind of people.
You don't need somebody like me who can't even shoot a guy.
Retire!
You don't just retire.
You don't just get out of this, just say "I'm done and that's it." It doesn't work like that.
That's why I don't want to jump in. Because if I jump in, there is no way out.
I want normal family, I want normal life.
I want to have wife, children, drive safe.
Not thinking somebody is going to kill me.
But you are already in. You can't get out.
You can't back out now.
You are past that point of no return.
This is it.
Ivan!
This is it!
This is the life.
This is what you were born into.
This is what i groomed you for all these years.
You can do this.
I need you.
Please.
Tell me you will stay.
Dad.
I'm just gonna run away from Russia, just go somewhere and start a new life.
Hopefully nobody is gonna find me somewhere and I'm gonna be happy and not hear again about this Mafia thing.
Stop the car.
I'I walk from here.
Are you sure?
Yeah, I'm sure.
I'll call you sometimes.
Tom, LA.
Tom, how are you?
Listen. My son is flying to LA tomorrow.
Can you look after him?
Thank you.
I knew I can count on you.
Sergei!
Sergei YOU ARE NOT GOlNG TO AMERlCA
Told you not to bother me.
I need some time alone.
I know Sir.
It's your brother.
He is here to see you.
What do you want Demitry?
I'm not exactly in the mood to talk with you right now.
Would you like something?
Ivan plane just took off.
I know that.
Is there anything else?
Actually no.
How could you?!
What?
Do you want Ivan to take over your place?
He is my son.
What did you expect?
I work for you for over 15 years and this is how you repay?
Oh, please.
You really didn't expect me to give you my empire, did you?
But Ivan he couldn't even kill a fly.
Why do you expect him to take over your business?
Huh?
He is a coward.
Don't you see that?
That's why I'm here.
This! -screaming-
Don't be stupid guys.
I'm in charge here now.
Hey, do you want to go to the airport?
Why, what's at the airport?
Do you remember the russian guy I've met, like, two months ago on the internet?
Yeah, what about him?
He is coming into town.
What is your mom going to say about this?
Hey, she is cool.
She said he can move with us.
Dog, are you coming or what?
Ok, allright.

So where is this russian friend of yours anyway?
Just be cool.
He will be here any minute.

So who is that guy?
I don't know.

Same thing.
You have a choice, German, French or English.
I took English so, I just took English.

Oh shit!
What's going on?
His uncle killed his father so he can take over the family business.
Now he wants Ivan dead too.
What's the family business?
He never mentioned it to you?
His father is the head of the Russian Mob.
What?!
He never mentioned the Mafia!
I knew there was something fishy about him.
He did not say anything to me.
Did he say anything to you?
No, he didn't.
Look, we do not have time for this.
We need to find Ivan and we need to find him now.
He is in trouble.
What kind of trouble.
I don't understand.
What is going on?
Let's find Ivan, let's find him now.
What are you talking Russian Mafia?
Man, I just want to play basketball.
Don't get me involved in this crap.
I'm not getting you involved.
I made a promise to his father a while back
I'll watch for him, and that's what I'm gonna do.
Well, I don't know how that involves me, so find Ivan yourself.
Look, Ivan's problem can become your problem, real quick.
We need to really help him now.
Don't be like this.
He is our friend.
The next time we see Ivan, he could be dead.
We need to find him now.
Get out of here.
I'll keep them busy!
Call the police!
Looking for me?
Get your ass up!
Demitry, welcome to the States!
Don't screw around.
This guy is crazy.
He is here to kill his nephew.
Do you think he's got a problem killing you?
I've made arrangements to get your clothes and your choice of transportation.
Why do I have to come out here and take care of things myself?
Tony, get in the car!
Not in the front sit.
Get in the back!
Where the hell do you find these guys?
What's wrong with you?
He is too dumb to pay him it any less.
Yes...
So what's your plan?
My plan is Well first of all I want to explain myself to you.
We had a problem catching Ivan because Tom was protecting him.
By who?
Tom.
I understand that you are upset but we took care of Tom.
Tom was protecting them, hiding them all over the city.
We have a guy in the back right here, that might know where Ivan might be.
But he is not giving us the information.
Let's tell him we don't have to friendly either and let's get some information out of him.
All right.
Let's go.
Have this stab on side.
Tony, give me your gun.
My gun?
Yes, your gun.
You are ready.

All right man.
Go on the phone, call who you need.
We need to find that kid right now.
Listen, when we spoke on the phone last fall you were suppose to be the man in LA.
Take care of everything. Every time you have a problem, I can't come from Moscow all the way here to make sure it is all OK.
You need to be in charge of that.
Alright, I'll take care of it.
I promised you, that you are going to have a shot at it and I'm gonna keep my word.
But every time you have a little problem, you need to be the man who solves these things out.
OK.
Tony.
Let's go!
I missed you so much.
Thank you for coming.
You did not change yet.
What happened.
No, I did not change yet.
I didn't go home.
Listen, I know we didn't know each other that long but i fell in love with you.
I feel like you are very special person.
I'm very happy that I've met you.
Last night I was thinking about you.
How beautiful you are, how good you smell and beautiful lips and eyes and.. perfect, you are perfect.
I fell in love with you and i have something for you.
I hope this is not gonna be a shock, but, would you marry me? Wow!
This is a big surprise.
I don't know what to say, I mean, I love you too but I barely met you.
I'll take that as a yes.
This is a beautiful ring.
It is a big surprise.
I love you.
I love you too.
Trying to run from me?
I got you now Jacob!
Nice work!
What's wrong man?
What were my instructions?
What were my instructions?!
We were suppose to get information and shoot his ass.
What information did you get?
He wasn't gonna talk anyways.
He never had a chance because you put a bullet in his brain before he had a chance to say anything!
Just tell him something else happened alright.
We'll tell him that he tried something so we had to put a bullet in his ass.
It's done.
We can't go back.
It's over.
You gonna want me to tell Demitry that?
You are going to tell him.
Fine.
If I'll have to, I'll tell him
It is just It takes like wow I was expecting to come here, I was alone, no friends and suddenly I've met you.
You are a great man and you know, I feel for you and it's happy.
I think, I think we are going to be very happy family.
We can have a good time together.
I think so too.
I'm so happy.
Where do you think we will live?
I don't know.
We will talk.
As long as we are happy, that's important.
I'm agreeing with you.
It is just, you know.
I'm new here and everything is crazy.
And you know, I have to get used to everything.
Get it step by step.
You know.
Me too.
I've been in Los Angeles for two days, but we're i think this is the best.
You came from Paris, I came from Moscow and we met and it is very cool.
Isn't that strange that we've met after you know, you came more that 12 hours in the plane, get here wow!
It is something amazing.
It is the best thing, you know.
People are suppose to meet each other.
Suppose to meet people they love.
It just happened to us.
Surprised.
You kind of remind me of my mom.
You look beautiful and you are an awesome person.
I've never met anybody like you, so open.
We've got good time and is awesome.
This is the most important.
I think is great.
I would like to meet your family, maybe they will come here.
Because you know, if we wanna marry.
You know.
Then.
I would like to know the members of your family, most of your family.
I think is important.
Yeah, met too.
I don't have much family.
My mom died when I was ten and I have...
I have my dad left and he is in Moscow.
Maybe he will come.
I think he will come when he will find out I'm getting married.
I think he is gonna love you.
He is very busy with his job.
I don't approve what he is doing with his job.
I think he is gonna love you, as a daughter.
I'm the only one son in the family so to have a daughter.
He is gonna have a daughter.
Beautiful.
Thank You.
I'm sorry what happened to your mom.
You had to grow up alone with your father.
You don't have your grandma helping you.
I don't know, is just...
I'm sad when I hear that because, it wasn't easy for you.
Yeah, you are right it wasn't easy.
Maybe this is why I've made this move so fast just to get married because, I missed us for the last 11 years.
I'm 21 and you are 20 and we are happy.
So is really cool.
I just have basically, like I've got my mom back.
I've got with the person that I'll spend my life with.
That is more than mom.
I'e got the person that I will spend my life with it.
Well, we are both young and hopefully we will get along together well, because we need more experience.
But I'm so happy to be here, I have only you here.
It is amazing.
You are amazing.
That's what happened to me.
I'm gonna pray to God that our marriage is gonna last forever and we are going to spend to death and die in the same day.
Wow!
I hope so too, in the dame day!
I promise you.
I'll treat you like a queen.
Uncle!
Ivan, are you alright?
Your father asked me if you are OK.
I'm OK, I'm gonna just use the restroom.
I'll ask Jacob's mom to make us some tea.
I don't think she is in any condition to fix us tea.
Ivan what are you doing?
Come back!
I just want to talk with you.
Celine!
Hey baby.
I had a nightmare.
I'm sorry.
I dreamed that my uncle came from Moscow and killed all my friends and killed you and we've got married and...
It is not that is just all my friends died, and you...
I've got a call.
That's from Moscow.
Take it.
Hello.
What?
What happened?
Somebody called me from Moscow.
One of my uncles said that my dad got shot two days ago
What!
I'm so sorry.
Oh, poor you.
When I've got the news that my father died is like my dream became alive.
Where is Tony?
Who's Tony?
The guy from the airport.
That guy.
He took the Escalade to the shop.
Had to get fixed.
Can he handle that?
I don't know.
He's gonna probably crush the damn thing.
I'm out.
Demitry, What did you got?
Full house.
Nobody is that lucky.
OK boys, that's enough.
Don't we have anything else to do?
Demitry, a little bit more poker won't kill you.
A little bit?
We're playing for one or two hours!
What else we're gonna do?
We have people to kill.
Let't get to work.
Work?
We don't work.
We don't have jobs.
Our only job, is you.
Don't you ever speak to me like that.
Or what?
You are messing with the wrong person.
You are going to come to our country, my city, and tell me what to do?
You guy, think I would give you a loaded gun?
Do you believe this guy?
Call Tony.
Tony!
Yeah. Come on in. We have a mess to clean.
Thank you Jake for not betraying me and taking care of Demitry.
Demitry thought he can come here and tell us what to do?
It was fun.
But he was wrong.
Now I can see I can trust you Jake.
I'm gonna let you run the area that you wanted so bad.
So you are going to put me in charge of LA?
After Demitry took out Alexander, we became independent.
Now nobody can tell us what to do.
Except for me.
Are you having a good time?
Yes, I am Jacob.
Baby, do you know what day is today?
It is our anniversary!
I can't believe I forgot about it.
I've got you something.
Oh, That is so sweet.
I love you baby.
Thank You for Watching BORN INTO MAFlA

So we're given the following equation, that 5 times the absolute value of x plus 3 minus 3 is equal to 7.
Now this is a very un-TED-like thing to do, but let's kick off the afternoon with a message from a mystery sponsor.
Anonymous:
Dear Fox News, it has come to our unfortunate attention that both the name and nature of Anonymous has been ravaged.
We are everyone.
We are no one.
We are anonymous.
We are legion.
We do not forgive.
We do not forget.
We are but the base of chaos.
Anonymous, ladies and gentlemen -- a sophisticated group of politically motivated hackers who have emerged in 2011.
And they're pretty scary.
You never know when they're going to attack next, who or what the consequences will be.
But interestingly, they have a sense of humor.
These guys hacked into Fox News' Twitter account to announce President Obama's assassination.
Now you can imagine the panic that would have generated in the newsroom at Fox.
"What do we do now?
Put on a black armband, or crack open the champagne?"
(Laughter)
And of course, who could escape the irony of a member of Rupert Murdoch's News Corp. being a victim of hacking for a change.
(Laughter) (Applause)
Sometimes you turn on the news and you say, "Is there anyone left to hack?"
Sony Playstation Network -- done, the government of Turkey -- tick,
Britain's Serious Organized Crime Agency -- a breeze, the ClA -- falling off a log.
In fact, a friend of mine from the security industry told me the other day that there are two types of companies in the world: those that know they've been hacked, and those that don't.
I mean three companies providing cybersecurity services to the FBI have been hacked.
Is nothing sacred anymore, for heaven's sake?
Anyway, this mysterious group Anonymous -- and they would say this themselves -- they are providing a service by demonstrating how useless companies are at protecting our data.
But there is also a very serious aspect to Anonymous -- they are ideologically driven.
They claim that they are battling a dastardly conspiracy.
They say that governments are trying to take over the Internet and control it, and that they, Anonymous, are the authentic voice of resistance -- be it against Middle Eastern dictatorships, against global media corporations, or against intelligence agencies, or whoever it is.
And their politics are not entirely unattractive.
Okay, they're a little inchoate.
There's a strong whiff of half-baked anarchism about them.
But one thing is true: we are at the beginning of a mighty struggle for control of the Internet.
The Web links everything, and very soon it will mediate most human activity.
Because the Internet has fashioned a new and complicated environment for an old-age dilemma that pits the demands of security with the desire for freedom.
Now this is a very complicated struggle.
And unfortunately, for mortals like you and me, we probably can't understand it very well.
Nonetheless, in an unexpected attack of hubris a couple of years ago, I decided I would try and do that.
And I sort of get it.
These were the various things that I was looking at as I was trying to understand it.
But in order to try and explain the whole thing, I would need another 18 minutes or so to do it, so you're just going to have to take it on trust from me on this occasion, and let me assure you that all of these issues are involved in cybersecurity and control of the Internet one way or the other, but in a configuration that even Stephen Hawking would probably have difficulty trying to get his head around.
So there you are.
And as you see, in the middle, there is our old friend, the hacker.
The hacker is absolutely central to many of the political, social and economic issues affecting the Net.
And so I thought to myself,
"Well, these are the guys who I want to talk to."
And what do you know, nobody else does talk to the hackers.
They're completely anonymous, as it were.
So despite the fact that we are beginning to pour billions, hundreds of billions of dollars, into cybersecurity -- for the most extraordinary technical solutions -- no one wants to talk to these guys, the hackers, who are doing everything.
Instead, we prefer these really dazzling technological solutions, which cost a huge amount of money.
And so nothing is going into the hackers.
Well, I say nothing, but actually there is one teeny weeny little research unit in Turin, Italy called the Hackers Profiling Project.
And they are doing some fantastic research into the characteristics, into the abilities and the socialization of hackers.
But because they're a U.N. operation, maybe that's why governments and corporations are not that interested in them.
Because it's a U.N. operation, of course, it lacks funding.
But I think they're doing very important work.
Because where we have a surplus of technology in the cybersecurity industry, we have a definite lack of -- call me old-fashioned -- human intelligence.
Now, so far I've mentioned the hackers Anonymous who are a politically motivated hacking group.
Of course, the criminal justice system treats them as common old garden criminals.
But interestingly, Anonymous does not make use of its hacked information for financial gain.
But what about the real cybercriminals?
Well real organized crime on the Internet goes back about 10 years when a group of gifted Ukrainian hackers developed a website, which led to the industrialization of cybercrime.
Welcome to the now forgotten realm of CarderPlanet.
This is how they were advertising themselves a decade ago on the Net.
Now CarderPlanet was very interesting.
Cybercriminals would go there to buy and sell stolen credit card details, to exchange information about new malware that was out there.
And remember, this is a time when we're seeing for the first time so-called off-the-shelf malware.
This is ready for use, out-of-the-box stuff, which you can deploy even if you're not a terribly sophisticated hacker.
And so CarderPlanet became a sort of supermarket for cybercriminals.
And its creators were incredibly smart and entrepreneurial, because they were faced with one enormous challenge as cybercriminals.
And that challenge is:
How do you do business, how do you trust somebody on the Web who you want to do business with when you know that they're a criminal?
(Laughter)
It's axiomatic that they're dodgy, and they're going to want to try and rip you off.
So the family, as the inner core of CarderPlanet was known, came up with this brilliant idea called the escrow system.
They appointed an officer who would mediate between the vendor and the purchaser.
The vendor, say, had stolen credit card details; the purchaser wanted to get a hold of them.
The purchaser would send the administrative officer some dollars digitally, and the vendor would sell the stolen credit card details.
And the officer would then verify if the stolen credit card worked.
And if they did, he then passed on the money to the vendor and the stolen credit card details to the purchaser.
And it was this which completely revolutionized cybercrime on the Web.
And after that, it just went wild.
We had a champagne decade for people who we know as Carders.
Now I spoke to one of these Carders who we'll call RedBrigade -- although that wasn't even his proper nickname -- but I promised I wouldn't reveal who he was.
And he explained to me how in 2003 and 2004 he would go on sprees in New York, taking out $10,000 from an ATM here, $30,000 from an ATM there, using cloned credit cards.
He was making, on average a week, $150,000 -- tax free of course.
And he said that he had so much money stashed in his upper-East side apartment at one point that he just didn't know what to do with it and actually fell into a depression.
But that's a slightly different story, which I won't go into now.
Now the interesting thing about RedBrigade is that he wasn't an advanced hacker.
He sort of understood the technology, and he realized that security was very important if you were going to be a Carder, but he didn't spend his days and nights bent over a computer, eating pizza, drinking coke and that sort of thing.
He was out there on the town having a fab time enjoying the high life.
And this is because hackers are only one element in a cybercriminal enterprise.
And often they're the most vulnerable element of all.
And I want to explain this to you by introducing you to six characters who I met while I was doing this research.
Dimitry Golubov, aka SCRlPT -- born in Odessa, Ukraine in 1982.
Now he developed his social and moral compass on the Black Sea port during the 1990s.
This was a sink-or-swim environment where involvement in criminal or corrupt activities was entirely necessary if you wanted to survive.
As an accomplished computer user, what Dimitry did was to transfer the gangster capitalism of his hometown onto the Worldwide Web.
And he did a great job in it.
You have to understand though that from his ninth birthday, the only environment he knew was gangsterism.
He knew no other way of making a living and making money.
Then we have Renukanth Subramaniam, aka JiLsi -- founder of DarkMarket, born in Colombo, Sri Lanka.
As an eight year-old, he and his parents fled the Sri Lankan capital because Singhalese mobs were roaming the city,
At 11, he was interrogated by the Sri Lankan military, accused of being a terrorist, and his parents sent him on his own to Britain as a refugee seeking political asylum.
At 13, with only little English and being bullied at school, he escaped into a world of computers where he showed great technical ability, but he was soon being seduced by people on the Internet.
He was convicted of mortgage and credit card fraud, and he will be released from Wormwood Scrubs jail in London in 2012.
Matrix001, who was an administrator at DarkMarket.
Born in Southern Germany to a stable and well-respected middle class family, his obsession with gaming as a teenager led him to hacking.
And he was soon controlling huge servers around the world where he stored his games that he had cracked and pirated.
His slide into criminality was incremental.
And when he finally woke up to his situation and understood the implications, he was already in too deep.
Max Vision, aka ICEMAN -- mastermind of CardersMarket.
Born in Meridian, Idaho.
Max Vision was one of the best penetration testers working out of Santa Clara, California in the late 90s for private companies and voluntarily for the FBl.
Now in the late 1990s, he discovered a vulnerability on all U.S. government networks, and he went in and patched it up -- because this included nuclear research facilities -- sparing the American government a huge security embarrassment.
But also, because he was an inveterate hacker, he left a tiny digital wormhole through which he alone could crawl.
But this was spotted by an eagle-eye investigator, and he was convicted.
At his open prison, he came under the influence of financial fraudsters, and those financial fraudsters persuaded him to work for them on his release.
And this man with a planetary-sized brain is now serving a 13-year sentence in California.
Adewale Taiwo, aka FreddyBB -- master bank account cracker from Abuja in Nigeria.
He set up his prosaically entitled newsgroup, bankfrauds@yahoo.co.uk before arriving in Britain in 2005 to take a Masters in chemical engineering at Manchester University.
He impressed in the private sector, developing chemical applications for the oil industry while simultaneously running a worldwide bank and credit card fraud operation that was worth millions until his arrest in 2008.
And then finally, Cagatay Evyapan, aka Cha0 -- one of the most remarkable hackers ever, from Ankara in Turkey.
He combined the tremendous skills of a geek with the suave social engineering skills of the master criminal.
One of the smartest people I've ever met.
He also had the most effective virtual private network security arrangement the police have ever encountered amongst global cybercriminals.
Now the important thing about all of these people is they share certain characteristics despite the fact that they come from very different environments.
They are all people who learned their hacking skills in their early to mid-teens.
They are all people who demonstrate advanced ability in maths and the sciences.
Remember that, when they developed those hacking skills, their moral compass had not yet developed.
And most of them, with the exception of SCRlPT and Cha0, they did not demonstrate any real social skills in the outside world -- only on the Web.
And the other thing is the high incidence of hackers like these who have characteristics which are consistent with Asperger's syndrome.
Now I discussed this with Professor Simon Baron-Cohen who's the professor of developmental psychopathology at Cambridge.
And he has done path-breaking work on autism and confirmed, also for the authorities here, that Gary McKinnon -- who is wanted by the United States for hacking into the Pentagon -- suffers from Asperger's and a secondary condition of depression.
And Baron-Cohen explained that certain disabilities can manifest themselves in the hacking and computing world as tremendous skills, and that we should not be throwing in jail people who have such disabilities and skills because they have lost their way socially or been duped.
Now I think we're missing a trick here, because I don't think people like Max Vision should be in jail.
And let me be blunt about this.
In China, in Russia and in loads of other countries that are developing cyber-offensive capabilities, this is exactly what they are doing.
They are recruiting hackers both before and after they become involved in criminal and industrial espionage activities -- are mobilizing them on behalf of the state.
We need to engage and find ways of offering guidance to these young people, because they are a remarkable breed.
And if we rely, as we do at the moment, solely on the criminal justice system and the threat of punitive sentences, we will be nurturing a monster we cannot tame.
Thank you very much for listening.
(Applause)
So your idea worth spreading is hire hackers.
How would someone get over that kind of fear that the hacker they hire might preserve that little teensy wormhole?
MG:
I think to an extent, you have to understand that it's axiomatic among hackers that they do that.
They're just relentless and obsessive about what they do.
But all of the people who I've spoken to who have fallen foul of the law, they have all said, "Please, please give us a chance to work in the legitimate industry.
We just never knew how to get there, what we were doing.
We want to work with you."
Chris Anderson:
Okay, well that makes sense.
Thanks a lot Misha.
(Applause)
I was thinking about my place in the universe, and about my first thought about what infinity might mean, when I was a child.
And I thought that if time could reach forwards and backwards infinitely, doesn't that mean that every point in time is really infinitely small, and therefore somewhat meaningless.
So we don't really have a place in the universe, as far as on a time line.
But nothing else does either.
Therefore every moment really is the most important moment that's ever happened, including this moment right now.
And so therefore this music you're about to hear is maybe the most important music you'll ever hear in your life.
(Laughter) (Applause)
(Applause)
Thank you.
(Applause)
(Applause)
For those of you who I'll be fortunate enough to meet afterwards, you could please refrain from saying,
"Oh my god, you're so much shorter in real life."
(Laughter)
Because it's like the stage is an optical illusion, for some reason.
(Laughter)
Somewhat like the curving of the universe.
I don't know what it is.
I get asked in interviews a lot,
"My god, you're guitars are so gigantic!"
(Laughter)
"You must get them custom made -- special, humongous guitars."
(Laughter)
(Applause)
Thank you very much.
(Applause)

Yeah, can you believe it? they're remaking Carrie.
I mean, that movie is a fucking classic.
Am I right?
Who's asshole idea was that?
And who are they going to get to play Carrie, Miley Cyrus?
Exactly.
Hey I got a great idea.
Why don't you hire Sharon Stone to play the mother and really fuck it up!
Oh, honey, I got to go.
Yes, some old friends are here.
No, I don't think the realize just how incredibly rude it is to show up right before someone goes out on stage.
Oh, I'm sorry Mrs. Beat.
They said they knew you.
Yeah, everybody knows me.
I'm famous!
Can I? Don't go anywhere.
Let me tell you something.
My writer is not being respected.
I was just backstage.
There's no beef jerky.
There's no cream cheese with the jalape√±o jelly.
No assorted crackers.
And what about this? Hello?
I specifically requested room temperature Fuji.
Not this Crystal Geyser bullshit!
I don't even want the word "Crystal" anywhere near me!
Uh... I'm sorry sir.
I mean mam!
GET THE FUCK OUT OF HERE!
Excuse me!!
Someone's in a good mood.
Yeah.
Hey.
Well, well, well.
If it isn't Curly and Larry.
Where the fuck is Mo?
It's about time you bitches came to my show.
I told you before, I need bears here.
That way even if it's half full it still looks packed.
What are you talking about Jackie?
We were front row center last Friday night.
Right, Wood?
What, no, remember.
You said you couldn't stomach another tired old drag queen.
I can hear you!
Listen, Jackie, the reason we stopped by.
Well, I'm sure you heard about the dead guy we found in our house.
Yeah.
Well, It turns out he was at your show the night before.
So I was hoping you could look at this picture and see if you recognize him?
Of course, I do!
I should have killed that asshole myself!
That deuche bag talked during my entire Celine Dion tribute.
Your Celine medley was the favorite part of the show.
We loved it right, Wood?
Oh, I cried.
Oh, you two are such Fucking Liars!!
Okay!
You didn't see my fucking show!
I would never do Celine Dion!
That was a test and you failed it!
Okay, we are so, so sorry Jackie.
But we just have a couple questions we want to ask.
And then I promise you will be right out your...hair.
So, you're not staying for the show?
Oh, I want to. I love your shows!
I mean, I especially like how famous singers
let you perform their hit songs, after they rewrite them for you with dirty lyrics.
Are you really that stupid?
I write the fucking dirty lyrics!
Whoa, whoa, whoa wait!
So Peggy Lee didn't write "Beaver" and then send it to you?
No!
And I got a news flash for you!
Don't freak out.
Peggy Lee is dead!
Wow, first Whitney, now Peggy.
Too soon.
Listen, we're really going to try to come to your show, but
You'll "try", to see my "show"
Huh, "friend"!
Listen, let me ask you a quick question.
How many Colt events have I attended?
Huh?
How many of those stupid travel book signings did I go to?
And don't even get me started on those horrible shows by Nelson.
Half Nelson! Full Nelson.
I swear to God!
My dental implants were less painful.
Okay, okay.
We will definitely stay for the show.
But just answer me this one question.
The dead guy that disrupted your performance.
Do you remember who he was here with, that night?
Of course, I do.
Ramone Santiago, of the Eagle LA.
Hot Toddy is a bartender at the Eagle.
Coincidence?
I think not!
Oh my God you guys!
This is so fascinating!
But Cagney and Lacey, guess what?
This little reunion's over.
Because I've got a sound check to do.
So get the fuck out.
Wait, wait, wait.
So, Katie Perry didn't write "I Kissed A Squirrel"?
GET THE FUCK OUT!
I swear to God that guy is like honey mustard.
He's hot and sweet, but essentially useless.
All right, from the top.
I Kissed A Squirrel.
This is really a two-hour presentation I give to high school students, cut down to three minutes.
And it all started one day on a plane, on my way to TED, seven years ago.
And in the seat next to me was a high school student, a teenager, and she came from a really poor family.
And she wanted to make something of her life, and she asked me a simple little question.
She said, "What leads to success?" And I felt really badly, because I couldn't give her a good answer.
So I get off the plane, and I come to TED.
And I think, jeez, I'm in the middle of a room of successful people!
So why don't I ask them what helped them succeed, and pass it on to kids?
So here we are, seven years, 500 interviews later, and I'm going to tell you what really leads to success and makes TEDsters tick.
And the first thing is passion.
Freeman Thomas says, "I'm driven by my passion."
TEDsters do it for love; they don't do it for money.
Carol Coletta says, "I would pay someone to do what I do."
And the interesting thing is: if you do it for love, the money comes anyway.
Work! Rupert Murdoch said to me, "It's all hard work.
Nothing comes easily.
But I have a lot of fun." Did he say fun? Rupert?
Yes!
(Laughter) TEDsters do have fun working.
And they work hard.
I figured, they're not workaholics.
They're workafrolics.
(Laughter)
(Applause) Alex Garden says, "To be successful, put your nose down in something and get damn good at it."
There's no magic; it's practice, practice, practice.
And it's focus.
Norman Jewison said to me,
"I think it all has to do with focusing yourself on one thing."
And push!
David Gallo says, "Push yourself. Physically, mentally, you've got to push, push, push."
You've got to push through shyness and self-doubt.
Goldie Hawn says, "I always had self-doubts.
I wasn't good enough; I wasn't smart enough.
I didn't think I'd make it."
Now it's not always easy to push yourself, and that's why they invented mothers.
(Laughter) (Applause)
Frank Gehry said to me,
"My mother pushed me."
(Laughter)
Serve! Sherwin Nuland says, "It was a privilege to serve as a doctor."
A lot of kids want to be millionaires.
The first thing I say is:
"OK, well you can't serve yourself; you've got to serve others something of value.
Because that's the way people really get rich."
Ideas!
TEDster Bill Gates says, "I had an idea: founding the first micro-computer software company."
I'd say it was a pretty good idea.
And there's no magic to creativity in coming up with ideas -- it's just doing some very simple things.
And I give lots of evidence.
Persist!
Joe Kraus says, "Persistence is the number one reason for our success."
You've got to persist through failure.
You've got to persist through crap! Which of course means "Criticism, Rejection, Assholes and Pressure."
(Laughter)
So, the answer to this question is simple:
Pay 4,000 bucks and come to TED.
(Laughter) Or failing that, do the eight things -- and trust me, these are the big eight things that lead to success.
Thank you TEDsters for all your interviews!
Here we find our fun friend Phillip riding around on a delightful day.
Phillip just loves his Twitter.
Ohhh, but there's a problem!
Phillip forgot to upload a Profile Photo, so when people look at his Twitter account all they see is a lonely little egg.
But editing a profile is super easy.
From the ME tab just click "Edit Profile"
Let's start by taking a photo with his computer's camera to get rid of that egg.
Smile for the laptop!
We can scale and position the photo so it looks just right.
Perfect!
Next, let's add a Header Photo.
We could upload one or (and this is the best part) you can drag and drop a file right in the header field!
You can do this for your Profile Photo, too.
Once it looks good, click "Apply"
While here you can fill out your bio field, your location, and website information so people know more about you.
Click "Save changes" and you're done!
If you go to SETTlNGS and click the DESlGN tab you can also change or upload a background image.
Just select the file you would like use and save your changes.
Awww bulldogs!
If you're on the go you can make these changes from the ME tab on Twitter's official applications.
Just tap the SETTlNGS gear... and select "Edit Profile"
You can now change your profile and header photos whenever you get the urge.
These features are brought to you by our engineers and designers who hope you enjoy perfecting your profile!
And on behalf of all of us here at Twitter:
"Happy Tweeting!"
&lt;i&gt;Brought to you by the PKer team @ www.viikii.net&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Episode 6
I'm sorry...
I'm really sorry.
I know how hard it was arranging to take this test.
Everyone was looking forward to it... But...
Because of me...
All because I needlesly tagged along.
You should have just left me and went on.
I should have, shouldn't I?
What you're saying is right.
I really am an obstacle in your life.
No!
Even that word doesn't describe it.
I'm a disaster.
Oh, it's here.
Where?
Oh, Ha Ni!
Ha Ni!
Aigoo!
What's happening here?!
What!?
You even have a cast!?
Aigoo! What to do...
Oh, Baek Seung Jo!
You agai...
Joon Gu, drop it.
Hey!
Whenever you're around Ha Ni, she's always prone to accidents!
I told you to drop it!
Oh?
Ha...
Ha Ni...
Just go.
Ha Ni...
I want to be alone now.
Hey, Ha Ni... Are you alright?
Come on, let go of me!
Ha Ni, is there anything you want to eat?
I'll go buy it and come back.
Ha Ni!
Let go of me, will you?
Should I leave as well?
Go...
Go and get some rest.
I'm really sorry.
I'm at a loss for words, Jae Su (sister-in-law) (He's referring to Seung Jo's dad as his brother)
Not at all...
That's right.
After dropping her off at the hospital, he still had plenty of time to go, but he chose not to.
But still... He was reluctant to take the test before and now he was going to...
He must have something in mind.
Don't worry...
After all, a youth who doesn't rebel is not a youth.
It's just a child.
Thanks, Unni.
Alright, now let's get to work!
The customers should be rolling on in soon.
- Yes.
- Yes.
Hey, Ha Ni, our family must have a knack for speedy recoveries.
Even the doctor said that there wasn't such a case like yours, where a patient left the hospital so early.
Dad...
Yeah?
Shouldn't we leave Seung Jo's house?
Why?
Do you feel like we're being senseless?
There's no need to!
Everyone is worrying about you more than they are for Seung Jo.
That's why it bothers me even more.
Why am I always like this?
Oh, welcome!
Hey, a customer came in now, so come on and get up.
I'll drop you off.
Is Ha Ni still sulking?
She won't move an inch from her room and she'll barely eat anything.
When everyone's asleep, she comes out and starts to walk around.
In the middle of the night, I was startled because I thought she was a ghost!
Baek Seung Jo.
You should treat her well.
Just a kind word from you will solve things. Why are you causing her so much grief!
I did tell her!
Really?
What did you say?
Thanks for not letting me do the interview.
Is that some sort of condolence?
That's like slapping the face of a crying kid.
You don't get to eat either until Ha Ni starts eating again. &lt;i&gt;I heard you gave Seung Jo some sleeping pills on the morning of the test.&lt;i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Even like this, do you think you still have any right to say that you like him?&lt;i&gt;
Good luck on your test!
FlGHTlNG! I'm feeling uneasy so I'm going to at least make sure he goes inside of the building.
[From: Ha Ni For:
Mother, Father... I'm sorry...]
Long time no see.
Are you leaving?
Is it because I didn't get into Tae Sung University?
That, too, but also because of the cough medicine incident.
I keep trying to do well, but I keep...
No matter how hard I think about it, I don't think I should be by your side.
I don't know what might happen because of me.
Don't hold me back.
I don't have any thought like that.
Huh?
Should I help you?
It seems heavy.
It's okay.
Alright then.
Take care!
Ah.
Is it for me?
Parang University?
Oh... Enrollment fee?
Eh, zero won?
The enrollment fee is zero won!
Undecided major?
Ah, this must be a mistake. It isn't for me.
It's addressed to "Baek Seung Jo".
Baek Seung Jo...?
Baek Seung Jo?! &lt;i&gt;Oh my...
Really?
You're really going to Parang University?
Why?
Who knows?
Because they begged me to go?
What?! &lt;i&gt;If you would enroll at our school, &lt;i&gt;we would offer everything and anything.
They're going to pay for me to study abroad, as well as combined masters and doctorate degrees.
If I stay within the school, they said they would even give me a tenured position there.
For me, they were really pissed asking why they should pick me.
But, even if it's Parang University, isn't priority admission the same for every university?
Through all of my life up until now,
I think I was the angriest last year.
I was anxious and pissed wondering what's going to happen today.
It was a complete mess.
Sorry.
But it was fun.
Falling asleep while taking the exam was fun.
Wondering what my score would be after taking the exam, that was new too.
Thanks to you, I experienced a lot of new things.
It was pretty exciting and fun.
So...
So?
So you're saying...
You're going because of me?
To Parang University?
It's not because of you, but because of me!
Just until I figure out what I want to do.
I want to live an exciting life until then.
I thought your grandmother said to live a fun life!
Right.
Well then...
See you.
Wait!
Then...
Does that mean I can stay here longer?
I won't be a pain anymore!
You won't?
Sure you won't.
I guess so... ...but I'll try!
I promise your life will be fun and exciting!
Thanks.
But...
So you've been feigning ignorance this whole time even knowing about Parang University?!
Even after seeing how I was dying of guilt?
Why?!
Because it was fun.
What?!
You don't like it?
If you don't like it, I can cancel it right now...
No, no, no!
I like it.
I'm happy.
I know.
See, I told you he had something in mind.
Parang University?
When did he apply here?
I'm sorry.
If my Ha Ni hadn't gotten into that accident, he would have just gone to Tae San University.
What's so great about Tae San University?
It's probably full of kids like Seung Jo.
Ha Ni and Seung Jo at the same university...
No matter how you see it, don't you think those two are a match made in heaven?
Match made in heaven...
Welcome!
Hello, Father!
I came again!
Oh, let me do it, I'll do it!
It's fine!
Look here, look here!
What chef does chores like this?!
Chef?
If it's what I think you came here to say, then just go on your way.
Oh no, today I came to give you this.
What's this?
Oh yes, it's safflower seeds.
Safflower seeds?
I hear this is the best for healing broken bones!
Even after one has taken off the cast, stuff like this needs to be eaten like crazy!
Please mix it with some water and feed it to Ha Ni.
Thanks.
Chef!
What are you doing?
Please don't be like this!
Can't you just take me in?!
Sixty years of tradition, So Pal Bok Noodles!
That tradition can't come to end, right?!
How many times do I have to tell you?
Do something you want to do.
Don't decide because of my Ha Ni!
What I want to do is this!
When I first ate your noodles... ...my heart felt like it was sinking!
Let go.
Father!
- Let go!
- Please, please!
Excuse me!
Yes, welcome!
Oh yes.
Is this... ...the place that sells some porridge that helps people get accepted into university?
It's just that I hear that... ...eating your porridge helps even the 90th place students get into Parang University.
By any chance, do you mean Bul Nak porridge?
Yes, that's right!
This is it, this is the place!
- Oh, this is wonderful!
- Oh, yes, welcome!
So this is where it was!
Hey, hurry and get up!
No sir!
I will not budge from this spot today, not until you take me in!
You little...
Your act is an obstruction of business!
Obstruction?
Oh, that won't do.
Excuse me, can we get some warm water here?
- Oh, yes, yes!
- Yes, yes!
It's fine, I'll do it!
Can we see a few menus?
Oh, yes!
Menu, menu, menu!
Oh, here they are!
Here you go.
You look so hardworking.
There's even pine mushroom and oyster chopped noodles!
This is the best time for oysters, you know.
The aroma of the ocean is embedded in them!
Such a youngster, but you're great at business.
- Then I'll have the oyster noodles.
- I want the Bul Nak porridge.
Alright, then one order of oyster noodles, and three Bul Nak porridges?
Got it!
Please wait just a bit!
One Chopped Noodles and three Bul Nak porridges!
Are you looking for something in particular?
I was just...
Where are the mp3s and digital cameras?
They're in that corner.
How nifty! &lt;i&gt;Brought to you by the PKer team @ www.viikii.net
There are so many things I want to buy for him.
It looks so nice.
It'll probably look really good on Seung Jo.
Thank you, boss!
I'll give it my all!
Do your best from now on.
Yes!
I'll do my best!
I'll be right there!
This tastes really good.
It's 6,200 Won.
($6.20)
Gosh.
Oh, you're here?
I'm home.
Oh good.
She's constantly late these days.
She's probably lazing around now that she's been accepted into university!
Where did you learn to talk in such a way!? &lt;i&gt;Brought to you by the PKer team @ www.viikii.net&lt;/i&gt;
Oh Ha Ni!
You've been staying out late these days.
Why?
Were you worried?
Worried?
Don't you know that my mom stays up late every day so that she can open the door for you?
I know.
But I have no choice.
What? Rice balls...
If it's 3,800 won (per hour) for 7 hours... ...it's 26,600 won.
It's 7,000 won.
I've received 10,000 won.
Your change is 3,000 won.
Come again.
Welcom...
How much is it?
It's 1,200 won.
Here.
Hey... Customer...
How much did you give me just now?
10,000 won.
I've received 10,000 won.
Excuse me...
Customer...
From here...
Please take 8,800 won.
What?
8,800 won?
Ah... Yes.
Goodbye.
Manager!
What?
Please take 8,800 won?!
Out of all those other convenience stores, why did he have to come to this one?
Well, it must be our destiny.
Anyways...
Where could I make money?
It shouldn't be too late either.
Yes!
[Tae Yang Chicken]
Ha Ni!
What to do?
You're going to have to go on a delivery again.
It's okay!
As long as you pay me, then it's fine.
It is here.
Ah good.
Ah stupid.
Why didn't I know while I was coming here?
Yes.
No...
I came already.
Yes, i am in front of the house.
Yes.
Who is it?
Hello, i am the chicken...
I am really busy now.
I'll just leave this here.
So could you bring it in?
Huh?
What about the money?
That's right!
The money!
You need to give it to me, the money.
Ah, what do i do!
Out of all those chicken places, why did he have to order from this one?
Our destiny must not be just some regular destiny.
Ah, Min Ah!
I can't get a hold of Joo Ri.
They said she left really early in the morning and her phone has been off all day.
Actually, after she found out we both got into Parang University, I haven't been able to talk or to get a hold of her.
So, that's why I came alone when you got in the accident.
Joo Ri, where are you?
Min Ah!
Yes.
Where did she go?
Where have we not gone yet?
- At school!
- At school!
Hurry up.
She is not here.
Let's go.
Hey!
Jong Joo Ri!
Oh my gosh!
I thought I was about to drop my liver! (saying for when you get surprised)
What's up with you Jung Joo Ri?
And your phone is off too.
What are you doing here alone?
You are busy...
Since you guys are college students.
Not yet.
We haven't graduated.
Sorry!
My mind was everywhere.
It is alright.
I said I was going to go to the academy (cram school) this morning and left.
I didn't want to.
But there wasn't anywhere for me to go but school.
You're going to retake your SATs?
My parents are telling me to retake them and try to get into even a 2 year college.
What will I do if I go to college?
It's just a waste of money.
Why don't they know their daughter?
Then, tell them that you're going to do what you want to do.
I have to know how to do something in order for me to tell them.
Why would you not (have something you know how to do)?
What is there?
You're the one that made me this hairstyle.
You are right!
You always tie my hair and pin it too.
That's right.
Our teacher did also recognize it.
- Of course!
- Right?
The best.
Okay.
I'm not going to retake them!
I'm not retaking the SATs!
It is also the end of the annoying stuff.
Colleges that are concerned only with names, this dirty world!
You dirty world that only makes it easy for the pretty girls!
Jung Joo Ri is beautiful.
Dok Go Min Ah is pretty too!
Anyways, congratulations to you both on going to college.
Ah embarrassing!
This isn't my style.
We know, we know!
So strange of you!
Don't do it. &lt;i&gt;What's the deal about life. You're filled with so many worries. &lt;i&gt;Change up that frustration. &lt;i&gt;A completely empty wallet. &lt;i&gt;You're drenched in despair. &lt;i&gt;I know how that feels. &lt;i&gt;But with your... &lt;i&gt;Heart afire! &lt;i&gt;Sometimes you have to face it head on. &lt;i&gt;Sometimes you've got to cry, that is youth. &lt;i&gt;Just kick it out. &lt;i&gt;Sometimes you have to face it head on. &lt;i&gt;Sometimes you've got to cry, that is youth. &lt;i&gt;That's what it is!
I'm not going to university.
Even if you wanted to, you couldn't go! &lt;i&gt; &lt;i&gt;
Ha Ni!
Baek Seung Jo, hurry and come down!
You know...
What?
Here!
What is it?
Just because I feel bad for a lot of things...
And I'm thankful for a lot of things too.
You could call it a graduation gift too.
You're going to do an all-in-one, is it?
Want to see?
What the hell is this?
It's a head massager.
It seems like you're constantly talking about how your head hurts.
Where did you buy something like this?
Definitely a gift like Oh Ha Ni.
You don't like it?
Want me to exchange it for something else?
You're going to be late to your graduation?
Why aren't you two coming down?
Oh my, what's this?
Is it a helmet?
It's a head massager.
Since Seung Jo uses his head a lot.
Oh this works as a neck massager as well.
It's a gift for Seung Jo?
Oh godness, you're so thoughtful.
Try it on Seung Jo!
I don't want to!
Who in the world wears things like this!
He's so mean.
Goodness, this looks expensive.
Where did you get the money?
I took on a part-time job.
So that's why you were late these days.
Oh my.
Mic test. 1. 2.
What are you going to do if you're freaking out already?
Guys, I can't breathe very well.
I've never been up on stage!
Oh gosh.
Our homeroom teacher put on a real show in order to have you accept on behalf of our class.
- Really?
- That's right.
Class 1's representative is Baek Seung Jo, and Class 7's is Oh Ha Ni.
So do a good job!
Don't go up there and fall over! Crashing all over the place!
Don't say such negative things.
Be careful.
Hey Baek Seung Jo.
I hear you got into Parang University.
Speak up.
What kind of intentions do you have?
Intentions?
That's right.
There are hundreds of universities.
But I hear you've got the skills to get into Taesan University even if you took the exams with your eyes closed.
So why the hell are you going to Parang University?
So I could see you react like this.
What?
You little! Till the very end I see!
Can everyone hear?
We will now be commencing with
Parang High School's graduation ceremony.
Ha Ni and Seung Jo?
Though there were SAT mysteries every year...
This year,
There were 2 events that were so absurd you couldn't really call it a mystery.
One of them is...
Class 7's Oh Ha Ni getting into Parang University.
The other one is that Class 1's Baek Seung Jo is also attending Parang University.
Does this make any sense?!
It doesn't make any sense!
Next is the speech from the representative of the graduating class.
Class 1's Baek Seung Jo.
Oliver Wendell Holmes once said this.
The great thing in the world...
Is not so much where we stand,
As in what direction we are moving.
Today we graduate.
After 3 years, this is how far we have come.
Once this chapter of your life ends, where will all of you go?
To the Chinese restaurant?
Family restaurants?
Though I joke about it,
Even I didn't know which direction I was supposed to go.
Actually no, I've still yet to find it.
But I found something out.
It's thanks to a grandmother whose face I've never even seen.
She said that I just need to have fun, and others need to be happy.
She said that's how to live life.
But as you all know, I don't have the personality to make others happy?
So for the time being, I'm planning on at least living a fun life.
Though I still don't know how to yet.
I hope for all of you out there, despite which direction your life is headed...
I hope that road is filled with fun.
Thank you. &lt;i&gt;Just have a fun life. &lt;i&gt;Have fun. &lt;i&gt;Fun? &lt;i&gt;My grandmother used to say it all the time. &lt;i&gt;Ha Ni, enjoy your life, have fun. &lt;i&gt;You have fun, and make sure others are happy. &lt;i&gt;She said living life like that is fine. &lt;i&gt;Fun?
Oh Ha Ni!
What?
Is Class 7's Oh Ha Ni not here?
Here! I'm here!
It's Ha Ni!
Along with Class 1's Baek Seung Jo...
Class 7's Oh Ha Ni...
They will be accepting the diplomas, On behalf of the graduating seniors of Parang High School.
Please come up to the podium.
Do you, Baek Seung Jo, take Oh Ha Ni to be your lawfully wedded wife,
Despite rain, snow, wind, and flowers?
Do you vow to love and cherish her?
I do.
Do you, Oh Ha Ni, take Baek Seung Jo to be your lawfully wedded husband, Despite...
Yes, I do!
Ha Ni, I promise too!
You're the only one for me!
I'm going to look onto just you until my dying days!
Who says?! I'm against it!
I'm totally against it!
Hey Seung Jo, you say something too! Tell him that you're totally against it too!
Is that Baek Seung Jo's mom?
Baek Seung Jo's got it rough too.
There's Oh Ha Ni, and his mom.
What are you doing?
Hurry and come down!
Oh gosh, Oh Ha Ni.
You were so funny today.
Seriously!
I told you, you were going to fall.
Oh goodness Ha Ni, I'm sorry.
I was just so worked up earlier on.
It's fine.
Did Eun Jo leave too?
Yeah.
He said I'm too embarassing.
What does it matter? Right? What's it matter?
It was totally like you, Oh Ha Ni.
- You think so? - That's right, if nothing happened you wouldn't be Oh Ha Ni.
Oh yea, but where is Seung Jo?
I told him I wanted to take pictures.
I want to start school again
And wear a school uniform like this.
Really? We're so tired of them.
Oh! &lt;i&gt;Brought to you by the PKer team @ www.viikii.net &lt;/i&gt;
That's so cool!
That's what I'm talking about!
That's what high school graduation is all about.
Oh, where is Seung Jo?
Hurry up and find him.
Oh, he's over there.
Excuse me,
Looks like they want to take pictures.
See you later.
Aw, poor things.
Ha! It's Hong Jang Mi.
Seung Jo Oppa, let's take a picture.
Teacher, Wait a moment please.
Hurry!
Ready?
1, 2, 3.
Hey, Ha Ni.
Go over there, let's take a picture quickly!
Yes?
I don't want to.
I'm scared.
Scared?
I'm just saying you should show her how it's done.
Baek Seung Jo!
Hurry.
What?
You want to take a picture too?
Yeah.
Are you saying that you want me to take a picture with you now?
No.
It doesn't.
Sorry.
Oh Ha Ni.
Come here.
Is this good enough?
It's fine.
Stay like that.
Ah, so pretty!
Thank you.
I'm going to take it now!
Customer, how much money have you given me?
2,
Please take 8,800 won from here.
3!
That's right Ha Ni!
Today I'll make a night you'll never be able to forget.
Aigoo!
Come on in!
Please come this way!
Ah what's this?!
Why are class 7 here?
I really hate this!
We hate you too!
Ah Ahjushi!
How could you do this?
You're from the same school so it's okay if you have fun together!
Have a great time!
We don't get along with them!
Even on graduation day...
Hurry, hurry!
Ha Ni.
These are my feeling for you. Do you understand? Listen well.
Hey Baek Seung Jo!
Why are you here?
It seems like they got everything ready, so let's just stay here.
Okay! Great!
Oh, oh, oh!
Urgh! Doing as he pleases!
Urgh!
There is nothing we can do! Let's just start.
Don't you look at us! &lt;i&gt; You are my life's navigation
Bong Joon Gu! &lt;i&gt;You guide me through the road I have to take. &lt;i&gt; Please let me know about life's directions, speed &lt;i&gt; and locations. &lt;i&gt; If it gets too hard and I start shedding tears, &lt;i&gt; please hold me tightly. &lt;i&gt; if I get tired and fall, &lt;i&gt; Please reach out to me and hold my hand. &lt;i&gt; I love you, I love you, you are the one I love, I love you! &lt;i&gt; My life's navigation.
Boong Joon Gu &lt;i&gt;BulNak porridge for the examinees.
Good-bye!
Sir!
Aigoo!
Congratulations!
Okay, right away!
Wait a moment!
I'm coming!
Did you enjoy your meal?
Ha Ni, you must be happy.
I am at the gathering now.
Oh really? That's really good!
Oh, right now?
Oh really?!
Okay, I understand. I'll leave it to you.
Yes.
That's right. I should look ahead into the future. Today's not the end.
Let's go!
Kids.
I am very proud of you. Over the course of last year, you have stayed first and...
You guys, you don't waste your lives on futile exams and colleges, all of you are bright and talented in your own way freedom of souls, personal best, that stuff is all just intimidation that's why you kids...
Intimidated? yes?
I didn't mean to point out class 7. Why...did you feel intimidated?
Sending students who are smart to college isn't special enough to boast about the happiness lies when a student on the bottom gets admitted to Parang University. Do you know how worthwhile it is?
Do you know how sad it feels to have a student flying sky high get crumpled up in Parang University?
Teacher, I told you, that's not it. it's not because of her
My life in the dumps, because of a stupid girl like her,
That's an insult. stupid? troublesome- idiot
Baek Seung Jo!
You're right, it's true that I have been a little troublesome to you
Just a little? A lot.
She really is an idiot.
I was taught to never boast about what you didn't earn just because you were born smart, doesn't give you the right to look down on other people nobody is putting anyone down, those people just put themselves down You call that an inferiority complex. Bad jerk.
A jerk that doesn't even have one grain of human feelings.
Rude... Icy... BAD LUCK!!!
But then why do you love that rude, icy, bad luck jerk?
What?
You said that you're happy and that you liked it.
Even in your textbook, it was filled with my name.
Therefore, could you have even studied?
Really~ you want to take it that far, huh? In that case, I have something in mind too You are prepared for this?
Everyone! I present to you little Baek Seung Jo!
Oh Ha Ni!
Hey! What's this?!
Totally cute!
Did you really think I'd only have one picture? And you call yourself a genius?
You, come with me.
It hurts!
I said it hurts!
What do you think you're doing?!
What?
What are you going to do?
So you spilled the beans, huh?
Even if you try to scare me, I'm not scared!!
The feelings I had for you...
You made it the target of ridicule in front of all those kids.
I was getting revenge.
I want to quit now.
I don't want to like you anymore.
Can you do that?
I can!
Baek Seung Jo, your temper...
I've figured out how tiring it is.
With graduation, my crush will also come to an end.
I'm going to stop.
You're going to forget me?
Yeah.
I'll forget someone like you, and at college I'll meet someone...
Then try to forget me. &lt;i&gt;I don't know from when it was. &lt;i&gt;Since the moment I saw you. &lt;i&gt;Every minute, every second I think of you.
Looks like something else. &lt;i&gt;What are you doing Merong. (sticking tongue out) &lt;i&gt;Where could you be right now. &lt;i&gt;Ooh baby. &lt;i&gt;Even when I look here and there. &lt;i&gt;Even this and that. &lt;i&gt;I keep on liking you that I'm about to go crazy.
K... kiss?
Did I... with Baek Seung Jo...
Baek Seung Jo kissed me. &lt;i&gt;I want to know only you and love you. &lt;i&gt;Although spending time in love can be a waste, &lt;i&gt;I don't want to do anything without you. &lt;i&gt;Everyday. &lt;i&gt;When I open my eyes in the morning, I want to see you. &lt;i&gt;Now I can't live a day without you. &lt;i&gt;I want to hear that you love me too. &lt;i&gt;I love you everyday. &lt;i&gt;I love only you.
The two of us.
Ha Ni!
You said you have to go to school today!
Ah that's right.
What should I do if we see each other?
How awkward.
What should I say?
You already got up.
Ah come on.
So thick(headed).
Thick?
Can you say that between people who kissed?
What is this?
I was the only one who didn't know what to do.
I'm like a dummy.
I was wanting to see you kids in your high school uniforms as high school students again.
But seeing you guys today, it's like seeing you as college students.
What's wrong with me?
Ha Ni ah.
What do you think about Seung Jo's hairstyle?
After he said he wouldn't go, I forced him to go and get a perm.
What do you think?
It turned out good, huh?
Yes, it looks good on him.
See, I told you it looked okay.
I ate well. I'll be leaving first.
Why are you going already?
There's still time.
Hey!
You should go with Ha Ni.
Oppa!
After saying to go together, he just leaves.
Then why did he come to the same school as me?
No...
Aigoo, what are you talking to yourself about?
Did you get a perm?
Yeah.
Beauty students get a 50% discount.
How does it look?
It looks like you're wearing a helmet.
Yeah, you're right.
It looks like I'm wearing a helmet.
Hey take it off.
Take it off.
No, it's pretty! Considering that it's done by only half price. Hey when is Dok Go Min Ah coming?
I'm here.
Are you Min Ah?
What's wrong?
Hey, I saw you earlier.
But I couldn't recognize you!
What's up... you look so cool!
You liked reading animation books so much... it looks like you jumped right out of one of them.
You're really pretty.
You like it?
Yeah.
Should I retake the SATs?
You threw away all your books.
What is it Oh Ha Ni...
Something happened didn't it?
What is it?
Hurry up and tell us.
What?
Why do you keep covering your mouth?
Actually...
I kissed.
What did you say?
WHAT!!!
KlSSED???
When?
Where?
How was it?
You're being too loud.
If you guys kissed, doesn't that make you guys a couple?
But... what should I call it?
It was like he was playing around.
What are you talking about?
It's a kiss, a kiss.
You said you did it?
I'm going to tell everyone.
Hey!
Oh Ha Ni, you have some good luck.
You like it, you liked it didn't you?
Are you alright Ha Ni-ya?
Are you ok?
Yes.
Are you okay?
You didn't get hit, did you?
Yes.
I'm sorry.
Are you a new student?
Yes.
Welcome.
Pardon?
Where is it?
It must be here.
Oh.
Isn't this the car from earlier?
Maybe.
That girl was super pretty.
Pretty?
I saw her up close.
Her hair was really nice and thick.
"New student?
Welcome!"
She must be an upperclassman
Yeah.
What grade could she be in?
3rd year?
That's enough.
Stop talking about the girl and let's hurry.
Hey, don't you have to go meet your husband? yyaa~ husband!?!
You're coming later, right?
No, I don't think I'll be able to go.
He's over there.
Oh Ha Ni!
Hi!
Hi.
Hi.

There's currently over a thousand TED Talks on the TED website.
And I guess many of you here think that this is quite fantastic, except for me, I don't agree with this.
I think we have a situation here.
Because if you think about it, 1,000 TED Talks, that's over 1,000 ideas worth spreading.
How on earth are you going to spread a thousand ideas?
Even if you just try to get all of those ideas into your head by watching all those thousand TED videos, it would actually currently take you over 250 hours to do so.
And I did a little calculation of this.
The damage to the economy for each one who does this is around $15,000.
So having seen this danger to the economy, I thought, we need to find a solution to this problem.
Here's my approach to it all.
If you look at the current situation, you have a thousand TED Talks.
Each of those TED Talks has an average length of about 2,300 words.
Now take this together, and you end up with 2.3 million words of TED Talks, which is about three Bibles-worth of content.
(Laughter) The obvious question here is, does a TED Talk really need 2,300 words?
Isn't there something shorter?
I mean, if you have an idea worth spreading, surely you can put it into something shorter than 2,300 words.
The only question is, how short can you get?
What's the minimum amount of words you would need to do a TED Talk?
While I was pondering this question, I came across this urban legend about Ernest Hemingway, who allegedly said that these six words here:
"For sale: baby shoes, never worn," were the best novel he had ever written.
And I also encountered a project called Six-Word Memoirs where people were asked, take your whole life and please sum this up into six words, such as these here:
"Found true love, married someone else." Or "Living in existential vacuum; it sucks."
I actually like that one.
So if a novel can be put into six words and a whole memoir can be put into six words, you don't need more than six words for a TED Talk.
We could have been done by lunch here.
(Laughter) And if you did this for all thousand TED Talks, you would get from 2.3 million words down to 6,000.
So I thought this was quite worthwhile.
So I started asking all my friends, please take your favorite TED Talk and put that into six words.
So here are some of the results that I received.
I think they're quite nice.
For example, Dan Pink's talk on motivation, which was pretty good, if you haven't seen it:
"Drop carrot. Drop stick. Bring meaning."
It's what he's basically talking about in those 18,5 minutes. Or some even included references to the speakers, such as Nathan Myhrvold's speaking style, or the one of Tim Ferriss, which might be considered a bit strenuous at times.
The challenge here is, if I try to systematically do this, I would probably end up with a lot of summaries, but not with many friends in the end.
So I had to find a different method, preferably involving total strangers.
And luckily, there's a website for that, called Mechanical Turk, which is a website where you can post tasks that you don't want to do yourself, such as "Please summarize this text for me in six words."
And I didn't allow any low-cost countries to work on this, but I found out I could get a six-word summary for just 10 cents, which I think is a pretty good price.
Even then, unfortunately, it's not possible to summarize each TED Talk individually.
Because if you do the math, you have a thousand TED Talks, you pay 10 cents each; you have to do more than one summary for each of those talks, because some of them will probably be, or are, really bad.
So I would end up paying hundreds of dollars.
So I thought of a different way, by thinking, well, the talks revolve around certain themes.
So what if I don't let people summarize individual TED Talks to six words, but give them 10 TED Talks at the same time and say, "Please do a six-word summary for that one."
I would cut my costs by 90 percent.
So for $60, I could summarize a thousand TED Talks into just 600 summaries, which would actually be quite nice.
Some of you might actually right now be thinking, it's downright crazy to have 10 TED Talks summarized into just six words. But it's actually not, because there's an example by statistics professor Hans Rosling.
I guess many of you have seen one or more of his talks.
He's got eight talks online, and those can basically be summed up into just four words, because that's all he's basically showing us, our intuition is really bad.
He always proves us wrong.
So people on the Internet, some didn't do so well.
And when I asked them to summarize the 10 TED Talks at the same time, some took the easy route out.
They just had some general comment.
There were others -- and I found this quite cheeky --
They used their six words to talk back to me and ask me if I'd been too much on Google lately. (Laughter)
And finally also, I never understood this, some people really came up with their own version of the truth.
I don't know any TED Talk that contains this.
But, oh well. In the end, however, and this is really amazing, for each of those 10 TED Talk clusters that I submitted,
I actually received meaningful summaries.
Here are some of my favorites.
For example, for the TED Talks about food, someone summed this up into:
"Food shaping body, brains and environment," which I think is pretty good. Or happiness:
"Striving toward happiness = moving toward unhappiness." So here I was.
I had started out with a thousand TED Talks and I had 600 six-word summaries for those.
Actually, it sounded nice in the beginning, but when you look at 600 summaries, it's quite a lot, it's a huge list.
(Laughter) So I thought, I probably have to take this one step further here and create summaries of the summaries, and this is exactly what I did.
So I took the 600 summaries that I had, put them into nine groups according to the ratings that the talks had originally received on TED.com and asked people to do summaries of those.
Again, there were some misunderstandings.
For example, when I had a cluster of all the "Beautiful" talks, someone thought I was just trying to find the ultimate pick-up line.
But in the end, amazingly, again, people were able to do it.
For example, all the courageous TED Talks:
"People dying" or "People suffering" was also one,
"with easy solutions around."
Or the recipe for the ultimate jaw-dropping TED Talk: "Flickr photos of intergalactic classical composer."
I mean that's the essence of it all.
Now I had my nine groups, but, I mean, it's already quite a reduction.
But of course, once you are that far, you're not really satisfied.
I wanted to go all the way, all the way down the distillery, starting out with a thousand TED Talks.
I wanted to have a thousand TED Talks summarized into just six words -- which would be a 99.9997 percent reduction in content.
And I would only pay $99.50 -- so stay even below $100 for it.
So I had 50 overall summaries done.
This time I paid 25 cents because I thought the task was a bit harder.
And unfortunately, when I first received the answers -- and here, you'll see six of the answers -- I was a bit disappointed.
Because I think you'll agree, they all summarize some aspect of TED, but to me, they felt a bit bland, or they just had a certain aspect of TED in them.
So I was almost ready to give up when one night, I played around with these sentences and found out that there's actually a beautiful solution in here.
So here it is, a crowd-sourced, six-word summary of a thousand TED Talks at the value of $99.50:
"Why the worry?
I'd rather wonder." Thank you very much.
(Applause)
I'm a savant, or more precisely, a high-functioning autistic savant.
It's a rare condition.
And rarer still when accompanied, as in my case, by self-awareness and a mastery of language.
Very often when I meet someone and they learn this about me, there's a certain kind of awkwardness.
I can see it in their eyes.
They want to ask me something.
And in the end, quite often, the urge is stronger than they are and they blurt it out:
"If I give you my date of birth, can you tell me what day of the week I was born on?"
(Laughter)
Or they mention cube roots or ask me to recite a long number or long text.
I hope you'll forgive me if I don't perform a kind of one-man savant show for you today.
I'm going to talk instead about something far more interesting than dates of birth or cube roots -- a little deeper and a lot closer, to my mind, than work.
I want to talk to you briefly about perception.
When he was writing the plays and the short stories that would make his name, Anton Chekhov kept a notebook in which he noted down his observations of the world around him -- little details that other people seem to miss.
Every time I read Chekhov and his unique vision of human life, I'm reminded of why I too became a writer.
In my books, I explore the nature of perception and how different kinds of perceiving create different kinds of knowing and understanding.
Here are three questions drawn from my work.
Rather than try to figure them out, I'm going to ask you to consider for a moment the intuitions and the gut instincts that are going through your head and your heart as you look at them.
For example, the calculation: can you feel where on the number line the solution is likely to fall?
Or look at the foreign word and the sounds: can you get a sense of the range of meanings that it's pointing you towards?
And in terms of the line of poetry, why does the poet use the word hare rather than rabbit?
I'm asking you to do this because I believe our personal perceptions, you see, are at the heart of how we acquire knowledge.
Aesthetic judgments, rather than abstract reasoning, guide and shape the process by which we all come to know what we know.
I'm an extreme example of this.
My worlds of words and numbers blur with color, emotion and personality.
As Juan said, it's the condition that scientists call synesthesia, an unusual cross-talk between the senses.
Here are the numbers one to 12 as I see them -- every number with its own shape and character.
One is a flash of white light.
Six is a tiny and very sad black hole.
The sketches are in black and white here, but in my mind they have colors.
Three is green.
Four is blue.
Five is yellow.
I paint as well. And here is one of my paintings.
It's a multiplication of two prime numbers.
Three-dimensional shapes and the space they create in the middle creates a new shape, the answer to the sum.
What about bigger numbers?
Well you can't get much bigger than Pi, the mathematical constant.
It's an infinite number -- literally goes on forever.
In this painting that I made of the first 20 decimals of Pi, I take the colors and the emotions and the textures and I pull them all together into a kind of rolling numerical landscape.
But it's not only numbers that I see in colors.
Words too, for me, have colors and emotions and textures.
And this is an opening phrase from the novel "Lolita." And Nabokov was himself synesthetic.
And you can see here how my perception of the sound L helps the alliteration to jump right out.
Another example: a little bit more mathematical.
And I wonder if some of you will notice the construction of the sentence from "The Great Gatsby."
There is a procession of syilables -- wheat, one; prairies, two;
lost Swede towns, three -- one, two, three.
And this effect is very pleasant on the mind, and it helps the sentence to feel right.
Let's go back to the questions I posed you a moment ago. 64 multiplied by 75.
If some of you play chess, you'll know that 64 is a square number, and that's why chessboards, eight by eight, have 64 squares.
So that gives us a form that we can picture, that we can perceive.
What about 75?
Well if 100, if we think of 100 as being like a square, 75 would look like this.
So what we need to do now is put those two pictures together in our mind -- something like this. 64 becomes 6,400.
And in the right-hand corner, you don't have to calculate anything.
Four across, four up and down -- it's 16.
So what the sum is actually asking you to do is 16, 16, 16.
That's a lot easier than the way that the school taught you to do math, I'm sure.
It's 16, 16, 16, 48, 4,800 -- 4,800, the answer to the sum.
Easy when you know how.
(Laughter)
The second question was an Icelandic word.
I'm assuming there are not many people here who speak Icelandic.
So let me narrow the choices down to two.
Hnugginn: is it a happy word, or a sad word?
What do you say?
Okay.
Some people say it's happy.
Most people, a majority of people, say sad.
And it actually means sad.
(Laughter)
Why do, statistically, a majority of people say that a word is sad, in this case, heavy in other cases?
In my theory, language evolves in such a way that sounds match, correspond with, the subjective, with the personal, intuitive experience of the listener.
Let's have a look at the third question.
It's a line from a poem by John Keats.
Words, like numbers, express fundamental relationships between objects and events and forces that constitute our world.
It stands to reason that we, existing in this world, should in the course of our lives absorb intuitively those relationships.
And poets, like other artists, play with those intuitive understandings.
In the case of hare, it's an ambiguous sound in English.
It can also mean the fibers that grow from a head.
And if we think of that --
let me put the picture up -- the fibers represent vulnerability.
They yield to the slightest movement or motion or emotion.
So what you have is an atmosphere of vulnerability and tension.
The hare itself, the animal -- not a cat, not a dog, a hare -- why a hare?
Because think of the picture -- not the word, the picture.
The overlong ears, the overlarge feet, helps us to picture, to feel intuitively, what it means to limp and to tremble.
So in these few minutes, I hope I've been able to share a little bit of my vision of things and to show you that words can have colors and emotions, numbers, shapes and personalities.
The world is richer, vaster than it too often seems to be.
I hope that I've given you the desire to learn to see the world with new eyes.
Thank you.

A Visit from Saint Nicholos by Clement Clarke Moore
Twas the night before Christmas, when all through the house
Not a creature was stirring, not even a mouse;
The stockings were hung by the chimney with care,
In hopes that St. Nicholas soon would be there;
The children were nestled all snug in their beds,
While visions of sugar-plums danced in their heads;
And mamma in her kerchief, and I in my cap,
Had just settled our brains for a long winter's nap--
When out on the lawn there rose such a clatter,
I sprang from my bed to see what was the matter,
Away to the window I flew like a flash,
Tore open the shutters and threw up the sash.
The moon, on the breast of the new-fallen snow,
Gave a lustre of mid-day to objects below;
When, what to my wondering eyes should appear,
But a miniature sleigh, and eight tiny rein-deer,
With a little old driver, so lively and quick,
I knew in a moment it must be St. Nick.
More rapid than eagles his coursers they came,
And he whistled, and shouted, and called them by name;
"Now, Dasher! now, Dancer! now, Prancer and Vixen!
On!
Comet, on!
Cupid, on!
Dunder and Blitzen--
To the top of the porch, to the top of the wall!
Now, dash away, dash away, dash away all!"
As dry leaves that before the wild hurricane fly,
When they meet with an obstacle, mount to the sky,
So, up to the house-top the coursers they flew,
With a sleigh full of toys--and St. Nicholas too.
And then in a twinkling I heard on the roof,
The prancing and pawing of each little hoof.
As I drew in my head, and was turning around,
Down the chimney St. Nicholas came with a bound.
He was dressed all in fur from his head to his foot,
And his clothes were all tarnished with ashes and soot;
A bundle of toys he had flung on his back,
And he looked like a peddler just opening his pack;
His eyes how they twinkled! his dimples how merry!
His cheeks were like roses, his nose like a cherry;
His droll little mouth was drawn up like a bow,
And the beard on his chin was as white as the snow;
The stump of a pipe he held tight in his teeth,
And the smoke, it encircled his head like a wreath.
He had a broad face, and a little round belly
That shook when he laughed, like a bowl full of jelly.
He was chubby and plump--a right jolly old elf;
And I laughed when I saw him in spite of myself.
A wink of his eye, and a twist of his head,
Soon gave me to know I had nothing to dread.
He spoke not a word, but went straight to his work,
And filled all the stockings; then turned with a jerk,
And laying his finger aside of his nose,
And giving a nod, up the chimney he rose.
He sprang to his sleigh, to his team gave a whistle,
And away they all flew like the down of a thistle;
But I heard him exclaim, ere he drove out of sight,
"Merry Christmas to all, and to all a good night!"
"Write a mathematical expression which corresponds to x time y minus a times b times c."
I could either write that as x √ó y, or I could just write that as xy.
And from that, I'm going to subtract a times b times c.
So: minus a times ...
And I could write it a [asterisk] b [asterisk] c.
I could write it like that.
Or I could just write -abc.
And you can see how it's being interpreted by the computer right over here.
It understands that I'm saying x times y minus a times b times c (or xy - abc).

Episode 2
- &lt;i&gt;Baek Seung Jo, why aren't you coming in? &lt;i&gt;Ha Ni, come in quickly.
Why did you come out of that house?
Because it's my house.
- You said it's your...
Should I carry that?
Ah, I remember now. Even if you're homeless, you don't want my help.
Oh Seung Jo, come here.
- Hello.
- He's our eldest.
I've heard so much already. I feel like we've been together for so long.
After watching the news, she's the one who wanted to look for you guys.
So we could live together.
That's why we called the broadcasting studio immediately.
Oh, really?
Thank you.
He would always tell me that he was indebted to you and that he had to pay you back some day.
Oh, there's no need to...
But, what took you so long?
Don't you two know each other? Both of you are in the same year.
Ah well, he's already pretty well known.
I guess.
He is pretty good at studying.
But, the others don't like him, do they?
What?
His personality is a little weird.
Always arrogant and looking down.
Look at him now.
He doesn't have any girls, does he?
Well...
Oh.
Baek Eun Jo, you haven't slept yet?
I was studying.
Why?
Then you might become like your brother.
Say hello.
He's our second child.
A bit young, isn't he?
He's in fourth grade.
Hello, I am Baek Eun Jo.
He's quite good looking.
He must've got it from his mother.
You must be so lucky.
Really?
Say hello to noona, too.
Ha Ni Noona. Oh Ha Ni.
Hi.
You're not greeting her?
I don't want to.
Why?
She looks dumb.
I'm sorry.
He must be going through puberty.
No, it's okay.
Why would she be dumb?
She's very good at studying.
Really?
Then...
What does that mean?
It's Chinese.
I see you're studying Chinese characters. Let's see.
This is for sixth grade.
Oh.
"Han Woo Choong Dong." You don't know what it means?
That's right. "Han Woo Choong Dong."
The meaning of this... &lt;I&gt;What? &lt;i&gt;What?
So,
"Han Woo" (Korean beef). You know how Korean beef is tasty, but is really expensive?
So, you have no money... you have no pocket money, but...
"Choong Dong." (urge)
You have an urge to eat Korean beef.
So in other words, you want something beyond your means.
That's it.
Is that true?
It means you have the urge to eat Korean beef?
"Han" means sweaty. "Woo" means cow.
–¢–æ make an ox sweat by pulling the wagon with the books, or to fill a house to the rafters with books.
In other words, it means "an immense number of books."
Aren't you stupid?
Baek Eun Jo, you have no manners.
I hate stupid people the most. &lt;i&gt;I've been rejected by both siblings.
I don't want to. I won't.
Tada!
I decorated it according to my taste, but I don't know if you will like it.
Oh my... You did all of this for me?
Yes.
Why?
You don't like it?
No.
It's so pretty. It's like a princess' bedroom.
Right?
This is also a princess' bed.
Hurry and try it out.
You know, I had so much fun decorating this room!
I really wanted to have a daughter so badly.
Decorating a room like this together and sharing pretty things.
And when she's older, to travel together.
However, I could only give birth to boys, so it's been really boring.
Let's go shopping and watch movies together. Okay?
Yes.
It's going to be so much fun!
Ah, also...
Here, a gift.
Since you lost your house, you must have no shoes left. Am I right?
Try them on.
It's pretty...
I'm causing you so much trouble that I don't know what to do.
Eh!
What trouble?
I was very happy to buy this.
Is the size a bit too big?
No, it's very comfortable.
I really like it.
Thank you.
Even the words you say are pretty!
Just become my daughter.
Oh! You brought it?
Good.
Now, you must be very tired. Have a good rest, okay?
Yes...
I'm very grateful for everything.
I'll see you tomorrow morning!
Yes...
Good night! Yes.
Seung Jo, good night.
This room was originally... ...Eun Jo's room.
Ah...
But thanks to someone here... Eun Jo's bed and desk...
My room is so crammed.
I'm sorry.
If you're sorry... ...won't you stop it now?
You've been annoying these past few days.
- I'm telling you not to make a big fuss at school. - Make a big fuss?
Don't worry.
If the news of us living together gets out, I'll be more affected by it than you.
What do you mean "living together"?
Weren't you the one who came to live in my house?
I'm going to wash up first.
You're dead.
You made me bleed.
I regret it.
I didn't think of going so far.
However, I can't help it either.
Ahhh!
That stupid jerk!
Damn it, damn it! Really!
I really hate smart guys like you!
Really?
So embarrassing!
Ah!
Why did he show up right then!
The toilet seat is warm.
What do I do?
To be so close we're using the same bathroom!
Did he hear me?
He's right next door.
Ah my tummy hurts!
I can't even poop because I'm scared I might make a sound.
They seem really close!
Aigoo, Oh Ha Ni.
You're still not back to your senses?
He said he doesn't like you.
He told you not to bother him.
Ah, yes. &lt;i&gt;I can't believe it! &lt;i&gt;I'm having breakfast with Baek Seung Jo! &lt;i&gt;So he's having toast and jam? &lt;i&gt;Geniuses eat jam. &lt;i&gt;This is so surreal. &lt;i&gt;By any chance, could this be a dream? &lt;i&gt;He won't be looking anymore, right?
Aigoo! You must have choked on your food.
Here, drink water.
Are you alright?
Yes, I'm fine.
She's dumb just like I expected.
- Baek Eun Jo! - Watch it!
Hey, Ha Ni, are you okay?
Hey, give me some more soup. It's so delicious!
It's really good.
Your Guksu (noodles) restaurant is doing well, isn't it?
You have a lot of costumers, right?
Ah, yes... A lot of regular customers come over.
But you know, starting tomorrow you should sleep more, you go to work late anyway.
I'm done eating.
I'll be getting up first.
Dear, how can you do that?
Ha Ni has to go with you.
Hey!
She doesn't even know her way to school.
Me too.
Hey!
Why are you leaving already?
Eat some more.
Hey, Ha Ni!
Hurry!
Ah, yes!
I'll be going to school now!
- Bye!
- Bye!
Slow down!
How could you just stop so suddenly?
It's just for today.
What?
Walking to school together.
If someone sees us... ...it would end up being bothersome again.
I got it.
Don't tell anyone about it.
I won't!
At school, act like you don't even know me.
I said I got it!
Let's walk separately.
Stupid jerk!
STUPlD JERK!
To think that I've liked a jerk like him for three years!
What a waste of my tears. &lt;i&gt;Brought to you by the PKer team @ www.viki.com&lt;/i&gt;
What are you daydreaming about?
None of your business.
What?
Why are you waiting for me, when you told me to walk separately?
Who's waiting?
You go in the front.
Why?
Ah! What!?
Why do you keep changing your mind?
Because you're short.
Isn't it hard to follow me around?
Don't blame me when you get to school late, and just go in front of me.
I'll just follow you from behind.
Let's see here...
This one.
What the heck?
Why are you all swollen?
Where's the syilabus for the next midterm exam?
Would we have any reason to know anything about that?
Will you not say "we"?
Do you know it?
No, I don't. Don't worry.
I'll study really hard, so that our pride, will be restored.
- You're looking up the word "pride", right? - Yeah.
Let's see.
Ha Ni!
Good morning.
Bong Joon Gu.
Greet us too.
Did you sleep well last night?
How did you like your father's friend's house?
Huh?
Yeah, it's great.
Oh, where is it?
Huh?
Huh?
Is it far?
No...
Two subway stops away.
No, about three subway stops away.
I got it! Let's go together later.
Why?
Does it make sense that a guy doesn't know where his girl lives?
Ah!
Was that a punch or a kick?!
Why? Do you want to be kicked too?
Hey!
Hey!
Move!
Ha!
Jung Ju Ri...
You again?
I told you that if you're going to do people's hair, do it at home! Is school a hair salon to you?
I'm sorry, Teacher.
Dryer, pins, perm roll...
You were just totally prepared.
What about your books?
I put all my books in my locker.
I'm sorry... I'll never bring them again.
Did you just cut her hair?
Yes, ma'am.
Just on the back.
Here...
Do something about this here, or just curl it.
Yes.
Oh my, oh my, teacher.
Your hair is half curly.
Oh my, how'd you know? I straightened it myself.
Ah, Teach, you can tell by your temples.
Where? Here?
Yes, if you look here, it's slightly curly.
After washing your hair you should do it just a little bit towards the inside.
- Like this? - Yes.
Ahh!
Just the inside.
TEACHER SONG GANG Yl!
I don't even know what it is that I don't know. &lt;i&gt;[Special Study Hall]
One... two...
Three!
Wow, that study hall must be really good.
The air conditioner is pretty strong.
Huh!
Everyone has their own computers too.
And it even has soundproof walls! &lt;i&gt;[Just Being Alive is Happiness]
If you're not going to study, why are you even there?
Seung Jo.
Seung Jo.
Aigoo, aigoo.
What a flirt!
Thank you!
I'm envious.
She's pretty and smart. 1... 2... 3...
Three steps.
Is it far?
It's far...
Are you studying here?
That's right!
Why? Are you scared?
If you're going to carry me, you better start working out.
Your study hall... ...looked very nice.
With the computers and soundproof walls...
What cheapskates.
Even if you say that, it doesn't sound like the truth.
What's he talking about?
It sounds like an inferiority complex.
Aren't you going home?
What!?
You're saying you want to go together?
Ha Ni!
Oh...but!
Wait (downstairs).
You were here?
I looked for you for a long time.
Oh!?
Did that guy say something again?
Huh?
No, oh hey, give me my backpack.
Oh no, it's okay.
This is for guys to carry.
Let's go!
Hey!
Ha Ni, sit here.
Aren't you hungry?
Should we get off and eat something?
Come on, let's go eat something, alright?
We're almost at our stop.
I said it's okay. I'll just keeping carrying it.
Give it, it looks embarassing.
Oh, it's really okay...
Oh! I have to get off.
Ha Ni!
Oh Joon Gu, what do I do?
I'm sorry!
Have a safe trip!
Thank you!
Take care.
Why didn't you guys come back together?
I'm sure she'll be here soon.
She's not very familar with the place yet.
Recently, there's been strange people around this neighborhood.
Oh Ha Ni is the strangest person here.
You come over here!
Hm! Come over here, you need a spanking!
Hey!
Baek Eun Jo.
Man, what a bother!
That cheapskate...
He left even though I told him to wait for me.
I even took a taxi.
Man, I should've just asked the taxi driver to drive me all the way home.
Made me spend all my allowance.
Don't do it!
Don't do it!
If you open it, I won't look!
I'm going to close my eyes.
Then it wouldn't matter.
Aye...
Pervert!
Pervert!
Stop it!
Stop it!
No, you can't!
That was a present.
Mister!
Hurry up and give it to me!
I said that was a present!
It's not like you're going to wear it!
Just have a look!
Then I'll give it back to you!
Man, I'm really tired.
I don't want to!!!
How far are you going to go?
Just once!
I beg you, please.
Without closing your eyes!
It's only going to take a second!
Really it's just once, right?
Really just once.
Then you'll give me my shoe back?
Of course, I'll return it. How would I use this?
Fine.
Fine?...
You said you're fine with it?
Since you asked nicely... ...but you MUST return the shoe to me.
Of course, very well.
I'm a person who keeps his promises.
You... ...you can't close your eyes because then that's cheating.
Okay.
I'm a person who keeps her promises too.
Alright.
Wait a second!
What?
Let me prepare myself.
Fine. Then prepare yourself.
Go ahead.
Preparing for that long isn't good.
Let's do it!
1... 2... 3...
Sir, forgive me!
Just this once?
Please forgive me, just this once?
I just started doing this.
I've registered on a forum and it's only my second time on the field.
Please don't report me, I have a family... ...and I have a kid.
Just this once, if you forgive me I swear it will never happen again.
Sir, eh?
Then go straight home right now.
Thank you, sir!
What the?
What?
You shouldn't take this with you.
You're right.
Goodbye.
Were you looking for me?
Because you were worried?
As if!
I bought this.
But how did you come right on time?
It was because of my bad luck.
Anyway, you...
In a situation like that, people would give up the shoe. How could...
Because they were a present from your mom.
Today was the first time I wore them!
Yeah, but still...
What did you buy?
Ah!
It looks good.
Can I have some?
My throat is parched from the run.
It's melted.
Is it cause of the heat?
Hey!
Is that the Big Dipper?
One, two...
Hey, can you hear those crickets crying?
They're not crying.
Stupid girls... ...even if they have good taste,
I hate them.
Come to your senses, Oh Ha Ni.
Don't you have any pride?
Right.
Let's study!
Let's study and show them how it's done.
Math.
Let's start with math.
Okay...
It's the global age, so let's start with English.
Aigoo!
Let's start with our native language (Korean).
Ugh!
What is this talking about?
I don't get it!
I don't know!
I've learned all of this?
There's no way...
Yes?
Here.
Have this to eat.
Thank you!
Come on in.
You're studying hard. Hehe. I'm just sitting around.
Make sure you take breaks in between.
I've always wanted to do something like this.
Making late night snacks and saying that you should take breaks while studying.
Now I feel like the mother of a high school senior.
Seung Jo doesn't eat late night snacks?
It's not that, but rather Seung Jo doesn't study at all.
He doesn't study?
He's already sleeping.
But he always gets perfect scores.
He must be a real genius.
Is that so?
What's the use of getting perfect scores? He's no fun at all.
Do you have a blog?
Of course!
I'm a power blogger.
Ehh!
You have 160 comments!
Oh!
It's Eun Jo!
Eun Jo is lacking in manners, isn't he?
He likes his older brother so much that he takes after him.
Still, he's cute.
He looks a lot like Seung Jo.
I think you probably looked pretty when you were a child as well.
Don't you have an album?
Aw, come on, let's see.
I don't have a lot of pictures.
Aww, how pretty!
Aww!
Your mom?
Oh, she's gorgeous.
That's why you're pretty.
To tell you the truth, I don't really remember her.
They say she passed away when I was four years old.
That's why I look at this sometimes, so I don't forget her.
There's a comment on every picture.
Hey, this is interesting.
"Summer.
Maybe because we didn't have an air conditioner, it was even cooler."
Hey, you are so witty. Did you write this?
- Yes.
- Aww!
"Bbomi is really light."
"Even something light becomes heavy after holding it for a while."
"Everything in life seems to be the same way."
Aww, you're cute.
Seung Jo was also cute, right? When he was little? Yeah, well...
Ah!
Ha Ni!
Would you like me to show you something fun?
Aww! She's so cute, she's so pretty!
Who is this?
She looks a lot like Seung Jo.
Really?
Yes.
Like this here... it's exactly the same.
It's Seung Jo.
What!?
This is Seung Jo.
Wait a minute.
Where was it?
Hold on.
Look here.
When I was pregnant with Seung Jo, he was very calm inside my belly.
He only wanted to eat watermelon, strawberries, and grapes.
So I really thought it was a girl.
That's why the shoes, clothes, and toys that I bought were all for a girl.
But it was a boy.
So what to do?
Do I throw it all away?
That's true, but...
And didn't I tell you... ...that I really wanted a girl?
That's why I raised him as a girl for just a little while.
But...
We went to the swimming pool and he was exposed.
He must have have been scarred at that time.
That's why I wonder if he's become so cold as a result of that.
Seung Jo thinks I burnt all of this.
But what can I do, when I have the photo negatives right here?
When you look at it this way, he's not even a genius.
Hey!
What is this?
Why do you keep laughing? (ooseo = laugh)
Me?!
I'm scary? (mooseo)
Yeah!
Scary.
Really?
I wonder why?
It's not a reaction from constipation?
Oh!
Baek Seung Jo?
- What's he doing here?
Who are you looking for?
Oh Ha Ni, get your P.E. uniform and come with me.
P.E. uniform?!
Why?
Okay.
Hey!
What's going on?
Why was Baek Seung Jo looking for you?
P.E. uniform?
It looks like they're exchanging something.
Isn't it the P.E. uniform?
Ahhh, this is really annoying!
Why?
You could have just worn it.
What?!
So what if you wear girls' clothing?
You're already familiar with it.
Hey!
Where did you find this?!
Give it to me!
What are they doing?
What is this?!
Oh Ha Ni.
What going on?!
What are they doing?!
What's going on? Ha?
Oh!
Seriously, that jerk!
Aah!
Let go!
Ha Ni!
Hey!
Aren't you gonna give it to me?!
Hey!
Hey!
Wait a second, I'll give it to you.
I have a condition.
Condition?
What condition?
Help me with my studies.
What?
Help me raise my grades on the next exam.
You're saying this knowing there's only one week until the exam?
Of course I know.
Please help me.
Please help me get into the study hall.
Do you see me as someone who can create miracles?
I'm not a god!
I understand.
Guys!
Hey!
Oh Ha Ni!
You're trickier than I thought you were.
I said that if you get into the study hall, I'd carry you on my back.
Now you want me to help you study, and give you a piggyback ride too?
If you help me, that becomes void.
Do you think I'm that petty?
Don't worry!
I don't have any feelings for you anymore.
Not even this little.
Really?
Hey!
Heeeeey! &lt;i&gt;Brought to you by the PKer team @ www.viki.com
Ahh.
This is so good.
Thanks to you, we ate so well.
I just brought over what was left at the restaurant.
But this! This!
It's really delicious!
Kkotjeon?
(griddle cake of gluttinous rice shaped like a flower)
Hapkkotjeon.
The scent of the clam is very nice.
Ahh, yes.
Thank you.
Ha Ni, what would you like for your late night snack?
Eh?
Ha Ni.
Are you going to study?
Starting today, please prepare for two.
Oh, why?
No way!
Are you going to study too?
It can't be anything too greasy or too sweet.
It'll be bad for her memory.
Wheat bread and olive oil should be enough.
And egg yolk too.
Oh.
Okay.
I'll get up first.
Hyung!
Teach m¬≠¬≠---
You do it with me.
I'll get going.
Hey!
Oh Ha Ni!
You don't even know this?
Why don't you just give up school?
What are you doing?
Baby Baek Seung Jo!
Oh Ha Ni!
Fine!
Then I'll start by explaining the basics completely, so listen well.
First, use "x" as the number you want to determine.
What is "x" here?
Huh?
What is "x" here?
Alphabet!
I don't know.
What is it?
That's right!
It's the number that we don't know.
"X" is the unknown number.
What do we call an unsolved case?
X-file?
That's right.
What did we call the younger generation when we were kids?
Generation X!
Yup.
The difficult to understand generation.
The unsolved case.
It was decided that "x" is used for unknown numbers.
But, why is it "x"... ...when there's "w" and "h"?
What's the use of discussing the "what ifs"?
It's already been decided.
Here,
X equals 2 to the 30th power times 10 to the negative 7th power.
log(x) = log (2^30 * 10^-7)
log(x) = 30log2 - 7log10 log(x)=30*0.3-7
log(x) = 2.
So, x = 100.
But since we're supposed to write this as a binary number, what is it?
What is 100 as a binary number?
Calculate it.
What does that mean?
I feel like I'm going to explode.
Yah!
Omo!
That Oh Ha Ni, so stupid and dumb.
Do you know what the decimal system is?
Yeah.
10&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;20&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;30
Then how about the binary numeral system?
It's a way to express a number using only 0 and 1.
But why?
What's the use of that?
The computer.
Computer?
In 1974, from the Arecibo Observatory, a message was sent to outer space.
If there were real aliens out there, they would receive the message and respond.
But in what language could the message be sent?
In English?
In Korean?
We don't know what the level of intelligence of the aliens could be, so in order for them to decipher the message by simply knowing 0 and 1, the message was sent in binary code.
Oh.
Ohhh!
In order to communicate with aliens, I should learn the binary system. This is a must learn. Put a star next to this.
Then, what is the way to change 100 to the binary numeral system?
Then, did we receive a response from the aliens?
So far, not yet.
But then again, the universe is so huge.
Right?
That's right!
Because the universe is so big, the log system was developed.
Really?
Log was made to express really big things.
Why don't you just give up?
Why?
It's fun.
How can there be so many things you don't know?
Do you know everything?
Who are these people?
Si Won, Kang In, Shin Dong, Kyuhyun, Han Kyung, Ki Bum...
Sung Min, Hee Chul, Ye Sung, Eun Hyuk, Dong Hae, Lee Teuk, Ryeowook (all 13 Super Junior members)!
We just have different fields of interest.
So, what about logarithms?
As shown in my electroencephalogram, even when I'm sleeping, my alpha waves are moving.
I can read 7000 words per minute; I also have an excellent memory.
When you breathe, put strength on your belly button and inhale slowly... ...and slowly exhale. &lt;Br&gt;Your eyes should be focused on the dot.
Not the wall!
The dot!
Focus!
Until you can only see the dot.
Move.
You must move your body as you memorize, in order to retain better.
"At" for objects.
"With" for people.
1592 Imjin invasion.
Ha Ni!
1592 Imjin invasion!
Oh!
What's wrong?!
Dark circles?
Ha Ni, tell us the truth.
What?
How are you doing at that place you're staying at?
I'm doing well.
Do you call this doing well?
Something's not right.
You heard it too, right?
Last time when I said I'd walk her home, she ran away.
Ha Ni,
Ha Ni, today let's...
Where did she go?
She went home.
She said she needs to study.
See, see, see!
What kind of studying would she do?
In my opinion...
Surely...
Surely?
They're working her to death without letting her sleep.
You saw her face, right?
I think I, Bong Joon Gu, need to intervene.
Hyung.
How do I solve this?
Oh, Eun Jo.
Hyung needs to do this.
Ask Mom.
Yah!&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt; Oh Ha Ni!
You stupid, idiotic moron.
Because of you, I can't study and my brother can't sleep. Who the heck are you?
Go home!
Oh!
You came?
Oh. Just forget it.
Here.
What is this?
Read that for today and go to bed early.
Tomorrow's the exam.
What is this?
I came up with potential exam questions.
Wow!
When did you make all this?
I'm totally touched!
Yah!
I told you to hurry and look through it.
Stop talking nonsense!
I got it.
Why get mad?
It'd be nice if all the questions came out of this.
He's sleeping.
Then again, he hasn't slept much because of me.
The Almighty Baek Seung Jo sleeps like this.
Thank you.
Kids!
Oh my gosh!
Jackpot!
Let me get the camera!
I'm dying.
Oh my.
It's tiring.
Oh gosh.
Good luck.
Punk!
What's with the cool act?
Is this good?
Wait...
A little higher.
- Baek Seung Jo got a perfect score again. &lt;i&gt; Wow, he got a perfect score again. &lt;i&gt;When he couldn't even sleep much lately because of me. &lt;i&gt;What a relief!
You got a perfect score again!
You're amazing!
Congrats!
Of course, I studied for the first time in my life.
How could I &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; get a perfect score?
You too.
Huh?
You didn't see it yet?
Me?
Me? [50th - Oh Ha Ni]
Oh Ha Ni.
You saw?
I did it!
Thank you!
Thank you so, so much!
It's all thanks to you!
Most of the exam questions were what you predicted!
What are you doing?
That thing.
Ahh.
This?
Don't just take it out any place!
Seung Jo!
Thank you!
Really! Thank you so much!
Stop!
Yes.
Me?
Yes, you.&lt;BR&gt;Baek Seung Jo.
How can you leave just like that when there are so many witnesses?
Huh?
You promised to give her a piggyback ride around the school if our Ha Ni got into the Special Study Hall.
No, teacher.
We decided to void that.
What are you talking about?
This kind of miracle may never happen again!
But...that....
No, we can't!
When you said you were going to study hard, I just dismissed it.
As a teacher, I couldn't even help you.
I'm so proud of you, Ha Ni!
You saved my pride!
But...
What the heck are you... Did you lie?
No, teacher. No.
Carry her!
Carry her!
Carry her! &lt;i&gt;Brought to you by the PKer team @ www.viikii.net&lt;/i&gt;
What do you mean it's okay?
Get on!
What are you doing?
It's you again?
Yeah, why?
Hey, come here.
But...
Cheers!
Baek Seung Jo...
I don't like him.
"Honestly, I call you the Spirit of the Forest."
Yah!
It's amazing.
It's a lot more serious than I thought.
Yah!
One, two.
Good job!
What's that?
It looks like socks.
No!
Mom is always the troublemaker in our house.
Done.
Something fell.
What is it?
What is it?
You'll see the water shoals on the island side... while the deep soundings run to the mainland.
Have any of you seen the captain today? - No.
He wasn't down for dinner. - No, and he wasn't down for lunch.
He hasn't left the bridge since you decided to come through the channel.
What are you driving at? Ever since you gave him those orders yesterday to cut through these waters... he's had the jitters.
There's something wrong. I... Hey, I'm getting nervous myself.
Doc, what do you recommend for nerves? - Give him a shot of scotch.
- Give the whole bottle. - No!
I've got nerves too.
- Here you are, Doc. Just what you need.
- Well, maybe you're right.
- And how, boy. - Good evening, Captain.
- Good evening, sir.
- May I speak with you?
- Why, certainly. Go ahead.
We're heading straight for the channel between Branca Island and the mainland.
- Good.
- But the lights are just a bit off, according to the chart.
The charts are never up to date in this part of the Pacific.
You know that. I know, sir, but...
Doesn't Branca Island mean anything to you?
- Well, not a lot. - Perhaps if I spoke with Mr. Rainsford...
Bob's not a sailor.
He's a hunter. He's made many of these trips. He's young, but he has judgment.
I'll call him.
- Oh, Bob. Bob!
- What is it?
- Come up here, will ya? - Just a minute. What's bothering you, Captain?
There are no more coral-reefed, shark-infested waters in the whole world than these.
Boy! Just take a look at these.
You didn't turn out so hot as a hunter, Doc, but oh, what a photographer.
If we'd had you to take pictures on the Sumatran trip... they might have believed my book.
If you'd had me on the Sumatran trip, you'd have never had me on this one.
Say, here's a swell one of the ship, Skipper.
What's the matter?
These old sea dogs tell yarns to kid each other... and end up believing it all themselves.
I think that Mr. Rainsford should know... that the channel lights aren't just in the position given on the charts.
Oh. Well, what do you think, fellas?
I think we should turn back and take the outside course.
We'll go ahead. Very well, sir.
It's your ship.
"It was the schooner 'Hesperus,' and she sailed the wintry sea. "
Let's talk this over. - There's no use taking any chances. - Chances?
That's fine talk... coming from a fella who just got through slapping tigers in the face.
Get an eyeful of this.
And he talks about taking chances. Here's the doc charging the enemy with an unloaded camera.
Get the expression on Doc's face, Bill.
He looks more frightened than the tiger. - He is.
- What'd you have on your mind, Doc? I'll tell you what I had on my mind.
I was thinking of the inconsistency of civilization.
The beast of the jungle killing just for his existence is called savage.
The man, killing just for sport, is called civilized.
- Hear! Hear! - It's a bit contradictory, isn't it?
Now, just a minute.
What makes you think... it isn't just as much sport for the animal as it is for the man?
Take that fellow right there, for instance.
There never was a time when he couldn't have gotten away.
He didn't want to.
He got interested in hunting me.
He didn't hate me for stalking him... any more than I hated him for trying to charge me.
As a matter of fact, we admired each other.
Perhaps, but would you change places with the tiger?
- Well, not now. - Mm-mm!
Here comes that bad-luck lady again.
Third time tonight.
- Here. Let me shuffle them. - Wait a minute.
Don't evade the issue. - Yeah, speak up. - I asked you a question.
- You did? I forgot.
- Oh, no, you didn't.
I asked you if there'd be as much sport in the game... if you were the tiger instead of the hunter.
- Come on. - What's your answer now, Bob?
That's something I'll never have to decide.
Listen here, you fellows. This world's divided into two kinds of people... the hunter and the hunted.
Luckily, I'm a hunter. Nothing can ever change that.
Hang on!
Hello!
Hello, down there!
Hello, Engine Room!
- The panel is flooded!
- If the water hits those hot boilers...
Help!
Help!
You trying to drown me? Where are the others? See anybody?
Nobody left but us two and... that fella.
Doc! Help! - Look!
Ohh!
It got me!
Don't you understand any English? Lvan does not speak any language.
He has the misfortune to be dumb. Oh, hello. Are you the owner here?
Welcome to my poor fortress. - Fortress? - It once was.
Built by the Portuguese, centuries ago.
I have had the ruins restored to make my home here. I am Count Zaroff.
My name's Robert Rainsford. Glad to meet you.
Very glad.
Lvan is a Cossack. I am afraid, like all my fellow countrymen, he is a bit of a savage.
Smile, Ivan.
I was trying to make him understand there'd been a shipwreck in the channel.
But how appalling!
And you mean to say that you are the only survivor?
Yes, I'm afraid I am.
You're certain? I'd have never left the spot if I hadn't been.
The swellest crowd on Earth... my best friends.
- It's incredible. - Such things are always incredible.
Death is for others, not for ourselves.
That is how most of my other guests have felt. Your other guests?
You mean this has happened before? My fellow, we have several survivors from the last wreck still in the house. It would seem that this island were cursed.
Only he thought it was uninhabited. We Cossacks find our inspiration in solitude.
- Well, it's a break for me, anyway.
- My house is yours. Oh, by the way.
You'll want to change those wet rags immediately. Yes. They look about the way I feel.
Yes.
I have some loose hunting clothes which I keep for my guests... that you can possibly get into.
Lvan will show you to your room.
- Thank you.
- You'll find a stiff drink there also.
Thanks a lot.
All pleasure is mine.
Come in.
- Ready, Rainsford? - All set.
I'm afraid we have finished dinner.
But I have ordered something for you.
Thanks. I don't feel like eating, though. Oh.
Well, perhaps later.
Now, then, what do you say to coffee... and most charming company? It is hard to forget your comrades' fate, I know... but our feminine guest is easily perturbed. If I could beg you to put a good face upon the matter.
- Thank you. Miss Trowbridge, may I present Mr. Robert Rainsford. - Miss Eve Trowbridge.
- How do you do? - And her brother, Mr. Martin Trowbridge. How are you, old chap?
Pretty well shaken up, I guess, huh?
- Coming out of it now, thanks. - We know how it feels, don't we, Eve?
Indeed we do.
Perhaps Mr. Rainsford would like some hot coffee.
Oh, yes, of course.
Mr. Rainsford, please sit here. Vodka, that's the stuff! One shot'll dry you out quicker than all the coffee in Java.
Like this. Now, Martin, you don't have to drink it all tonight, do you? Don't be ridiculous, sis.
Same as Mr. Rainsford. And if anyone has a right to his liquor, it's a victim of circumstance.
- Isn't that so, Count? - Of course, yes.
- You were in a shipwreck too? - Yes. Our lifeboat was the only one saved... my brother and I and two sailors.
The count found us on the beach with nothing but the clothes on our backs.
Those channel lights must have been shifted. - I wonder it hasn't been reported.
- Well, we'll report 'em... just as soon as we get back to the mainland.
You see, the count has only one launch... and that's under repair.
Russians are not the best mechanics.
I'm afraid we'll have to be patient a few days longer.
It's all right with me. I feel as if I were living on borrowed time right now.
Speaking of that, perhaps now you'll tell us... a little bit about who you are.
Just sketchily, you know... born, married, why I left my last job.
No, no, no, no. One moment, please.
Mr. Rainsford need never explain who he is in my house.
We entertain a celebrity, Miss Trowbridge.
Wait a minute, wait a minute.
Don't tell me.
Let me guess. I know.
Flagpole sitter.
- I know. He wrote some books. - No, he lived some books.
If I am not mistaken, this is Mr. Robert Rainsford... who hunts big game so adventurously.
Yeah? Here's to ya.
- I've lugged a gun around a little.
- "I've lugged a gun around a little. "
No, I have read your books. I read all books on hunting. - A papiroso?
Only in yours have I found a sane point of view. - What do you mean, "sane"? - Cigarette?
- Hmm? Yeah. Thanks.
- You do not excuse what needs no excuse. Let me see.
How did you put it?
"Hunting is as much a game as stud poker... only the limits are higher. " - You have put our case perfectly.
- Then you're a hunter yourself?
We are kindred spirits.
It is my one passion.
He sleeps all day and hunts all night.
And what's more, Rainsford, he'll have you doing the same thing.
We'll have capital sport together, I hope.
Don't encourage him.
He's had our two sailors so busy... chasing around the woods after flora and fauna... that we haven't seen them for three days.
But what do you hunt here?
I'll tell you.
You will be amused, I know.
I have done a rare thing.
I have invented a new sensation.
Yeah, and is he stingy with it.
What is this sensation, Count?
Mr. Rainsford, God made some men poets.
Some He made kings, some beggars.
Me, He made a hunter.
My hand was made for the trigger, my father told me.
He was a very rich man... with a quarter of a million acres in the Crimea, and an ardent sportsman.
When I was only still up high he gave me my first gun.
- Good for him. - My life has been one glorious hunt.
It would be impossible for me to tell you how many animals I have killed.
- But when the revolution... - Look out.
Oh, I'm so sorry. Count Zaroff was so interesting...
I didn't realize the danger. Oh, it's all right now.
What were you saying about the revolution, Count?
Oh, merely that I escaped with most of my fortune.
Naturally, I continued to hunt all over the world.
It was in Africa that the Cape buffalo gave me this.
That must have been a close call. Yes.
It still bothers me sometimes.
However, in two months I was on my way to the Amazon.
I'd heard that the jaguars there were unusually cunning. No, no, no. No sport at all.
Well, conditions are bad everywhere these days.
One night, as I lay in my tent with this... this head of mine... a terrible thought crept like a snake into my brain.
Hunting was beginning to bore me.
Is that such a terrible thought, Count? It is, my dear lady, when hunting has been the whip for all other passions.
When I lost my love of hunting...
I lost my love of life... of love.
Well, you seem to have stood it pretty well.
I even tried to sink myself to the level of the savage.
I made myself perfect in the use of the Tartar war bow. Tartar which?
Tartar war bow...
That one up there.
It's cute.
Even to this day I prefer to hunt with it... but alas, even that was too deadly.
What I needed was not a new weapon... but a new animal.
- A new animal?
- Exactly so. You found one?
Yes. Here on my island...
I hunt the most dangerous game.
"The most dangerous game"? You mean tigers? Tigers?
No.
The tiger has nothing but his claws and his fangs.
I heard some queer beast howling back there along the water.
Was that it? It's no use, Rainsford.
He won't tell.
He won't even let you see his trophy room... till he gets ready to take you on a hunt of the great whatsit.
I keep it as a surprise for my guests... against the rainy day of boredom.
You let me in on that game... and I'll bet you I go for it. You know, Rainsford, he hasn't failed yet.
If he says a thing is good, it is good.
He's a judge of liquor, wizard at contract... plays the piano... anything you want.
He's a good host and a good scholar, eh, Count?
Yes, yes. You want me to go hunting?
You just say the word. We're pals. We'll have a big party, get cockeyed and go hunting.
A completely civilized point of view.
I tell you what you do.
You come to my place in the Adirondacks, see.
We'll have a private car, liquor and gals on the trip... and the guides will make the deers behave.
I think we'd better change the subject. All right. Change the subject.
If you wish. Good idea. Play the piano.
Leave it to me, and I'll fix everything.
Perhaps the count doesn't want to play.
There you go, sis, throwing cold water. Leave me alone. I know where the piano is.
I'm perfectly sober.
Charming simplicity.
"Completely civilized," did you say?
He talks of wine and women as a prelude to the hunt.
We barbarians know that it is after the chase... and then only that man revels.
It does seem a bit like cocktails before breakfast.
Of course, yes. You know the saying of the Ugandi chieftains... "Hunt first the enemy, then the woman. "
That's the savages' idea everywhere. It is the natural instinct.
What is woman... even such a woman as this... until the blood is quickened by the kill?
- Oh, I don't know.
- "Oh, I don't know. " You Americans.
One passion builds upon another.
Kill! Then love. When you have known that... you will have known ecstasy.
Oh, Martin!
Here you see Zaroff, the keyboard king... in his Branca Island hour.
Come on, Count. Now, you show them.
- What do you suggest? - Oh, just a good tune. But not highbrow, like last night.
- Just a good tune, see?
- I see.
Oh, his hunting dogs.
Keep your voice low and listen.
It isn't true about the launch needing repairs.
I heard it leave the boathouse last night. It returned this morning. You mean he's keeping you from returning to the mainland?
Yes.
Well, perhaps he enjoys the company of two very charming people.
There were four of us a week ago.
- The other two have disappeared.
- What do you mean?
One night after dinner, the count took one of our sailors... down to see his trophy room... at the foot of those stone steps.
- That iron door? - Yes.
Two nights later he took the other there. Neither has been seen since. Have you asked him about them?
He says they've gone hunting.
Oh, be careful. He's watching us.
Will you smile, as if I'd said something funny?
Now look here. You must be mistaken. Not now.
I'm afraid we have failed to hold the full attention of our audience. Well, I expect it's rather difficult for Mr. Rainsford... to concentrate on anything after all he's been through.
My dear lady, you are pleading for yourself.
I can see the drooping of those lovely eyes.
Excuse me.
You know, the count's worse than a family governess.
Every night he sends us off to bed like naughty children.
Oh, no, my dear. No.
Charming children.
There, you hear that, sis?
Now trot along upstairs and don't bother us grownups anymore.
Well, after that I guess... I guess I'll have to go. - Good night, Mr. Rainsford.
We'll be seeing each other at breakfast. - Good night.
- Good night.
Good night, sis.
We won't be seeing each other at breakfast.
Oh, my dear Rainsford, I have been most inconsiderate.
You must be feeling the need of sleep too.
- Yes, I am just about all in.
- Then Ivan will show you to your room.
Oh, Martin, turn in early, please?
Don't worry.
The count'll take care of me, all right.
Indeed I shall.
- Well, good night. - Good night, sir.
Sleep well.
Oh, uh, well, here's to long life.
A long life.
Tell me, Mr. Trowbridge... are you also fatigued?
Tired? Me?
You know I'm not.
You know, Rainsford, we two are just alike.
Up all night and sleep all day.
Well, good night.
Well, what are we gonna do, huh?
What's the big idea?
I thought that perhaps... tonight you would like to see my trophy room? Your trophy room?
I'm sure you will find it most... interesting.
Say, that's a great idea. Ho-ho. Now we're pals.
No more secrets now, huh? - We'll make a night of it. - I hope so, Mr. Trowbridge.
Attaboy, County, old boy, old boy, County.
Please let me come in.
I'm sorry to disturb you, but I'm frightened.
- What was it? Those dogs? - My brother.
I've just gone to his room. He isn't there!
- He's probably somewhere with the count. - That's just what I'm afraid of. Count Zaroff is planning something... about my brother and me.
You don't really think anything has happened to your brother?
Oh, I don't know, but we've got to find him. Won't you help me? Why, of course I'll help you.
- Where do you think he's gone?
- Where did the others go?
The iron door.
I'll meet you downstairs in five minutes.
Thank you.
That's queer.
It's unlocked.
Zaroff! He's coming down.
Back here, quick!
Where is my brother? You killed him! You killed my brother!
Why, you... Come, come, my dear Rainsford. I don't want to treat you like my other guests.
You and I, we are hunters.
So that's your most dangerous game.
Yes. My dear fellow, I intended to tell you last night... but you know, Miss Trowbridge... You hunted him like an animal.
An hour with my trophies... and they usually do their best to keep away from me. Where do you get these poor devils? Providence provided my island with dangerous reefs.
- You shifted them. - Precisely right.
Too bad your yacht should have suffered... but at least it brought us together.
You take half-drowned men from ships you've wrecked... and drive them out to be hunted.
I give them every consideration... good food, exercise... everything to get them in splendid shape. - To be shot down in cold blood. - Oh, no, no.
I even wait until midnight to give them the full advantage the dark.
And if one eludes me only till sunrise... he wins the game.
Suppose he refuses to be hunted.
Ivan is such an artist with these.
Invariably, Mr. Rainsford, invariably they choose to hunt.
And when they win?
To date I have not lost.
Oh, Rainsford, you'll find this game worth playing. When the next ship arrives, we'll have gorgeous sport together.
You murdering rat! I'm a hunter not an assassin. Come, Rainsford.
Say you will hunt with me. Hunt men?
Say you will hunt with me!
No? What do you think I am?
One, I fear, who dare not follow his own convictions... to their logical conclusion.
I'm afraid in this instance, Mr. Rainsford... you may have to follow them.
What do you mean? I shall not wait for the next ship.
Four o'clock.
The sun is just rising.
Come, Mr. Rainsford.
Let us not waste time.
Ivan.
Your fangs and claws, Mr. Rainsford.
Bob!
Bob! Lvan. Bob!
Bob, what are they going to do? - I'm going to be hunted.
- Oh, no. No, Miss Trowbridge. Outdoor chess.
His brain against mine.
His good craft against mine.
- And the prize? - The prize?
You may recall what I said last evening.
Only after the kill... does man know the true ecstasy of love.
If I do not...
What shall I say?..
Find you... between midnight and sunrise tomorrow, freedom for both of you. - I'm going with you. - No.
He'll kill you too. Not at all. One does not kill a female animal.
I'll take her with me then.
We'll set him a trail he'll remember.
It's only fair to advise you against Fog Hollow.
Outdoor chess, Mr. Rainsford.
We'll beat this thing. - The others didn't.
- We will.
Come on.
Let's get going.
It seems as though we've come miles.
Yeah, but three hours doesn't take you far in this jungle.
Come on. Let's keep going. Come on.
Just a little more of this, then easy downhill going.
We'll soon be safe.
No wonder he was so sure.
This island is no bigger than a deer park.
Oh, Bob! Come on, now. What are we going to do?
And leave you here with that savage?
Not a chance.
Now we've got to think of something to worry him. You'd never get near him. He'd shoot on sight.
Weapons aren't everything in the jungle. Say, did you notice that leaning tree down there?
- The one we just passed? - Yes. I want to show you something.
If that supporting branch were cut away... this fallen tree would make a perfect Malay deadfall. A Malay deadfall? What's that?
We'll cut some strong vines.
There. Almost ready.
This bracelet of yours makes a fine guide ring for my necktie.
He'll have been on his way almost an hour now. Look out! Don't touch that trip line.
- Jungle wood's as heavy as iron. - Will it really work? I've never known a living thing to get by one yet.
Look here. You touch that trip line... it'll pull that trigger free. Once that's loose, there's nothing to keep the log from coming down.
We're ready.
Let him come.
Give me that knife.
Come out, Rainsford.
Why prolong it? I'll not bungle this shot.
You'll never even feel it.
But surely you don't think that anyone who has hunted leopards... would follow you into that ambush?
Oh, very well. If you choose to play the leopard...
I shall hunt you like a leopard.
Wait.
Maybe it's a trick.
Eve. Why did he go? He's playing with us... like a cat with a mouse.
- The swamp where he caught the others.
We haven't a chance of keeping ahead of him there.
- But there's no place else to run. - That's just what he's counting on. We've got two hours till dawn.
We've got to use our brains instead of our legs. But he'll have his rifle. And we'll have a man trap.
It makes me dizzy.
Cover this over. When Mr. Zaroff falls down there, he'll be all through hunting. Quick.
Gather some leaves and grass.
I'll cut some branches.
Yes.
Very good, Rainsford.
Very good. You have not won yet.
Look at your watch. Are you looking at it? Still half an hour till sunrise.
Swamp or no swamp, we can keep ahead of him that long.
As you are doubtless saying, the odds are against me.
You have made my rifle useless in the fog.
You cannot blame me if I overcome that obstacle.
Those animals I cornered... now I know how they felt.
Achmed, Miss Trowbridge... bring her here. Now! My dear Rainsford, I congratulate you.
No!
The boat!
Quick!
Impossible.

A lot of people, including myself, have found the study of World War I to be a little bit confusing sometimes.
And I think the reason is, the world was very different, leading up to World War I, than it is today. The modern world we live in was shaped, to a large degree, by World War I, and then later [by]

Lens problems are actually quite common throughout all camera brands.
Usually it's cause by sand or grit interfering with the lens extension mechanism.
Or the camera's been dropped with the lens extended.
Or the camera has been powered on, but the lens had been blocked preventing its extension.
Or the battery ran down with the lens extended. Fortunately, about half the cameras that suffer this failure can easily be fixed by one of the following methods.
None of these methods involve opening the camera, although some have potential to cause other damage to the camera if excessively done.
If the camera is still under warranty, before trying any of these, please please first contact your camera's maker to see if they'll cover the repair, or to determine how much they'll charge for the repair.
These repair methods are listed in the order of risk of damaging your camera.
Thus make sure you try them in the listed order.
And remember, these fixes (especially #6 and 7) should only be considered for a camera that's out of warranty, who's cost of repair would be excessive, and would otherwise be considered for disposal if unrepaired:
#1:
Remove the batteries from the camera, wait a few minutes.
Put a fresh set of batteries back in (preferably rechargeable NiMH 2500mah or better) and turn the camera on.
If using rechargeables, and they're more than a year old, consider purchasing new rechargeable batteries as they may not be providing sufficient power to startup the camera.
#1a:
If new batteries didn't work, try pressing and holding the Menu, Function, Function Set, or OK button while turning the camera on.
This along with Fix #1c and #2 sometimes work for lens errors that occur from batteries wearing down while the lens was extended.
For those of you who can still access your camera's menus with this error, try finding and selecting the "factory reset" option to set your camera back to its original factory condition.
On some Canon cameras, this requires holding the menu button down with the camera powered on for up to 10 seconds.
However note that a lens error might sometimes override the reset option, and thus the option might not appear.
#2:
If the camera's batteries ran down completely while its lens was still open, the camera may show a lens error or not start properly when new batteries are installed.
Remove the memory card and keep it removed, then install the new batteries.
When you turn the camera on with the card removed it may come back to life, as this triggers a reset in some cameras.
Error E30 (for older Canon's) means that you don't have a memory card installed, so turn it off, slip in the SD card and turn it on one last time
#3:
Insert the cameras Audio/Video (AV) cable, and turn the camera on.
Inserting this cable ensures that the camera's LCD screen remains off during the start process.
Thus extra battery power is available to the camera's lens motor during startup.
This extra power can be useful in overcoming grit or sand particals that may be jamming the lens.
If the AV cable doesn't fix the lens error by itself, consider keeping this cable installed while trying fixes 4, 5, and 7 as a means to provide extra power to help to these fixes.
But note that I DON'T recommend keeping the cable installed during Fix 6 as you may damage the AV port while tapping the camera.
Reinsert the cable only AFTER tapping the camera.
#4:
Place the camera flat on its back on a table, pointed at the ceiling.
Press and hold the shutter button down, and at the same time press the power-on button.
The idea is that the camera will try to autofocus while the lens is extending, hopefully seating the lens barrel guide pins back into their slots.
#5: Blow compressed air in the gaps around the lens barrels with the idea of blowing out any sand or grit that may be in there jamming the lens.
Other variations include blowing with a hair dryer in "no heat" setting, or sucking the gaps with a vacuum (careful with this one).
Some people also have actually used a "Shop Vac" with this fix to help extend a retracted lens.
#5a:
If you actually do notice sand particles stuck in the gaps around the lens barrel, and blowing air does not help to dislodge them, consider using a thin piece of paper or a sewing needle to help dislodge them.
Pay particular care not to scratch your lens barrel with the needle.
Also, I do not recommend probing too deeply around the lens barrel with the paper (don't go more than a 1 cm or 1/2 in) .
Particularly I do not recommend probing deeply around the most outer (largest) lens barrel gap, as you may dislodge the lens barrel dust gasket that's located just inside of that gap.
Now we're entering into the realm of potentially damaging your camera in conducting the fix.
There is definitely some risk in the following repair techniques, so carefully consider your options before considering conducting the following fixes.
The following fixes are NOT recommended for a valuable camera.
These following fixes should only be considered for a camera that's out of warranty, who's cost of professional repair would be excessive or more than the value of the camera, and only for a camera that would otherwise be considered for disposal if not repaired
#6: Repeatedly tap the padded/rubber usb cover on a hard surface with the intent of dislodging any particles that may be jamming the lens gears located inside the camera.
Other variations include hitting a side of the camera against the palm of your hand.
A lot of people have reported success with this method.
HOWEVER, there is also some obvious potential for damaging or dislodging internal components with this method, such as unseating ribbon cables, or cracking LCD screens.
#6a:
This is a variation of Fix #6, and should be tried if the lens barrels appears straight (not crooked).
In other words, try this if there's no obvious mechanical damage to the lens barrels that's causing the problem.
With the lens pointed down, try "gently" tapping around the lens barrels with a small item such as a pen or pencil.
The idea is to try to dislodge any sand particles that may be jamming the lens barrel stuck.
Simultaneously try turning the camera on and off as you're doing this.
The next repair steps discussed are very extreme and have high potential for damaging your camera.
However, they also have been shown to be the most effective in correcting a lens error.
Again, consider the following only for a camera that you will dispose of if you can not repair it yourself.
#7a:
Note that this particular fix is intended only for cameras with lens barrels that try to extend, but then stop partway, and then return to their stored position.
Try grabbing and holding the smallest inner lens barrel at its furthest extended position, preventing it from returning to the camera.
Examine and clean around the lens barrel any noticed dust or dirt.
Turn off and restart the camera again.
If the lens extends even further, grab it again at its furthest extension, preventing it from returning.
Clean again.
Keep repeating until the lens is fully extended.
Turn off the camera and restart it to see if the lens error has gone away.
#7b:
You especially might consider this if the lens barrel appears obviously damaged, bent, or crooked such as from a fall.
In that case, try thinking of the lens as a dislocated shoulder.
Try forcing the lens to straighten it and put it back in its place.
In such cases, the lens barrel guide pins have become unseated from their guide slots (see the below illustration).
Your objective would be to try to reseat them by straightening the lens.
Listen for a "click" to hint that they've been reseated, and immediately stop forcing the lens at this point.
More people have reported success with this method than with any of the other methods (see the polls in the right column).
Variations to #7b include gently pulling, rotating, and/or twisting the lens barrel while hitting the power button.
Examine the lens barrels closely for any hint of tilt or unevenness.
Again, the goal is to attempt to straighten or align the barrel if it's crooked or twisted.
Another variation includes looking for uneven gaps around the lens barrel, and then pushing on the side of the lens barrel that has the largest gap (note pushing the lens barrel all the way in is NOT recommended as it may become stuck there).
Again, while doing any of the above, listen for a click that indicates that the lens barrel guide pins may have reseated in their guide slots.
If you hear this click, immediately stop and try the camera.
The following photo illustrates unseated guide pins that would cause a lens error.
Repeated tries of the above may be necessary.
Consider repeating these steps, especially if you notice some progress in the operation of the camera.
The camera was finally repaired after three tries of fix #7b.
If you try these fixes, please post a comment on how the fixes worked for you. Your experience may help others.
Note that most of the fixes listed here actually came from reader's comments on my blog site.
If the above fixes didn't work for you, then please consider visiting my blog and read through the reader's comments, especially the newer ones. Please also comment if none of the fixes were successful, or if you tried something different that worked. camerarepair.blogspot.com
When posting a comment, please specify your camera model, and the particular fix that worked.
You Came for This.
Maybe You Forgot?
You came for This.
You asked for This.
Maybe you forgot?
[Questioner:]
I don't know where I am.
[Mooji:]
Hmm.
[Q:]
It's like there was a...
[M:]
Hmm.
[Q:]
It's like the seeing that the one that's been witnessing is keeping the one that's playing this whole game alive.
It just seems like a... a game.
I sit here and I feel like I'm watching a movie.
[M:]
Hmm.
[Q:]
I don't know where I am.
Believe it or not, this is a very good state, but if you don't give it to your mind!
Mind says, 'You know, you need to know where you are,' in this kind of way.
It's in a certain phase, that's happened like this; you have lost...
Before, we have the sense that we have a particular position, we have a context for your existence, and you have a reference point; so you can refer constantly to your reference point.
But that was a very physical thing.
It was very much based upon the concept you have of who you are and your physical identity; psychological power and presence.
But as you come more and more into subtler regions of consciousness, these... boundaries - they are eroding somehow, naturally.
The ego needs memory very strongly.
It needs memory, the support of memory.
It needs to keep having proof and evidence of what it is.
Tremendous energy goes to support this egoic idea.
No energy goes to support consciousness.
It does not need memory; it doesn't have to have a fixed identity.
It's very broad: infinite expanse.
So you are moving somehow, the mind is converting from some kind of substance into that consciousness; it's beautiful, actually.
But something from the mind goes,
'You don't know where you are.'
And then some fear comes.
But this is also just an idea.
It's...
Don't make any conclusions now.
There is this changing over of power, like I'm speaking, and somehow, right, for the moment you feel like, 'I don't know what is what anymore.'
This is good.
It means openness is coming into the mind.
The tight concepts that we have been holding, preserving for so long - they are loosening up.
You may still have the use of concepts, but you don't make them so tight any more - no need, because your fearlessness is going.
Only when we are afraid do you need security; you need things in place, you need to know...
This is fear.
But now something is coming into a bigger space, a bigger field.
But you are still conscious.
You say you are looking at all of this life; sitting here listening, and all is feeling like a dream.
I am very happy.
Not a 'dro-o-o-o...' Not a dream.
But, somehow, that it doesn't have the bite anymore; not so real maybe.
What is it... ?
[Q:]
No, for me, just... just now in this last satsang,
[M:]
Yes.
[Q:] It's like I saw I was... up until then
I was in the position of the witnessing.
But seeing that the one that's been witnessing has been keeping the one that's in this game alive.
So...
[M:]
Ahhhhhh.
[Q:] this witness, which I related to,
[M:]
Yes.
[Q:] which was my reference point...
[M:]
Yes.
[M:]
Now it, itself, is being witnessed maybe?
It, itself, is being witnessed?
If the witness, which was your anchor, your reference point - because everything else is in front;
Now come back:
'I am the witness of this.'
Now the witness itself is not stable and then there's awareness of this also.
[Q:]
Yes.
[M:]
Yes, yes, yes.
So a deeper awareness is behind: that even this phenomenal witness now; because perhaps that witness still had some vested interest in how the show is going.
Then now this witness is...
A subtler consciousness is present.
Now, that witness now is becoming also seen.
And then fear comes, because you say, 'What support do I have now?'
If you take the support of the witness, which was my reference point, my anchor, then what do you leave me with?'
Then something is like, it's floating; but that is also just a sensation.
Don't panic.
Don't panic.
Don't stop.
Don't grab.
All these are the desperate moves of the old regime - old mind is still...
Still, witnessing of all of this is occurring also; not forced; it's occurring.
It's being revealed like that.
Can you bear this?
Hmm?
Don't put in your...
No requests.
Don't put any requests in:
'Oh, can you slow it down a bit?' or:
'Can we have a bit more of this?' or something.
No, don't ask for any compromise or any request.
Stay as you are; all of this is still just appearing in front of you.
Why should you cry, you see?
What are you losing of value?
Hmm?
Continue melting.
What did we say?
That... mind in the satsang is like a piece of ice in a glass of warm water and a melting is taking place.
This is this melting.
Hmm?
Ice is water.
Water is water.
But in the form of ice it appears like two; now it is only one.
What has been lost?
Hmm?
Name and form.
But essence, not.
If you listen to the mind, it will arise as so much fears; so much ghosts are going to come, so much gremlins are going to come, so much threats are going to come.
So don't listen; just ... stay as you are.
Don't hold onto anything; no need.
You came for this, you asked for this; maybe you forgot?
Very good.
Very good.
Very good, very good.
[Q:]
Thank you.
[M:]
Very good.
[Q:]
Thank you.
[M:]
Very good.
Very beautiful.
Very beautiful.
Video extract from Satsang DVD "The Lion Replaces the Sheep" 19th January 2012 Tiruvannamalai, India
My name is Ursus Wehrli, and I would like to talk to you this morning about my project, Tidying Up Art.
First of all -- any questions so far?
First of all, I have to say I'm not from around here.
I'm from a completely different cultural area, maybe you noticed?
I mean, I'm wearing a tie, first.
And then secondly, I'm a little bit nervous because I'm speaking in a foreign language, and I want to apologize in advance, for any mistakes I might make. Because I'm from Switzerland, and I just don't hope you think this is Swiss German
This is just what it sounds like if we Swiss try to speak American.
But don't worry -- I don't have trouble with English, as such.
I mean, it's not my problem, it's your language after all.
(Laughter)
After this presentation here at TED, I can simply go back to Switzerland, and you have to go on talking like this all the time.
(Laughter)
So I've been asked by the organizers to read from my book.
It's called "Tidying Up Art" and it's, as you can see, it's more or less a picture book.
So the reading would be over very quickly.
But since I'm here at TED, I decided to hold my talk here in a more modern way, in the spirit of TED here, and I managed to do some slides here for you.
I'd like to show them around so we can just, you know -- (Laughter)
Actually, I managed to prepare for you some enlarged pictures -- even better.
So Tidying Up Art, I mean, I have to say, that's a relatively new term.
You won't be familiar with it.
I mean, it's a hobby of mine that I've been indulging in for the last few years, and it all started out with this picture of the American artist, Donald Baechler I had hanging at home.
I had to look at it every day and after a while I just couldn't stand the mess anymore this guy was looking at all day long.
Yeah, I kind of felt sorry for him.
And it seemed to me even he felt really bad facing these unorganized red squares day after day.
So I decided to give him a little support, and brought some order into neatly stacking the blocks on top of each other.
(Laughter)
Yeah.
And I think he looks now less miserable.
And it was great.
With this experience, I started to look more closely at modern art.
Then I realized how, you know, the world of modern art is particularly topsy-turvy.
And I can show here a very good example.
It's actually a simple one, but it's a good one to start with.
It's a picture by Paul Klee.
And we can see here very clearly, it's a confusion of color.
(Laughter)
Yeah. The artist doesn't really seem to know where to put the different colors.
The various pictures here of the various elements of the picture -- the whole thing is unstructured.
We don't know, maybe Mr. Klee was probably in a hurry, I mean -- (Laughter)
-- maybe he had to catch a plane, or something.
We can see here he started out with orange, and then he already ran out of orange, and here we can see he decided to take a break for a square. And I would like to show you here my tidied up version of this picture.
(Laughter)
We can see now what was barely recognizable in the original:
17 red and orange squares are juxtaposed with just two green squares.
Yeah, that's great.
So I mean, that's just tidying up for beginners.
I would like to show you here a picture which is a bit more advanced.
(Laughter)
What can you say?
What a mess.
I mean, you see, everything seems to have been scattered aimlessly around the space.
If my room back home had looked like this, my mother would have grounded me for three days.
So I'd like to -- I wanted to reintroduce some structure into that picture.
And that's really advanced tidying up.
(Applause)
Sometimes people clap at this point, but that's actually more in Switzerland.
(Laughter)
We Swiss are famous for chocolate and cheese.
Our trains run on time.
We are only happy when things are in order.
But to go on, here is a very good example to see.
This is a picture by Joan Miro.
And yeah, we can see the artist has drawn a few lines and shapes and dropped them any old way onto a yellow background.
And yeah, it's the sort of thing you produce when you're doodling on the phone.
(Laughter)
And this is my -- (Laughter)
-- you can see now the whole thing takes up far less space.
It's more economical and also more efficient.
With this method Mr. Miro could have saved canvas for another picture.
But I can see in your faces that you're still a little bit skeptical.
So that you can just appreciate how serious I am about all this,
I brought along the patents, the specifications for some of these works, because I've had my working methods patented at the Eidgen√∂ssische Amt f√ºr Geistiges Eigentum in Bern, Switzerland.
(Laughter)
I'll just quote from the specification.
"Laut den Kunstpr√ºfer Dr. Albrecht --"
It's not finished yet.
"Laut den Kunstpr√ºfer Dr. Albrecht G√∂tz von Ohlenhusen wird die Verfahrensweise rechtlich gesch√ºtzt welche die Kunst durch spezifisch aufger√§umte Regelm√§ssigkeiten des allgemeinen Formenschatzes neue Wirkungen zu erzielen m√∂glich wird."
Ja, well I could have translated that, but you would have been none the wiser.
I'm not sure myself what it means but it sounds good anyway.
I just realized it's important how one introduces new ideas to people, that's why these patents are sometimes necessary.
I would like to do a short test with you.
Everyone is sitting in quite an orderly fashion here this morning.
So I would like to ask you all to raise your right hand.
Yeah.
The right hand is the one we write with, apart from the left-handers.
And now, I'll count to three.
I mean, it still looks very orderly to me.
Now, I'll count to three, and on the count of three
I'd like you all to shake hands with the person behind you.
OK?
One, two, three.
(Laughter)
You can see now, that's a good example: even behaving in an orderly, systematic way can sometimes lead to complete chaos.
So we can also see that very clearly in this next painting.
This is a painting by the artist, Niki de Saint Phalle.
And I mean, in the original it's completely unclear to see what this tangle of colors and shapes is supposed to depict.
But in the tidied up version, it's plain to see that it's a sunburnt woman playing volleyball.
(Laughter)
Yeah, it's a -- this one here, that's much better.
That's a picture by Keith Haring.
(Laughter)
I think it doesn't matter.
So, I mean, this picture has not even got a proper title.
It's called "Untitled" and I think that's appropriate.
So, in the tidied-up version we have a sort of Keith Haring spare parts shop.
(Laughter)
This is Keith Haring looked at statistically.
One can see here quite clearly, you can see we have 25 pale green elements, of which one is in the form of a circle.
Or here, for example, we have 27 pink squares with only one pink curve.
I mean, that's interesting.
One could extend this sort of statistical analysis to cover all Mr. Haring's various works, in order to establish in which period the artist favored pale green circles or pink squares.
And the artist himself could also benefit from this sort of listing procedure by using it to estimate how many pots of paint he's likely to need in the future.
(Laughter)
One can obviously also make combinations.
For example, with the Keith Haring circles and Kandinsky's dots.
You can add them to all the squares of Paul Klee.
In the end, one has a list with which one then can arrange.
Then you categorize it, then you file it, put that file in a filing cabinet, put it in your office and you can make a living doing it.
(Laughter)
So I'm -- (Laughter)
Actually, I mean, here we have some artists that are a bit more structured.
It's not too bad.
This is Jasper Johns.
We can see here he was practicing with his ruler.
(Laughter)
But I think it could still benefit from more discipline. And I think the whole thing adds up much better if you do it like this.
(Laughter)
And here, that's one of my favorites.
Tidying up Rene Magritte -- this is really fun.
You know, there is a -- (Laughter)
I'm always being asked what inspired me to embark on all this.
It goes back to a time when I was very often staying in hotels.
So once I had the opportunity to stay in a ritzy, five-star hotel.
And you know, there you had this little sign --
I put this little sign outside the door every morning that read,
"Please tidy room." I don't know if you have them over here.
So actually, my room there hasn't been tidied once daily, but three times a day.
So after a while I decided to have a little fun, and before leaving the room each day I'd scatter a few things around the space.
Like books, clothes, toothbrush, etc.
And it was great.
By the time I returned everything had always been neatly returned to its place.
But then one morning, I hang the same little sign onto that picture by Vincent van Gogh.
(Laughter)
And you have to say this room hadn't been tidied up since 1888.
And when I returned it looked like this.
(Laughter)
Yeah, at least it is now possible to do some vacuuming.
(Laughter)
OK, I mean, I can see there are always people that like reacting that one or another picture hasn't been properly tidied up.
So we can make a short test with you.
This is a picture by Rene Magritte, and I'd like you all to inwardly -- like in your head, that is -- to tidy that up.
So it's possible that some of you would make it like this.
(Laughter)
Yeah?
I would actually prefer to do it more this way.
Some people would make apple pie out of it.
But it's a very good example to see that the whole work was more of a handicraft endeavor that involved the very time-consuming job of cutting out the various elements and sticking them back in new arrangements.
And it's not done, as many people imagine, with the computer, otherwise it would look like this.
(Laughter)
So now I've been able to tidy up pictures that I've wanted to tidy up for a long time.
Here is a very good example.
Take Jackson Pollock, for example.
It's -- oh, no, it's -- that's a really hard one.
But after a while, I just decided here to go all the way and put the paint back into the cans.
(Applause)
Or you could go into three-dimensional art.
Here we have the fur cup by Meret Oppenheim.
Here I just brought it back to its original state.
(Laughter)
But yeah, and it's great, you can even go, you know --
Or we have this pointillist movement for those of you who are into art.
The pointillist movement is that kind of paintings where everything is broken down into dots and pixels.
And then I -- this sort of thing is ideal for tidying up.
(Laughter)
So I once applied myself to the work of the inventor of that method, Georges Seurat, and I collected together all his dots.
And now they're all in here.
(Laughter)
You can count them afterwards, if you like.
You see, that's the wonderful thing about the tidy up art idea: it's new.
So there is no existing tradition in it.
There is no textbooks, I mean, not yet, anyway.
I mean, it's "the future we will create."
(Laughter)
But to round things up I would like to show you just one more.
This is the village square by Pieter Bruegel.
That's how it looks like when you send everyone home.
(Laughter)
Yeah, maybe you're asking yourselves where old Bruegel's people went?
Of course, they're not gone.
They're all here.
(Laughter)
I just piled them up.
(Laughter)
So I'm -- yeah, actually I'm kind of finished at that moment.
And for those who want to see more, I've got my book downstairs in the bookshop.
And I'm happy to sign it for you with any name of any artist.
(Laughter)
But before leaving I would like to show you,
I'm working right now on another -- in a related field with my tidying up art method.
And I started to bring some order into some flags.
Here -- that's just my new proposal here for the Union Jack.
(Laughter)
And then maybe before I leave you ... yeah, I think, after you have seen that I have to leave anyway.
(Laughter)
Yeah, that was a hard one.
I couldn't find a way to tidy that up properly, so I just decided to make it a little bit more simpler.
(Laughter)
Thank you very much.
(Applause)
My name is Birke Baehr, and I'm 11 years old.
I came here today to talk about what's wrong with our food system.
First of all, I would like to say that I'm really amazed at how easily kids are led to believe all the marketing and advertising on TV, at public schools and pretty much everywhere else you look.
It seems to me like corporations are always trying to get kids, like me, to get their parents to buy stuff that really isn't good for us or the planet.
Little kids, especially, are attracted by colorful packaging and plastic toys.
I must admit, I used to be one of them.
I also used to think that all of our food came from these happy, little farms where pigs rolled in mud and cows grazed on grass all day.
What I discovered was this is not true.
I began to look into this stuff on the Internet, in books and in documentary films, in my travels with my family.
I discovered the dark side of the industrialized food system.
First, there's genetically engineered seeds and organisms.
That is when a seed is manipulated in a laboratory to do something not intended by nature -- like taking the DNA of a fish and putting it into the DNA of a tomato.
Yuck.
Don't get me wrong, I like fish and tomatoes, but this is just creepy.
(Laughter)
The seeds are then planted, then grown.
The food they produce have been proven to cause cancer and other problems in lab animals, and people have been eating food produced this way since the 1990s.
And most folks don't even know they exist.
Did you know rats that ate genetically engineered corn had developed signs of liver and kidney toxicity?
These include kidney inflammation and lesions and increased kidney weight.
Yet almost all the corn we eat has been altered genetically in some way.
And let me tell you, corn is in everything.
And don't even get me started on the Confined Animal Feeding Operations called CAFOS.
(Laughter)
Conventional farmers use chemical fertilizers made from fossil fuels that they mix with the dirt to make plants grow.
They do this because they've stripped the soil from all nutrients from growing the same crop over and over again.
Next, more harmful chemicals are sprayed on fruits and vegetables, like pesticides and herbicides, to kill weeds and bugs.
When it rains, these chemicals seep into the ground, or run off into our waterways, poisoning our water too.
Then they irradiate our food, trying to make it last longer, so it can travel thousands of miles from where it's grown to the supermarkets.
So I ask myself, how can I change?
This is what I found out.
I discovered that there's a movement for a better way.
Now a while back, I wanted to be an NFL football player.
I decided that I'd rather be an organic farmer instead.
(Applause)
Thank you.
And that way I can have a greater impact on the world.
This man, Joel Salatin, they call him a lunatic farmer because he grows against the system.
Since I'm home-schooled, I went to go hear him speak one day.
This man, this "lunatic farmer," doesn't use any pesticides, herbicides, or genetically modified seeds.
And so for that, he's called crazy by the system.
I want you to know that we can all make a difference by making different choices, by buying our food directly from local farmers, or our neighbors who we know in real life.
Some people say organic or local food is more expensive, but is it really?
With all these things I've been learning about the food system, it seems to me that we can either pay the farmer, or we can pay the hospital.
(Applause)
Now I know definitely which one I would choose.
I want you to know that there are farms out there -- like Bill Keener in Sequatchie Cove Farm in Tennessee -- whose cows do eat grass and whose pigs do roll in the mud, just like I thought.
Sometimes I go to Bill's farm and volunteer, so I can see up close and personal where the meat I eat comes from.
I want you to know that I believe kids will eat fresh vegetables and good food if they know more about it and where it really comes from.
I want you to know that there are farmers' markets in every community popping up.
I want you to know that me, my brother and sister actually like eating baked kale chips.
I try to share this everywhere I go.
Not too long ago, my uncle said that he offered my six-year-old cousin cereal.
He asked him if he wanted organic Toasted O's or the sugarcoated flakes -- you know, the one with the big striped cartoon character on the front.
My little cousin told his dad that he would rather have the organic Toasted O's cereal because Birke said he shouldn't eat sparkly cereal.
And that, my friends, is how we can make a difference one kid at a time.
So next time you're at the grocery store, think local, choose organic, know your farmer and know your food.
Thank you.
(Applause)
This is amazing, Wow.
I really don't know what to say, except that...
I totally deserve this.
Thank you.
Alright.
There you have it.
Can you believe I won?
I actually won!
I know.
And with absolutely no help whatsoever.
It's like a miracle.
This may be the happiest day of my life.
Hey, you know what. I should go Tweat all my followers.
No, no, no.
Wood called.
He wants us to meet him outside.
Oh, Reggie.
I can't.
There is a photographer here from A Bears Life Magazine.
He want's to shoot me right now.
They want to make me next months cover model.
Okay Nelson, your pagent reign is not the priority here.
Okay, if we are talking about priorities.
Then why are you sitting here and not keeping an eye on Ramone?
I am keeping an eye on Ramone.
I've been keeping an eye on Ramone all night.
He's right over there.
Oh my God, he's not there!
What the hell are you doing back here and not covering the front door?
I um..oh I had to take a leak.
So I was using the private restroom.
There's a big line out front and I'm a little pee shy.
How can you be shy about anything?
You use to flash your balls for a living.
I had a special clause in my contract.
No water sport.
So, we good Boss?
Why the hell do you have the combination to my safe written on the palm of your hand?!
Combination?
I don't know what you are talking about.
I mean. This is uh... This is uh... clearly...
Oh, this is my Mom's birthday.
And I wrote it on here so that I would remember to send her a card.
Oh, really.
Your Mom's birthday?
12 - 18 - 82?
That's her birthday.
That would make your Mom about 30 years old.
She had me very young
You're at least 40.
How could your mother be 10 years younger than you?
I don't know.
I always hated math.
Nobody tries to steel from me.
You're fired!
I want you out of here!
Go check the safe and make sure nothing is missing.
Go follow that guy.
I don't trust him.
And see what he's up to and report back.
This is explosive stuff.
Ramone is running some sort of money skimming operation.
So he can screw investors out of profits.
If J-Cub was doing accounting work like Cyril said.
He could have stumbled across the cooked books and threatened to blow the operation wide open.
Ya, but Ramone wasn't at our party.
So he couldn't have been the one who put the poison in the martini.
He could have hired someone.
Someone in desperate need of cash.
Someone who would have had a reason to be at our party.
Someone, oh I don't know, like the bartender?!
Okay,you know what, Reggie?
Don't even go there!
Todd had nothing to do with this.
And you know what, If you keep doing this our friendship's over!!
Okay, fine.
Fine.
So, what do we do now?
We got to go to the cops and show them this new evidence.
Maybe they can put some sort of pressure on Ramone to confess to killing J-Cub.
Detective Chad winters.
I'll do it. I'll call him.
Why you?
Oh, come on you guys.
He was totally coming on to me when he was at our house questioning us.
It was so obvious.
Not to me.
Me neither.
I thought he was coming on to me.
He was.
He was practically drooling over Wood.
Of course he was.
He was using Wood to get to me.
He just didn't want to appear overly aggressive.
What?!
Look, I'm going home.
I'm depressed.
I can't believe I lost a job before I even finished my first shift.
Well, I'm going inside because...
I'm Mr. Bear Chest 2012.
I have huge responsibility to attend to inside.
Okay, go, go.
I will call Detective Winters if I can get a signal.
Detective Winters please.
Tell him it's opportunity calling.
Well, in Syria, the president there has promised to consider reforms after a week of violent protest in the southern city of Daraa
But that hasn't stopped protesters, who have called for country-wide demonstrations on Friday
Thousands of the people were on the streets on Thursday to mourn people they say were shot during the government's crackdown.
There are reports that Bashar al-Assad will speak to the nation within the next few hours to try to calm the situtation.
Rula Amin joins me now from Damascus.
Rula, as we say, the president expected to address his population.
He has offered some quite substantial concessions, but they don't seem to be‚Äî or we don't know yet ‚Äîwhether they're going to have an impact on the day's protests.
Yes, it remains to be seen.
However, we did speak to many Syrians, including the people in Daraa. And, the response to these measures is mixed.
Now, the activists, and the hardcore opposition activists are very skeptical and they say these are just lip service, and won't change much.
Others do give the president the benefit of the doubt, and they say this is a good start. Let's give him some time.
Maybe it will materialize.
And, maybe there will be change in Syria without having, or forcing the people to go into the street.
We have to remember, the protests have been confined to Daraa despite seven days of very strong clashes, where dozens were killed.
The capital remained quiet, and so have the rest of the Syrian towns.
Now, today, it's going to be a challenge and a test, both for the activists and the opposition, and the government.
If the people take to the streets in other towns, maybe the concessions are too late.
If they don't, it means the president has managed to contain the crisis in Daraa, and that some of the people, some Syrians at least have bought his line, and are giving him time and putting some faith in these new measures.
But, the fact that the measures have been offered at all Rula, to put this into context for us, how surprising is that, given that this is a regime which has a history of heavy handed brutal crackdowns on any kind of uprising?
Yes, six months ago, nobody would have dreamt that these kinds of concessions would have been made in Syria, but by a month ago it seemed very logical.
Now, I arrived here on Sunday, and the minute I arrived, it was obvious that both the people the Syrian people and the government realize that change is coming to Syria, and the government knows it cannot continue with its old ways.
And, the president had made it clear he understands the need to reform and he will do it.
The people want it now, they want it serious they want it meaningful, and they don't want to wait.
And, there's a race with time.
Now, some people believe that the president himself wants to change, but he is surrounded by a group of people, or the system itself, that's not allowing him to do what he wants to do.
This is kind of giving him the benefit of the doubt.
The protest in Syria, in Daraa, added more pressure on the government, and made the government feel that it's very urgent to act now before it's too late.
So, for now, it seems the president is keen to contain the crisis in Syria and he's determined.
People want to make sure he's also determined to bring change to Syria, not just to contain the crisis.
And, of course, we will be following the developments there with you Rula.
Thanks very much indeed, for now Rulla, in Damascus.
we're used to seeing things from a particular point of view that is from a particular frame of reference and things look different to us under different circumstances at the moment
you look to queue here you're upside down you're the ones upside down no europe turns out well not he's the one that's upside down his name well let's talk for a
hi you lose people want to really up that that you better come into my frame of reference now
frame of reference was inverted from what it usually is that view of things would be normal for me if i normally walk to my friends this represents a frame of reference just three route that together so that peace is at right angles to the other two now i'm going to move in this direction if either plane at the same spot on your screen but you know i'm moving that way because you see the wall moving that way behind me but how do you know that i'm not that i think bill and the wall moving workable now the wallet that the pier and you have no way of telling whether imovie or not but now you know that i'm moving the point of it is that all motions it's relative in both cases i was moving relative to the wall and the wall with moving relative to me all motion is relative but we tend to think of one thing is being fixed and the other thing has been moving we usually think of the earth inspect and walls are usually pick to beer so perhaps you were the part of the first time when it was the wallet was moving and not doctor whom a frame of reference text of the earth is the most common frame of reference in which to observe the motion of other things that is the frame of reference that you're used to the framers baton to the table the table is bolted to the floor the florida anchored in the building and the building at firmly attached to the earth of course the reason for having three rods if the position uh... any object such as this fall can be specified using these three reference line this reference line points in the direction which we called up two different directions here than it is on the other side of the air and these two reference lines specify a plane which we call horizontal or level in this film we're going to look at the motion of object in this third frame of reference and other frames of reference moving in different ways relative to the other frame well let's look at a motion this field ball can be held are by the electra mode no i'm going to open the switch and you watch the motions of the ball the ball is accelerated straight down by gravity along the line parallel to this vertical reference blood as you can see the electromagnetic mounted on the cockpit can move i'm going to do exactly the same experiment the doc resume did but this time while a cart is moving at a constant velocity is pulled along by spring which is longer on this photograph turntable and that hold that with a constant velocity when the car passes this line be lol this week that you can see i'm going to start the cart down at the end of the table so that by the time it gets to this point by can be sure it's moving with a constant velocity i want you to watch right here so that you will see the ball falling
i think you can see that the ball landed in exactly the same position of the did before when doctor whom did the experiment with the car text but this time the ball could not have fallen straight down let me show you off the ball was released at that point if it had fallen straight down because the cart moves on in the time to take the fall would have landed back here somewhere but it didn't wanted to do the experiment again best time i'm going to let you watch the motion through slow-motion camera which is fixed the cart moves by the ball will fall and you can watch a missile which the camera
how true this again first-time there'll be a line on the film so if you can see the fat repeatedly complete but the problem all to the ground all of this has been in a frame of reference fixed to the year all of this motion locked in a frame of reference which was moving along with the car frame of reference like that well so that you can see what it looks like i'm going through solution camera so that it was with the car permittivity experiment again incidently i started and the number to stand here when the ball for all of you will have something which is fixed as a reference point
in their moving frame of reference i think you can see but the problem all as a political straight line it looks exactly the same as the day before when doctor whom did the experiment with the car etc if we were moving along in this frame of reference and we couldn't see the surroundings then we wouldn't be able to tell by this experiment that we were moving at a constant velocity as a matter of fact we wouldn't be able to tell by any experiment that we were moving at a constant velocity i'm gonna do the experiment once more and this time i'm not going to stand here behind the ball at the fall so that you won't have any fixed repertoire
as far as you're concerned that time the karke wasn't necessarily moving at all that time when you couldn't see the background then i think perhaps it was harder for you to realize that you were in moving frame of reference important thing to realize here all frames of reference moving at constant velocity with respect to one another are equivalent doctor ivy showed you but the motion of the ball that was released from the moving karte
looked like in the current frame of reference and in the car frame the motion looks simpler from a car now i want you to watch the motion white spot would probably be the clock moving out circle
but that is what it's practiced actually like in the hurt of reference this is your normal frame of reference you father thought moving in the circle because you're high moved along with the car you put yourself in the frame of reference of the moving truck so if it isn't always true that we view motion from the third frame of reference when the motion is simpler from the moving frame you automatically put yourself and not moving frame now we're going to do another experiment on a relative motion to show how the compare the block today of an object in one printer records to explore all serbian another frame of reference forgiveness drive a spark a certain stark it moves a straight across the table with a speed which is essentially constant because the forces of friction of the made very small this is just the law of inertia an object moves the constant velocity unless an unbalanced force acts on it how you get the same start backwards uh... dougherty and gives it the same started moves back in this direction with the same philosophy now we're on a car here a car which can move in which were you going to move in this direction and we're going to repeat the experiment all right let's go
if we were making measurements here then we would observe the same but lots of these that is the same experimental results that we did before and so would you because you are observing this experiment through with the camera which is fast into this car added you were in the moving frame of reference but now we're going to do the experiment again and this time you watched through a camera which is fixed in the poor frame of reference or concentrate on watching the clock to lecture i follow us i think you'll see that in a move faster that way and not so bad this way relative to u_n_ relative to the wall husband
here the car which was moving along in this direction with the velocity we were thinking on the card at a table here i am over on the side and uh... doctor doom was on the side and we were pushing back-and-forth on the table well i pushed it and went into this direction with the velocity v when doctor didn't want to do when in this direction the same velocity v but this is the velocity relative to the car what about the velocity relative to an observer on the ground in the picture brain well if it was pushed in this direction it's velocity to you plot being if it's in this direction it will also be used u minded b this is all very reasonable is nothing very hard to understand here the surprising thing about this expression is that it is not actor in all circumstances at very high speed by high speed i mean speeds close to the velocity of light expression breakdown at these very high speed we have to use the ideas about relative motion developed by a albert einstein in his special theory of relativity for all the speed of the we're ever likely to run into this expression you plus or minus the is completely adequate so far we've been talking about frames of reference moving at a constant velocity relative to one another now i'm going to do the experiment with the dropping ball again only that time the karte will be accelerated relative to the earth frame these weight will fall and give the cart a constant acceleration first of all out and then i'll really put the motion is very fast and i want you to watch at the point where the ball is released from the pic camera i don't know whether you thought that are not at the top of the vault with the things that was before for either prime it landed in a different spots this is because the cart kept on accelerating in this direction as the ball was falling now i'm going to let you see it again with the slow-motion camera fixed on to the car
this time you saw the bull moving off to one side falling down the vertical reference line as it did in the constant velocity case but suppose you were in the six telerate a frame of reference how could you explain this gravity is the only force acting on this fall so it should fall straight down but at the law of inertia is to hold there must be a farce pushing sideways on the ball in this direction accorded to deviate from the vertical path but what kind of a force is it it is not gravitational or an electric or nuclear force in fact it is in the force at all as we know what story left to conclude but it gets sensor is no force that could be pushing in this direction on the ball but the law governorship just does not hold this is a strange frame of reference we call a frame of reference in which the law of inertia holes and inertial the law how the nurse or holds in the third frame of reference so it is an inertial frame the car moving at constant velocity relative to the earth is an inertial frame but the car which is expel a rated is not an inertial frame because the frame of reference that we're used to living in is one in which the law of inertia holds when we go into a non inertial like the frame of the accelerated car our belief in the lava nurture is so strong but when we feed them acceleration of the ball sideways we think there is a port carpet so we make fiction but they're into force and sometimes we call this fictitious force fictitious forces arise an accelerated frames of reference the frame is accelerated in this direction so you in the frame cn acceleration of the ball in this direction and you say that there is a force cutting it
what's happening this time why doesn't the talking straight across the table i did it before how you can see it doesn't if we believe in the law of inertia but we must believe that there is an unbalanced force to change the velocity of the pot but this pope is nearly friction locks so what can be exerting this unbalanced correspondent though that you watched the motion this time through a camera which is fixed in the earth's frame of reference
i think if you concentrate on watching dot papa you can't be that it is a warning is a great time and that therefore there is no i'm not quite acting on it
now we're going to stop this rotation but i can talk to you about what is happening here i don't know about you but i'm busy in d fixed fame of reference there was no one balanced force within the frame of reference for taking in this turntable there was and unbalanced because the velocity kept changing was with the fictitious part rotating plane is unknown inertial or accelerated fame just as the accelerated frame of the karte the doctor humes showed you you know that every object which is moving in a circle has an acceleration toward the center of the circle this is the exploration of has a special namely and capital acceleration now you will this puck for a while workstudy while the turntable is rotating i'll get off theoretic i'm ready but the rotation
you concede that now the park isn't moving in a circle dr humans exerting a force to keep it moving in the circle and you can see this from the fact that the rubber ring is extended heat is exerting the center of the billboards and this is the only horizontal force acting on the part but not let's look at it again from his point of view in the rotating system he is exerting a force towards the center of the table and yet the puck is standing still produced more or less taylor some vibration how he believes in a lot of inertia so he thinks there's and equal parts on the part away from the center of the table so that there is no unbalanced boring this outward force in the pocket the fictitious sports in this case sometimes it's called the centrifugal force in the pics reference frame there is no award boris on the path now suppose the doctor doom stops exerting a barge watch the pot in the picture frame of reference the puck moves off in a straight line there's no no unbalanced boris acting on it now let's look at it again from his point of view in the rotating system when he releases the proc which to him was everest it mood the force away from the sender is now on unbalanced part on the talked to him the outward course on the part is fictitious in our food frame of reference it doesn't think that's but the doctor whom in the accelerated frame of reference it's a perfectly real force i hope by now doctor i do not have convinced you the rotating frame of reference is not in their shel frame for you've all been told that the hurt it's rotating abode of taxes and that also it travels in a nearly circular orbit around the time why then do we find in a frame of reference attached securely to the earth but the law of inertia seems to hold why don't we observed fictitious forces the five of the fictitious forces which we have to introduce in a non initial frame depends upon the acceleration of the frame these smaller the acceleration is v smaller the fictitious forces that we introduced here's a frame of reference attached to the equator of the car the acceleration of this frame is really very small because bearded spinning about it axis it has an acceleration directly inward app three d_ one hundred of a major per second square on they one kilogram at the equator their is the fictitious for us directly upwards out three one hundred but this is not by gravity which is a port downward of nine point eight new so the net downward force is smaller than that of gravity alone if i've dropped av one kilogram at the equator the acceleration would be slightly smaller than that due to gravity alone very much now the acceleration of the car in its orbit is even smaller still and produces even smaller affect in our frame of reference mike said that the earth was rotating abode faxes how do we know but this is slow well if you take a time exposure photograph of the stars they seem to be moving in circles a both p pole star but all motion is relative is there any way of telling which is moving or the stars the fact that it is because which is rotating can be demonstrated by means of the pendulum if i've got a pendulum swinging its wings back-and-forth in a plane though it turns out is this pendulum with the north pole of the art the plane of swing would remain fixed relative to the stars but would rotate relative now i'll have to show you what i need this pendulum is epicenter how this turntable which will represent europe no i was about the cable turning around in this direction i'll put a black arrow on so that you'll remember but the rotation the pendulum is that the north pole of the earth annuals motion as you ordinarily do standing on the earth the playing of swing rotates in the opposite direction from the rotation of the turntable and that exactly the same rate now look at it from the fixed cabral which will represent the frame of the stars the turntable the alert rotate but the plane of the pendulum remain specs a pendulum used for this purpose because approval pendulum use tommy dot wong at the beginning of this film
let's look back again now the focal pendulum dropped slammed as its wings i think you can see the paint line where the planned trail began the amplitude upswing is decreasing the famed trail is not long now but the important thing to speak is that the plane upswing has been rotating during the half hour that we've been talking to you an inertial frame of reference is one in which the alarm inner cities without all frames of reference moving at a constant velocity with respect to an inertial frame are also inertial frame we use the word as an inertial frame of reference but it is only approximately one a small acceleration with respect to the stars for example the frame of reference other stars is the best we can do when we look for a frame of reference which is for all practical purposes bextra accelerated frame of reference is not a member shall frame and when we are in an accelerated frame we have to introduce forces which we called fictitious forces in order that the law of inertia and the other laws of physics don't change
Wow!
3 guys hit me up on "Growlr" no face pics though, just "Dick shots"
How are you suppose to tell who they are?
"Dick shots?"
OK the black guy, that's Craig.
He works out at the same gym as us. he's that guy whose always on the elliptical staring at people.
Oh!
OK, the uncut one is Habib, at the 7-11.
Your cruising guys at the 7-11?
OK, the third, the curved one
Oooh, that's Owen, total freak, stay away from him!
Wow!!
You are like the "Dick Whisperer"
I'm here to help.
I can't believe this happening!
What's wrong Nelson?
Did your hot muscle bear cub break up with you already?
Wow!
I thought it would last at least til Friday!
Nelson, you know I love you, but you really need to focus on Chasers looking for Sugar Daddies!
Ya, you love sugar!
No kidding.
One more snickers bar and he's be popping Januvia with Paula Dean!
(laughing)
Are you finished?!
That was Detective Winters!
J Cub's death has been reclassified a homicide!
What!
How?
He didn't give me any details!
But that means the 3 of us are suspects!
We've got to figure out what happened before we are all end up in prison getting raped!
(laughter)
Oh, honey, I don't think you have much to worry about.
But you know what?
You and me, we would totally have to watch our backs!
Oh my god, us!
We would totally get raped!
Right?
Yes!!
You don't have to worry.
What are we doing?
The cops combed this place.
If there was a clue laying around, they would have found it.
Oh, look what I found!
How did Detective Winters miss that?
When you're that hot, you don't have to be too good at anything.
Do you think this was J Cub's drink?
Maybe.
Do you think maybe he was poisoned?
There were no signs of trauma or bruising.
It kind of makes sense.
Oh my god!
We should turn this over to the Police.
No we shouldn't.
What, and in incriminate us?
No, we need to figure out another way that J Cub could have been poisoned.
But Detective Winters isn't talking.
I mean, who are we gonna call?
How about the LA County Coroner who did the autopsy.
Sure, Wood.
I've got her on speed dial along with the Governor.
Oh, you know her too?
You don't know her.
Oh, ya, ya ya!
I went to high school with her.
She was my beard at prom.
We double dated with her best friend and the tight end from the football team. a tight end?
Not after we dropped the girls off.
Oh my god!
That's Him!
That's Detective Winters.
He's here to arrest us!
I've got the glass!
I've got the evidence!
What do we do?
Hide it!
Hide the glass!
Ooh, I get handcuffed first!
I can't go to prison.
I can't!
The food is god awful!
Oh, thank God!
Todd.
Hey guys it's cool. It's my boyfriend Todd.
Right, like it's really his boyfriend Todd.
Wow.
Hey, what are you doing here?
Well, I texted you earlier. and left a voicemail.
But now that i'm standing here on your doorstep. I kind of feel like a stalker.
Come on in.
Move it Lurch!
Make way for my lover.
So, did the Police contact you?
Yeah but you know, I've just been really busy lately.
Totally reasonable explanation.
No need to ever talk about it again.
Hey, are you available for dinner tonight?
Yes
Oh, wait a minute.
No, actually I'm not.
Well, I teach this seminar.
It's for children who audition for Disney channel shows.
Not Nickelodeon though.
Because, Miranda Cosgrove took out a restraining order against me.
It's this really long embarrassing story.
Anyway
But it's all about me sharing the gift.
Sweet.
What about tomorrow night then?
Absolutely!
Great!
God you taste good.
You too.
Oh right.
Well...
Then I guess I will see you tomorrow night.
Guys.
And remember, don't leave me hanging.
I know where you live.
Too busy to talk to the cops, but free to take Nelson to dinner?
Are we being punked?!
I've got pre-cum.
Tell me not to do it.
Tell me not to go!!
Miss JaeKyung is looking for Miss Geum JanDi.
It seems the groom is running way too late...
The groom is entering.
The bride is entering.
Starting now, the ceremony for the union of Goo JunPyo and Ha JaeKyung will begin.
To this couple comes marriage and the union of the bride and groom.
If anyone objects, please speak now, or forever hold your peace.
The Lord . . .
What are you doing right now?
I...
I object to this wedding.
Miss JaeKyung!
JaeKyung, what are you doing?!
I, bride Ha JaeKyung, object to this wedding.
Wh-What?
Aren't there any others who object?
I also object.
I also object.
Me too.
Me too.
I also object.
Miss JaeKyung.
This joke seems a little overboard.
Having fun is fine, but...
Madam Chairman, also Mom and Dad;
This isn't a joke.
I can't go along with this marriage to Goo JunPyo.
No matter how much I think about it, marriage just doesn't suit me right now.
I'm sorry.
Because of my conduct, I've caused a lot of trouble.
Dad.
Because this is all my fault, please don't take it out on Shinhwa Group.
Madam Chairman. and
Goo JunPyo,
I'm sincerely sorry.
Please forgive me.
Unbelievable.
What happened?
I'm usually a pretty cool girl.
Unni!
Oh yeah, Chen...
Chen, how's it going?
We're bringing her there right now.
Goo JunPyo!
JanDi.
Until when are you going to keep crying?
If someone saw, I would look like the bad guy.
Where can you find something more than a beautiful happy ending?
JaeKyung unni is so cool.
That day...
You asked why I didn't go, didn't you?
I... don't believe in happy endings.
Are you ok ?
This is why I always tell you to be careful all the time!
Sorry. I'm okay..
You have guests, so I'll get going.
Weren't you waiting because you had something to tell me?
I have a favor to ask.
JanDi...
I can't let her go.
Even though I always make things hard for her.
I've sometimes thought it might be better to let her go to you.
I didn't even want to think about it, but if I had to
I thought you should be the one.
It can't be anyone else but you, JiHoo.
Goo JunPyo.
Even so, I don't think I can.
This lawn (JanDi) is the same as usual.
I missed it.
Don't you regret it? I do.
I've been regretting the moment I let Goo JunPyo go.
JiHoo, I was supporting you, but . . . It's now a waste since I gave up.
So I can't even do that. Not long ago,
I asked JunPyo:
"Between friendship and love,
If you were to pick only one,
What would you choose?".
He said he wouldn't give up either
They say people get as much as they are greedy for.
Neither you nor I have enough greed.
I'm leaving for New York tomorrow.
Can you give this to JanDi for me?
That J J
You have no idea how much I hoped it meant JiHoo and JanDi.
JiHoo, you probably don't know.
Good luck!
Take care.
Miss prepared this so that you can be comfortable.
Excuse me.
Please give this message to JaeKyung unni.
If it's okay with her, nothing has changed with our sister relationship.
Eat.
Miss Geum JanDi.
Would you like to dance with me?
I can't dance.
There's something I've been wanting to ask you from the beginning.
What is it?
Why was it me?
Me, I'm not pretty, I don' t have money or anything.
Why do you even like me?
Because I have everything.
What?
Because I have money, status, and looks. I have all that.
I don't need anything.
Geum JanDi, all you need to be is Geum JanDi.
It's really pretty.
Do you see the brightest star right there? Yeah.
It's a star called Sirius in the Orion Constellation.
The brightest star in the winter sky. You could say its existence looks like Goo JunPyo.
How? Then I'm that one. That one, that one, that one!
I want to be that one. You sure do have taste. Thats the second brightest star, Procyon.
You're always so outgoing and obnoxious It suits you perfectly. What?
When I was little, my Dad sent me a telescope for my birthday.
He wrote in the card: study the stars well and we'll go look at them together.
No.
I never went, not even once.
Why not?
Believing in that promise, I studied enough to go to major in astronomy, but do you know what I got for Christmas a few years later?
A telescope.
It was then that I realized it wasn't my Father sending those gifts, but his secretary.
Do you know what my dream is?
In the future, going to see the stars with your son. How lame!
Not making promises I can't keep.
JanDi.
I'm sorry for hurting you.
JanDi.
What now?
I love you. Look at this bliss.
When did you arrive?
JanDi!
GaEul!
It's a relief. What is?
That you're smiling. Here. This...
Where is she right now?
She's about to depart.
Miss, it's time to go in.
Unni! JaeKyung unni!
Hey, monkey!
JanDi!
Goo JoonPyo! How did you get here?
How can you just leave like this?
You weren't going to say goodbye to your little sis?
What kind of unni does that?
Sorry!
I'm really weak when it comes to saying goodbye.
Even the fierce Ha JaeKyung had a weak point? That's right.
Have a safe journey. And... Thanks.
If you guys break up, I'll die from the injustice of it.
So, if you want to break up, come report to me and get permission. Got it? Unni...
I'm leaving.
Have an enjoyable flight.
This is mine.
I picked it though. I had dibs on it first.
Hurry, let go!
What are you?
Hey!
Hurry up and apologize, you jerk!
Get down!
Apologize!
Hurry!
I know this also, originally belonged to JanDi. But, just this one thing, this one thing, give it to me, please.
Don't you think I should have at least one special memory to treasure?
Shinhwa Group and JK's merger has become uncertain, and the stock market and the government are watching Shinhwa's movements.
Shinhwa Group had planned to become in-laws with the American-based JK. Now due to the broken engagement, Shinhwa is... Hey.
Open the door! Hey! I said open the door!
Hey. Can't you hear me?
I said open the door!
This time, shouldn't you just come to my house?
What's the point of getting another house?
Who's to know whether that Evil Witch might tear down your house or kick you out in the middle of the night?
I should probably pack my belongings right away. I'm really in trouble. There's no need for that.
I knew you were something else, but I didn't see you as someone who could pretend to be innocent, yet run around doing these kind of sly things behind people's backs.
It really is unbelievable.
It was my fault that I couldn't completely take care of things, but
I didn't know I would regret it so much. Excuse me! Why are you treating JanDi like this?
JanDi did nothing, but actually helped the two of them so they could work out. If you have eyes, look at it.
Because of a worthless thing like you, do you know how huge a problem has been created?
A child like you couldn't even imagine the amount of damage that you've caused.
Look at what you have done to our household!
I'm not going to just sit back and suffer anymore. It'd be best if you don't think I'll let things go like I have been.
I will make sure that you realize and understand and come to regret how monstrous a problem you've created. isn't this what you wanted? Hey there! It seems you're going a bit too far in the way you're talking to the child.
Grandpa!
Sir, how did you come to be here?
It's been a while, Shi Su.
Or do I need to call you Chairwoman Kang now? You've changed a lot. Let's talk about us later.
Let's talk about her first.
How do you know that child?
She's going to be my granddaughter-in-law.
What do you mean?
She's the girl I picked just for JiHoo.
Grandfather!
Are you serious?
Until now, I just kept an eye on her, but now, she's no different than family.
I would appreciate it if you didn't treat her so carelessly in the future.
JanDi, what are you doing?
Get your bags and follow me! Y-Y-Yes. Sunbae.
Starting today, she's going to be living with us. What? JiHoo, what are you doing?
You should be showing her to her room. I came because Grandfather dragged me here, but I can go to GaEul's tomorrow.
You kids!
Who said you two, all grown up boy and girl, could be in the same room together with the door closed?
Grandfather, I'm sorry and I'm grateful.
I'll spend the night here today.
Don't think about running away, and there's nothing to be grateful for. You're the person that forced me into this house with that kid. I brought you here to punish you.
Do you know how hard it is for me to walk on eggshells around that grandson of mine?
Grandfather and Sunbae are . . . and I'm-
If you have caused trouble, then you should take the blame for it and accept your punishment. JanDi might feel uncomfortable here.
It's not you who's uncomfortable?
I don't know anything about young people and their feelings being such and such.
I suppose things will happen as fate wills it to. But that child has no place under heaven to go.
I want to become a guardian for that child. There's nothing to like or be uncomfortable about. But for like a child like Jandi to be paired with someone as stoic as you...
That day, do you know what I was doing?
I have a favor to ask.
Favor? Tomorrow morning, by 7 come here to this place. Don't ask me for a reason.
What is this? I'm leaving. YiJung!
I really hope that you'll come out. &lt;i&gt;Mother
What is it now? A farewell trip?
And if I get him for you? What's the use?
Mom. Can't you just let him go now? Please.
Please get in.
To be honest, I have a favor to ask of you, Miss Jandi. A favor?
Whenever you have spare time, as a part-time job,
Can you come visit this person? Me?
You can tell him stories or you can just show your face once in a while.
Who is this person?
To me, he's like an older brother. He's the same as family.
But why did you ask me to do this?
Because what this person needs the most...is warmth.
If I tell you that among the people I've met, Jandi, you seem to be the warmest person, would that be an answer?
Of course, you will be adequately compensated. Oh, no! If it is something I can help with, then of course, I'll do it.
This is a personal favor; neither the young master nor the Chairwoman must find out. Okay. Okay.
Hello.
It's nice to meet you.
My name is Geum JanDi. Though I'm lacking in much, I'll be a good friend to you. Starting today, let's get along with each other.
Young Master. What happened to JanDi? Is she okay?
Dr. Yoon took her to his house. To JiHoo's house? Right now, that is the safest place she can be.
My heart keeps feeling anguished. &lt;i&gt; Goo JunPyo Jan Di. WooBin Sunbae.
These days feel like death warmed over. YiJung is acting like an invalid. JoonPyo's under house arrest.
He's just not allowed to go out. He destroyed a wedding in front of that important figure. It'd be even weirder if nothing happened.
Ah! As for me, well, I'm doing really well. What?
The worst kind of encounter is the fish meeting, because meeting leaves a horrible fishy smell. The encounter one must be most careful with is the flower meeting. Because when it blooms, it has a wonderful fragrance, but when it wilts, it is thrown away.
I really like this phrase, a handkerchief-like meeting. Sir, how was it with you?
It would be great if I could be like a handkerchief to you. Don't you think? Isn't that right, sir?
You have to let me pay you back for trimming my hair.
It's a car wash!
I wanted to tell you.
That...
I love you.
I wanted to say it out loud like that. That is all.
Are you quitting?
Are you really going to run away like this?
Do you think that this is what that person wants?
It doesn't matter anymore.
It matters to me.
In order to make your heart strong so that it isn't easily broken you said I needed to be molded, and shaped and burned in fiery oven; to endure that.
So that you don't have any regrets.
You said that.
It was all nonsense.
It's not over yet.
You haven't done everything yet.
I can't give up like this.
I'm going to make this hand move again.
I just need to get in.
Go over there.
Thank you.
Take care.
Hey, GaEul.
What's wrong?
Are you okay?
Hey!
What are you doing these days?
You haven't been sleeping and you've been coming out before the crack of dawn.
Tell me.
What's wrong?
Is it something I can help you with?
Don't worry.
I only have a little more to do before it's over.
Are you ready?
Yeah.
Okay.
Let's move out.
One.
Two.
Three.
I'm going out with my friend.
Whether you decide to follow or not, do whatever you want.
Then we shall go as well.
Manager Lee, you're ready, right?
Catch them! &lt;BR&gt; Hey!
You almost caused an accident.
Don't worry and do whatever you need.
I'll take good care of him.
Mom will be right back.
Have fun with Noona.
Please take care of him.
Say "Bye, Mom." Bye, Mom.
Take care.
Let's have fun.
Gu JunPyo!
Are you okay?
Right now?
I'm tired.
What is it?
This isn't an 'it', it's a kid.
We haven't seen each other in forever, why on earth would you bring a little leech with you?
Did you adopt him from somewhere?
Noona, let's go here.
Okay, let's go.
I was wondering why you asked to meet at a zoo.
Is that little leech more important than I am?
If you don't want to be a leech yourself, then stop whining and follow me. Let's go.
Next, we have contestant #4.
This is Nelson!
Let's here it for Nelson everyone!
So, Nelson, why don't you tell us a little bit about yourself.
Well, Todd, I'm an Aquarian!
I just celebrated my 40th Birthday!
I pride myself on being very humble.
And I'm amazing in bed!!
Thank you.
Oh right, let's here it for Nelson!
I said, let's here it for Nelson!
That's more like it!
Oh, ooh, J-Cubs locker.
This has got to be his backpack.
Phone.
Okay uh... it looks like he records some voice memos.
Hold on.
Meet Bruce Daniels at Akbar on Friday the 16th at 7:00PM to go over my set.
Okay, Bruce Daniels, he's that Stand up at Akbar.
It sounds like J-Cub was trying to be a comic or something.
Oh, and the 17th.
That was the night of our party.
The combination to the safe is 12, 16, 82.
Ramone doesn't think I know it, but I do.
You know, Cyril said something about J-Cub doing accounting work for Ramone, But you know, obviously I couldn't understand most of it cause his accent is thicker than Borat's.
You know what, I will go open the safe and I'll take pictures with my phone of everything.
And then maybe something is in there that will be valuable information for us.
Great idea, are you going to remember the combination?
I have a photogenic memory.
A photographic memory!
And believe me, it's not pretty.
So the cops were here tonight!
They were asking all sorts of questions.
J-Cub's murder is all over the news.
I don't have to tell you how bad this is going to be for us
If they stay focused on this club.
We've got to keep a low profile.
They can't pin anything on you Mr. Santiago.
They go no proof.
Well, if they look hard enough, they'll find proof.
Why did I ever get involved with that kid!
He was the one who was all over you, Boss.
Look, I don't need a kiss ass right now. Okay, Thor!
I have to keep this contained, or else we are all screwed!
Boss, we need you out here.
Get out of the way!
Oh my God!
Did you hear that?
They are totally involved.
No, no, no.
They're not involved.
Ramone was involved with J-Cub, but now he regrets it.
I'm talking about the murder!!
He basically admitted killing him.
Oh, I did not get that.
Yeah, I know!
That was fast.
Did you find anything in the safe?
I forgot the combination.
I thought you said you have a photographic memory!
I do.
But J-Cub said the number.
I need to see it, so that it is like a photograph in my mind.
Okay, here's a pen.
Write it on your hand so you don't forget.
Gotcha.
What is it?
It's 12 - 16 - 82.
12 - 16 - 82.
Right 12 - 16 - 82.
12 - 16 - 82.
12 - 16 - 82.
I got it! good.
I forgot it again.
It doesn't matter.
You wrote it on your hand.
You can just look at it.
Good point.
Oh, my God.
Alright you guys. Let's bring up our contestants for the last time.
Come on everybody!
Contestant #1.
Contestant #2.
Contestant #3.
And contestant #4.
What's up?
God you're hot!
Hold on, one second.
Do not leave!
I just have to take this really fast.
Hey, What?
What? I'm a little busy right now!
Trust me.
You're gonna want to hear this.
No, no, no. Please...don't.
Okay, this better be good!
What?!
Meet me outside.
Alright, I took pictures of everything in the safe.
You wouldn't believe what he keeps in there.
Just money, valuables, like important looking documents.
I didn't see any porn!
Okay, I'll get Nelson.
We'll meet you outside.
So There you have it. Those are our contestants.
And now it is time to crown our Mr. Bear Chest 2012!
Remember. The volume of your applause is what decides our winner here. So...
Let's here it for Contestant #1.
Alright, let's here it for Contestant #2.
Alright, now we have Contestant #3.
And finally, Contestant #4.
Let's here it for Contestant #4.
Nelson, you are our Mr. Bear Chest 2012!!!
Give it up for him!
Come on! #4!
There you go!!
We're going to go on a dive to the deep sea, and anyone that's had that lovely opportunity knows that for about two and half hours on the way down, it's a perfectly positively pitch-black world.
And we used to see the most mysterious animals out the window that you couldn't describe: these blinking lights -- a world of bioluminescence, like fireflies.
Dr. Edith Widder -- she's now at the Ocean Research and Conservation Association -- was able to come up with a camera that could capture some of these incredible animals, and that's what you're seeing here on the screen. That's all bioluminescence.
Like I said: just like fireflies.
There's a flying turkey under a tree.
(Laughter)
I'm a geologist by training.
And you see, some of the bioluminescence they use to avoid being eaten, some they use to attract prey, but all of it, from an artistic point of view, is just positively amazing.
And a lot of what goes on inside -- There's a fish with glowing eyes, pulsating eyes.
Some of the colors are designed to hypnotize, these lovely patterns.
And then this last one, one of my favorites, this pinwheel design.
Just absolutely amazing, every single dive.
That's the unknown world, and today we've only explored about 3 percent of what's out there in the ocean.
Already we've found the world's highest mountains, the world's deepest valleys, underwater lakes, underwater waterfalls -- a lot of that we shared with you from the stage.
And in a place where we thought no life at all, we find more life, we think, and diversity and density than the tropical rainforest, which tells us that we don't know much about this planet at all.
There's still 97 percent, and either that 97 percent is empty or just full of surprises.
But I want to jump up to shallow water now and look at some creatures that are positively amazing.
Cephalopods -- head-foots.
As a kid I knew them as calamari, mostly.
(Laughter) This is an octopus.
This is the work of Dr. Roger Hanlon at the Marine Biological Lab, and it's just fascinating how cephalopods can, with their incredible eyes, sense their surroundings, look at light, look at patterns.
Here's an octopus moving across the reef, finds a spot to settle down, curls up and then disappears into the background. Tough thing to do.
In the next bit, we're going to see a couple squid.
Now males, when they fight, if they're really aggressive, they turn white.
And these two males are fighting. They do it by bouncing their butts together, which is an interesting concept.
Now, here's a male on the left and a female on the right, and the male has managed to split his coloration so the female only always sees the kinder, gentler squid in him.
(Laughter)
Let's take a look at it again.
Watch the coloration: white on the right, brown on the left.
He takes a step back, he's keeping off the other males by splitting his body, and comes up on the other side --
Bingo!
Now, I'm told that's not not just a squid phenomenon with males, but I don't know.
Cuttlefish.
I love cuttlefish.
This is a Giant Australian Cuttlefish.
And there he is, his droopy little eyes up here.
But they can do pretty amazing things, too.
Here we're going to see one backing into a crevice, and watch his tentacles -- he just pulls them in, makes them look just like algae.
Disappears right into the background.
Positively amazing.
Here's two males fighting. Once again, they're smart enough, these cephalopods; they know not to hurt each other.
But look at the patterns that they can do with their skin.
That's an amazing thing.
Here's an octopus. Sometimes they don't want to be seen when they move, because predators can see them.
This guy can make himself look like a rock, and, looking at his environment, can actually slide across the bottom, using the waves and the shadows so he can't be seen.
His motion blends right into the background -- the moving rock trick.
So, we're learning lots new from the shallow water.
Still exploring the deep, but learning lots from the shallow water.
There's a good reason why: the shallow water's full of predators -- here's a barracuda -- and if you're an octopus or a cephalopod, you need to really understand how to use your surroundings to hide.
In the next scene, you're going to see a nice coral bottom.
And you see that an octopus would stand out very easily there if you couldn't use your camouflage, use your skin to change color and texture.
Here's some algae in the foreground -- and an octopus.
Ain't that amazing?
Now, Roger spooked him, so he took off in a cloud of ink, and when he lands, the octopus says, "Oh, I've been seen.
The best thing to do is to get as big as I can get."
That big brown makes his eyespot very big.
So, he's bluffing.
Let's do it backwards.
I thought he was joking when he first showed it to me.
I thought it was all graphics.
So here it is in reverse. Watch the skin color; watch the skin texture.
Just an amazing animal, it can change color and texture to match the surroundings.
Watch him blend right into this algae.
One, two, three.
(Applause)
And now he's gone, and so am I. Thank you very much.
So the type of magic I like, and I'm a magician, is magic that uses technology to create illusions.
So I would like to show you something I've been working on.
It's an application that I think will be useful for artists -- multimedia artists in particular.
It synchronizes videos across multiple screens of mobile devices.
I borrowed these three iPods from people here in the audience to show you what I mean.
And I'm going to use them to tell you a little bit about my favorite subject: deception.
(Music)
One of my favorite magicians is Karl Germain.
He had this wonderful trick where a rosebush would bloom right in front of your eyes.
But it was his production of a butterfly that was the most beautiful.
(Recording) Announcer:
Ladies and gentlemen, the creation of life.
(Applause) (Music)
Announcer:
Magic is the only honest profession.
A magician promises to deceive you -- and he does.
MT: I like to think of myself as an honest magician.
I use a lot of tricks, which means that sometimes I have to lie to you.
Now I feel bad about that.
But people lie every day.
(Ringing) Hold on.
Phone:
Hey, where are you? MT:
Stuck in traffic.
I'll be there soon.
You've all done it.
(Laughter) (Music)
Right: I'll be ready in just a minute, darling.
Center:
It's just what I've always wanted.
Left:
You were great.
MT: Deception, it's a fundamental part of life.
Now polls show that men tell twice as many lies as women -- assuming the women they asked told the truth.
(Laughing)
We deceive to gain advantage and to hide our weaknesses.
The Chinese general Sun Tzu said that all war was based on deception.
Oscar Wilde said the same thing of romance.
Some people deceive for money.
Let's play a game.
Three cards, three chances.
Announcer:
One five will get you 10, 10 will get you 20.
Now, where's the lady?
Where is the queen?
MT: This one?
Sorry.
You lose.
Well, I didn't deceive you.
You deceived yourself.
Self-deception.
That's when we convince ourselves that a lie is the truth.
Sometimes it's hard to tell the two apart.
Compulsive gamblers are experts at self-deception.
(Slot machine)
They believe they can win.
They forget the times they lose.
The brain is very good at forgetting.
Bad experiences are quickly forgotten.
Bad experiences quickly disappear.
Which is why in this vast and lonely cosmos, we are so wonderfully optimistic.
Our self-deception becomes a positive illusion -- why movies are able to take us onto extraordinary adventures; why we believe Romeo when he says he loves Juliet; and why single notes of music, when played together, become a sonata and conjure up meaning.
That's "Clair De lune."
Its composer, called Debussy, said that art was the greatest deception of all.
Art is a deception that creates real emotions -- a lie that creates a truth.
And when you give yourself over to that deception, it becomes magic.
(Music fades slowly) (Applause) Thank you.
Thank you very much.
The government is monitoring private phone calls your children and my children's private phone calls and tracking who their associates are.
This June we learned that out private lives are no longer private.
The US government is secretly tracking the emails purchases, text messages, location and phone calls of people all over the world.
Ed Rooney, Ed?
This is George Peterson... With code names like PRlSM and XKEYSCORE, this network of monitoring programs is just one part of largest surveillance system in history.
This open-ended surveillance system is illegal and operates in total secrecy.
Under the system, the government can know where you've been, where you are, and where you're going.
The program was only exposed when former NSA contractor Edward Snowden leaked documents detailing the extensive data collection.
I've got information man, new shit is come to light.
The president, the NSA and their lawyers have tried to deflect the public outrage by distorting the facts and misleading the public about the process.
US courts have never allowed the government to run a spying program of this scale.
So how did this happen?
Well, lets take a step back, for a minute.
America's founders hated oppressive British surveillance and unreasonable search and seizure. the issue here is independence.
Understanding that privacy was necessary to almost every basic right in our constitution, they established the fourth amendment.
The fourth amendment exist to prevent the government from tracking or searching your personal information, unless they have good reason to believe a crime is happening.
It's all there black and white, clear as crystal.
Using the NSA the US government is violating the highest law of the country, the Constitution.
Government surveillance has gone on for decades, but things got a lot worse in 2001, when the US congress passed the Patriot Act, giving secret FlSA courts more authority to grant surveillance requests on a large scale.
Instead of getting a warrant for an individual person suspected of crime the governement could now search a large list of persons.
Even those under the no suspicion of criminal activity.
FlSA courts aren't required to disclose what court orders are being approved and supporting evidence isn't needed.
Of the 1,789 request for authorization, one was withdrawn by the government.
All the other ones were granted
It's a rubber stamp.
All of this is protected by secrecy, with no system for checks and balances.
If the NSA is collecting information on you based on what you read, or the websites you go to you'll likely never know or get to stop it no matter who you are.
Programs like PRlSM, completely ignore the purpose of warrants while claiming to work within the law.
The US government has turned the internet we love into something it was never intended to be... ...a tool for surveilling everyone.
This is the most essential problem.
Through these secret courts and secret interpretations of the laws, US government agents can illegally track internet users based on things like keywords, Analysts who use a system for a web portal at Fort Mead, key in selectors or search terms that are designed to produce at least 51% confidence in a targets foreign-ness.
Data has been collected for years on the most popular websites, gmail, facebook, yahoo, and many more.
There's 1000s of words that government tracks.
Words like "marijuana"
Almost any email you send might get your account monitored.
This kind of tracking can make you second guess what you say.
That's why mass spying is unconstitutional.
Abuses are inevitable and data leaks are already happening.
Spying on our internet usage gives the government power over our lives.
What happens to free speech, free association, or a free press, when everyone is under constant surveillance, even in our most private moments.
Experts on surveillance, privacy and intelligence agree on one thing.
The NSA, Presidents Bush and Obama and their secret courts are interpreting multiple laws in a way that most Americans would find shocking.
This is allowing the kind of surveillance and collection that the Constitution was not meant to allow.
These programs break the law.
They violate the fourth amendment and they strip us of our privacy.
The US Constitution was written to prevent government surveillance programs like PRlSM.
It's up to us to demand that these ideals be upheld.
Help us stop the NSA, restore the Constitution and keep the world free.
Find the sum of -15 + (-46) + (-29)
To do this, let's just first visualize what each of these numbers look like.
So I'm going to draw a number line for each of them.
If this is 0, and let's say this is -15. I can represent -15 as an arrow that points from 0 to -15.
The length of the arrow is the absolute value of this.
It's the distance from 0.
So the absolute value is 15.
Once again let me draw my number line. Put 0 is going to be right over there. and -46 is going to be someplace over here. Notice the same exact idea
The distance between -46 and 0 or another way to think that is the absolute value of -46.
This distance right over here is going to be 46. And its direction is to the left. That's why we get to the number -46.
The absolute value says how far you are to the left or the right of 0.
Finally let me do the same thing for -29.
Say this is 0, -29 is going to be roughly over here.
So this length right over here is 29 and it is to the left that is why it is -29.
So we have represented all of these numbers and you can see what their absolute values are like.
And now let's think what happens if you add them.
So let's do that. Let's draw that.
First we have -15.
Then we are going to go 46 spaces to the left, to get us to -15 + (-46)
Then we're going to go 46 to the left. That's about that far.
I am starting off where the -15 started or where the -15 left off. and then I am putting that arrow after that.
And we don't know yet what number this gets us to.
We know the length of this magenta arrow is 15.
So when all is said and done, where are we?
Well, the total length that we are to the left, is going to be 15+46+29.
Look this is the same thing as abs(-15)+abs(-46)+abs(-29)
15+46+29 is equal to...let's see.
So this entire length here is 90.
But it is not 90 to the right.
But this is 90 to the left.
So one way to think about it is, these are all the same sign.
So this is going to be equal to the -( abs(-15)+abs(-46)+abs(-29)) and the reason why we are writing this. this might look fancy but this is really just the length of this purple arrow.
So this is 15+46+29, gives us 90. But it's to the left. So that is why it is -90.
What I'd like to show you today is something in the way of an experiment.
Today's its debut.
It's a demonstration of augmented reality.
And the visuals you're about to see are not prerecorded.
They are live and reacting to me in real time.
I like to think of it as a kind of technological magic.
So fingers crossed.
And keep your eyes on the big screen.
Augmented reality is the melding of the real world with computer-generated imagery.
It seems the perfect medium to investigate magic and ask, why, in a technological age, we continue to have this magical sense of wonder.
Magic is deception, but it is a deception we enjoy.
To enjoy being deceived, an audience must first suspend its disbelief.
It was the poet Samuel Taylor Coleridge who first suggested this receptive state of mind.
Samuel Taylor Coleridge: I try to convey a semblance of truth in my writing to produce for these shadows of the imagination a willing suspension of disbelief that, for a moment, constitutes poetic faith.
This faith in the fictional is essential for any kind of theatrical experience.
Without it, a script is just words.
Augmented reality is just the latest technology.
And sleight of hand is just an artful demonstration of dexterity.
We are all very good at suspending our disbelief.
We do it every day, while reading novels, watching television or going to the movies.
We willingly enter fictional worlds where we cheer our heroes and cry for friends we never had.
Without this ability there is no magic.
It was Jean Robert-Houdin, France's greatest illusionist, who first recognized the role of the magician as a storyteller.
He said something that I've posted on the wall of my studio.
Jean Robert-Houdin:
A conjurer is not a juggler.
He is an actor playing the part of a magician.
Which means magic is theater and every trick is a story.
The tricks of magic follow the archetypes of narrative fiction.
There are tales of creation and loss, death and resurrection, and obstacles that must be overcome.
Now many of them are intensely dramatic.
Magicians play with fire and steel, defy the fury of the buzzsaw, dare to catch a bullet or attempt a deadly escape.
But audiences don't come to see the magician die, they come to see him live.
Because the best stories always have a happy ending.
The tricks of magic have one special element.
They are stories with a twist.
Now Edward de Bono argued that our brains are pattern matching machines.
He said that magicians deliberately exploit the way their audiences think.
Stage magic relies almost wholly on the momentum error.
The audience is led to make assumptions or elaborations that are perfectly reasonable, but do not, in fact, match what is being done in front of them.
MT:
In that respect, magic tricks are like jokes.
Jokes lead us down a path to an expected destination.
But when the scenario we have imagined suddenly flips into something entirely unexpected, we laugh.
The same thing happens when people watch magic tricks.
The finale defies logic, gives new insight into the problem, and audiences express their amazement with laughter.
It's fun to be fooled.
One of the key qualities of all stories is that they're made to be shared.
We feel compelled to tell them.
When I do a trick at a party -- (Laughter) that person will immediately pull their friend over and ask me to do it again.
They want to share the experience.
That makes my job more difficult, because, if I want to surprise them, I need to tell a story that starts the same, but ends differently -- a trick with a twist on a twist.
It keeps me busy.
Now experts believe that stories go beyond our capacity for keeping us entertained.
We think in narrative structures.
We connect events and emotions and instinctively transform them into a sequence that can be easily understood.
It's a uniquely human achievement.
We all want to share our stories, whether it is the trick we saw at the party, the bad day at the office or the beautiful sunset we saw on vacation.
Today, thanks to technology, we can share those stories as never before, by email, Facebook, blogs, tweets, on TED.com.
The tools of social networking, these are the digital campfires around which the audience gathers to hear our story.
We turn facts into similes and metaphors, and even fantasies.
We polish the rough edges of our lives so that they feel whole.
Our stories make us the people we are and, sometimes, the people we want to be.
They give us our identity and a sense of community.
And if the story is a good one, it might even make us smile.
Thank you.
(Applause)
Thank you.

The Shinwha group has selected as one of the biggest sponsors for the 2012 olympics ..
In the middle of a global financial crisis . .
Since the start of the Korean economic development. a single company has been holding the highest ranking continuing with its ever continuous growth. Shinhwa has finally been established in the international market as a world-class company. ...And that company is Shinhwa.
From electronics...oil refining and automobiles... to delivery...and telecommunications, and even if you're a Korean who doesn't know the President's name, you would have definitely have come across the words "ShinHwa."
It is a massive empire; a model of Korean conglomerate.
The day ShinHwa achieved an unprecedented $10 billion in export.... Instead of accepting a medal of honor, the founder was invited to the Blue House, and it was there that he said,
"Mr. President...please let me build a school for my grandchildren."
Incorporated Association, ShinHwa Academy....
The school is the first of its kind to be seen in the history of Korean education it was During a time when economic development was more important than equal opportunities in education the president even spared every expense and even passed special laws to make his school a reality.
Now there's even a saying that a family won't get anywhere without a ShinHwa graduate..
ShinHwa is based on built by the top 1% of Korean society, for the top 1% of society.
Also, Enrollment is so competitive that even most upper class children would be unable to receive acceptance even if they were to apply for registration the moment after their birth.
However, once enrolled, students can attend ShinHwa from elementary, middle and high school all the way to university.
For all the Korean students and parents frustrated by college entrance exams, ShinHwa is both the object of their hatred and envy of every citizen.
However, in this school for the chosen sons and daughters of God.. something beyond anyone's imagination is happening..
Oh, poor MinHa...what shall we do about this?
You bastard!
Aish.Damn it! Get him! Get him!
How may I help you?
I have a delivery from JanDi's Dry Cleaning Service....
Okay, you may go in.
Thank you!
Ahh this isn't it
Find him!!!
There!!
There he is! Get him! wahh..Is this really a school?
Hey, he's on the rooftop!
Lee Min Ha is going to jump! whoah..Are you serious?
Is he putting on a show? No, this is for real!!
Really?
Are you for real??
Lee MinHa??? oh!!!
Lee MinHa!
I was right, huh? He couldn't even last a week.
But he did survive three days.
It wasn't even three days. Exactly speaking . . .
This is what you guys wanted... right?
Fine,.... I'll do as you guys wish.
Hey! Hey!
Wait a moment, Lee Min Ah!!!!
Oh no,...what a customer!!
Who are you???
Me?
Oh, hehhh. i'm . . . i have a delivery for you!
JanDi Cleaners. It is $30.
Oh ,my God! This is funny!!
OK, OK, $25.!
The gym suit is free. In return, you should be a patron..
After I die, settle it with my family...
Oh! Don't be like that...
D-d-die??!?
Are you going to die right now??
Why??
I mean..come on..
You attend such a great school!
This isnt a school...
This is hell..
Excuse me!!
The real hell is out there. ..
Have you ever heard about the hell of college entrance exams??
Have you ever heard of F4???
F..F.. what?
F4?? ....What is that???
Once you get their red card, you become the target of all the students in school...
Just like me...
So are you gonna just sit back and take it??
Losers like that always move around in large groups doing cruel things..
If it was my school, I would catch them and kick all of their asses!!
How lucky... your friends are....
Huh??
Your friends, they're lucky to have a friend like you..
Not really. hahaha.
NOOOO!!
At the cradle of privileged education...ShinHwa High School, saving an ostracized student was.. neither a son of chaebol nor of honorable family.. but an ordinary girl who was there to deliver laundry.!
The sons of God who are exempt from college entrance by way of wealth!!
If you guys have nothing to do...you should try taking the SAT!!
If such a thing should come from privilege, it deserves capital punishment! ShinHwa group.. should blow itself up!
As a parent, I can't forgive them.
I refuse to continue shopping at ShinHwa Mart.!!
ShinHwa Group, give us an explanation! Give us an explanation!
Give us an explanation!!
ShinHwa Group, give us an explanation! Give us an explanation!
Give us an explanation!!!
Abolish the elite education system!!!
I amm here now where people are protesting against the Shinhwa Group and they request to have Shinhwa elitist educational system.
Now, let's hear from one of the protesters.
Hello, what brought you out here today??
My friend was also heavily bullied and he dropped out of school...
That sort of thing can happen because of the unbearable stress of the entrance exams, but at a place like this they shouldn't have to suffer those kinds of hardships.
JanDi, do you know what your nickname is?
Common hero, Wonder Girl, you are our generation's true Wonder Woman.
Geum JanDi Laundry, fighting!
By the way, the Flower 4 . . .
Fly 4 makes more sense, four dung flies.
I wish I could see them up close in person. Flower 4?
What flower 4?
Miss Jandi, please look over here!
Miss, please say something.
Excuse me!
Look here! Smile!
Is that school for gifted people?
It's neither a science school nor a foreign language school.
It's literally a school for the rich.
Doesn't Korea pursue a fair society?
That bourgeoisie school is . . .
I'm sorry, Ma'am.
The group PR department and related companies are trying their best to extinguish the public opinion.
Extinguish?
Do you think this is being extinguished?
How do you let the reporters dare?! Dare to mention JoonPyo's name?
I'm deeply ashamed.
Do you know why public opinion is something to be wary of?
Because it is ignorant.
Once it goes berserk, it's unmanageable.
Reason or common sense doesn't work any more.
The one who set the fire should extinguish it.
Madam Chairman, the prime minister is on the line.
Yes, sir.
Yes, It's getting interesting.
I was never cut out for hiding from the paparazzi!
What a tough delivery!
Shoot!
I'm really sick and tired of this ShinHwa school or F 4 something.
I'm ho . . .
She's here!
JanDi!
Say hello to him.
He came from the ShinHwa Chairman's office.
So I finally meet the famous wonder girl. Nice to meet you.
I didn't push him.
Really, I didn't.
F4 or something, they did it.
That's not it.
JanDi, my daughter, calm down and just listen.
Starting tomorrow, you will attend ShinHwa High .
You're in!
What the heck are you . . .
To tell the truth . . .
The Chairman has come to admire you, and she decided to accept you as a special scholarship student!
SHE DEClDED TO ACCEPT YOU!
Scholarship student?
Why me?
We would like you, Geum JanDi . . .
Noona, you know how you used to swim back in middle school?
She wants you to swim again!
SWlM AGAlN!
I don't want to!
What?
And why not?
Noona, are you crazy?
I like the way things are now.
I wouldn't fit into the school and I don't want to go to that school either.
You should probably go.
JanDi, why don't you think about it a litt-
There's no need to think about anything.
She will be there tomorrow.
Shut up!
JanDi: Why not?
Mom: Shut up!
Then, I'll see you at school tomorrow.
Yes, even if I have to drag her by the neck, I will make sure she's at school tomorrow. Okay then.
Mr. Secretary, you are aware of the phrase "Nak Jang Bool Ip."?
"What's done cannot be undone.", right?
MOM!
Be quiet and just take a look at this!
ShinHwa High!
ShinHwa High!
ShinHwa High!
Sister,
I really didn't think this day would come in my lifetime.
For the first time in my life, I am proud to be your brother.
Dad! Wooooohhh!
How can the words, "I'm not going" even come out of your mouth? Do you even know how much the tuition is?
No.
I still don't want to.
I still don't want to go. Mom, I really don't want to. Oh my!
Others study hard, have the money, and they still aren't able to get in . Why wouldn't you want to go?
Wasn't it you who's always saying those people only know how to brag about their wealth?
It, it, it was jealousy.
The truth is, it's like winning the lottery.
Who wouldn't be happy?
I don't care.
I have a bad feeling about this.
Just to let you know, regardless of what you say, I'm not going. But, you like to swim.
You said you wanted to go to a school with a swimming pool.
Are you trying to get me to go to that school by saying they have a swimming pool?
I"m not going.
I don't want to. I'll never go!
Wait!
Just wait a minute, miss!
I'll go and come back. (A Korean saying when they leave the house etc.)
Geum Jan Di, Fight! Go on
Dry cleaning is here, dryyyy cleaningggg!
JanDi dryyyyyy cleaningggg!
Dry cleaning is hereeee!
JanDi dryyyyyy cleaningggg!
Isn't it pretty?
Yeah, it is.
There were only two made imported from Japan.
I got myself one, guess who bought the other?
Who?
Goo JoonPyo.
That's really cool!
Don't you think my style is a lot better?
Hey, let me borrow it.
Hey, me too, me too!
Just where is it?
Uhhmm, do you know where the swimming pool is?
Oh, that way?
Thank you.
I'm so sorry for interrupting.
You can continue on.
Goodbye!
AH!
It's F4!
AHHHH!
Move it!
Is something wrong?
I will give you to a count of three.
What?
Two . . .
One.
Hey, WooBin, do you have some juice left?
Yeah, you want it?
Hey, are you okay?
What kind of crazy person is that?!
How can they just stand there? oh my god
Watch your mouth.
Who are you guys?
Us?
By the way, sorry for the late greeting.
We are Ginger!
Sunny!
Miranda!
We are the Jin, Sun, Mi (the true, the good and the beautiful) of ShinHwa High School.
What you were saying before, it wasn't regarding the F4 was it transfer student?
F, F what?
So that guy who made a scene is a member of the notorious F4? notorious?
You mean famous.
If you're not careful with what you say, you'll be in big trouble!
I hear your family owns a laundry shop.. It's not a laundromat. It's a dry cleaners.
This is my first time seeing a dry cleaner's daughter.
It's very fascinating.
Look all you want, I won't charge you.
Since this is your first day of school and you're a commoner who knows nothing of the world, I'll let you off this time.
What?
For the things you said about the F4!
What?
Are they that remarkable?
Hey transfer student, you really don't know a thing about the F4 do you?
No, I don't.
Girls, let's go.
Song WooBin, the son of Il Sim Construction, also know as the blue-chip stock of the construction industry.
They are real estate tycoons.
People say half of Jejudo belongs to Il-Sim.
The head family of Il-Sim-Pa, an organization(gang) of 50 years history.
They still have quite a few high-class clubs and saloons. When it comes to cash mobilization, they are valued as King Wang Jjang.
So YiJung is a genius ceramic artist who debuted at Biennale at the age of 16 as the youngest artist. He is one of the young artists to be selected by UNESCO.
There is at least one who made it on his own.
Cast away the prejudice that genius would be poor.
You know the cultural assets independence fighter, So YoonHe, in Korean History textbooks?
He is the owner of WooSong Museum and the grandfather of F4 So YiJung.
WooSong Museum?
Do you mean it's his family's?
How rich are they?
Don't imagine.
You'll hurt yourself.
That's a picture of the old president (of Korea).
Look at this kid sitting next to him.
He is F4's very own Yoon Ji Hoo.
The son and daughter-in-law of Yoon SeokYoung president died in a mysterious traffic accident.
The only survivor was his five year-old grandson.
You mean Yoon JiHoo is the grandson of President Yoon SeokYoung?
You know SooAm Art Center where Jang YoungJoo played?
He owns the SooAm Art Foundation, a soccer team in Europe and a Major League baseball team.
I envy him most in the world.
You know him without my explanation, right?
This man is the F4 leader, Goo JoonPyo, the successor of the great ShinHwa group, whom even 3 year-old Korean kids know.
F4 are those sort of guys?
No way!
Goo JoongPyo, you are Goo JoongMool (sewage)!
F4, you flies!
If you were born with a silver spoon in your mouth, you should be thankful and be nice to people!
It's annoying that someone like you is the successor of ShinHwa group!
You better hope the two of us never come face to face.
The day I have to call you "senior", I will dive from the rooftop!
Ahhhh!
Yoon JiHoo!
How noisy.
It's so loud, I can't even sleep.
I'm so sorry. I thought no one was here.
Is that really true?
Eh? That you will dive?
So, the thing is . . .
So you heard everything?
About what?
I mean . . .
Goo JungMool (sewage)? Or flies?
Oh right, JoonPyo
Huh?
It's "Goo JoonPyo," not "Goo JoongPyo".
Remembering the right name is the least thing to do when you hate someone, right?
Rice balls!
You like them?
What the heck are rice balls?
It looks so pretty and delicious!
What's that smell?
It completely stinks!
Oh, here it is.
Oh my god! Terrible!
Hey, transfer student, why are you eating such low grade food when there's an expensive spread over there?
What?
Then?
Over $50 for one meal is a nuisance in my home.
So, you're planning to keep eating these stinky lunch boxes? Yes I am. God!
Good!
It's F4!
MiSook, come on!
I'm going crazy! Can I . . . try that?
Welcome!
Thank You!
Is she from Germany?
Yeah, she looks really pretty.
I thought she was a doll or something.
Anyway, it's great that you made a friend already. I was worried you might be a loner.
I am a loner.
What?
I'm an outcast.
But I'm thankful that I don't get noticed.
I'll stay a loner until the day I graduate.
Who are you?
What happened to our JanDi?
The one who protected me from that wicked kindergarten owner's son, the one who fought against the gangs in junior high.
So what's wrong?
What can I do?
I'd sooner get into it with my mother before causing trouble and being expelled from school.
You!
Ah!
Do you think, do you think I'm wasting cucumbers?!
Your father wanted to eat cucumber kimchi but I'm investing it in your face. What kind of investment are you doing with cucumbers? Won't this treatment give you beautiful skin?
Even the worst boy in your school is the super A plus when it comes to marriage material. It seems we've hit the jackpot. Don't you think so, honey?
Don't disturb me.
I'm artistically sharpening the edge.
Mom, stop this!
Look at you, look at you!
Don't be so ungrateful!
And why are you ironing that?
Your arms'll hurt because of ironing all day long.
15 years in the dry cleaning business and never once before have I seen such fine clothing.
Ordinary people would be lucky to wear such cloth even on their wedding day. Oh, boy!
Sister, let me borrow it to wear on Sunday.
JanDi, when it comes to clothes like this, you must treat them as kindly as your boss.
Be careful when you sit and stand up.
Take good care of it and avoid any stains.
Understand?
I'm ironing this beautiful thing for my daughter.
There's no way my arms would hurt from that.
No, daddy's totally fine.
Oh my!
That girl!
Honey, you should iron the lining too, right?
Justice Girl Geum Jan Di hasn't died yet. Outcast in this way, outcast in that way, and thrown about anyway!
I will say what's on my mind!
F4, from tomorrow, you're all dead!
It's F4!
JoonPyo senior, I baked this myself for you.
Please accept my heart.
Our JoonPyo only eats cakes made by a top-notch patissier.
Who are you?
You have something to say?
Yeah, I have something to say!
I have a lot to say!
You!
Do you have absolutely no respect for people?
I don't even expect you to have humility as a rich person.
If you didn't want to eat it, then you could have rejected it nicely or . . .
Will it kill you to accept it by thinking of that person's effort?
What are you going to do if she says she'll jump off the roof, you bastard!
Who are you?
You have something to say?
No.
Why are you swimming so hard?
You'll become exhausted and faint.
It's punishment. Punishment?
What did you do that was so bad?
It's the punishment that the Justice Girl inflicts upon the super obsequious.
So, do you feel better?
Yes.
All of the reasons why I'm going to this school are right here.
What are they?
The swimming pool and Oh MinJi.
Senior!
I'm so sorry, JoonPyo senior.
Sorry?
If apologizing solved everything there wouldn't be laws and police officers.
But it was an accident.
I'll buy you the same exact shoes right away!
You, are you richer than me?
Pardon?
Even if you had more money, it would be impossible.
These shoes were made by a craftsman in Firenze, how could you possibly buy me the exact same ones immediately?
I'm really sorry.
I'll do anything I can do to fix it.
Anything?
Yes!
Lick it.
Pardon?
I said to lick it.
Senior.
Didn't you say you'd do anything?
Isn't that enough?
You!
You think she fell because she wanted to?
Apologizing is enough, don't you think?
Who's this nosy person?
I'm guessing it hasn't been long since you returned (to Korea), but . . . you shouldn't try to use the American style here.
Why so informal?
Oh, so you're the famous "Wonder Girl"?
People were saying Wonder Woman and stuff, so I expected at least an "S" line and a "D" cup. How homely!
So sorry to dissappoint you.
Is it comon for you to ignore your status and be so nosy?
Why are you butting into other people's business?
She' is my business.
She's my friend.
I guess in rich people's dictionaries, there are no words like "friend" or "friendship"? Friendship?
Let's see this great friendship you speak about.
Lick it.
What?!
I'll forget all about this if you lick it instead.
Hey!
What's up with you?
Does she have more money than you?
Did you yourself earn all of that money?
What?
Is it common for me to be so nosy?
It's common for me not to overlook rich bastards who think it's okay to act out because they wealthy families to bail them out. Why?!
At our place, it's $2.50, but I calculated it by Kangnam standards, ok?
If the stain still doesn't come out, then bring it by.
[JanDi Cleaners, 300-5648]
What the hell is that piece of crap?!
What's the matter with JoonPyo?
I think he's still shocked from what happened today.
He just keeps throwing darts.
What's with that serious face?
Don't bother me.
Can't you hear the wheels turning in my head?
I'm thinking of the best way to completely crush that little weed.
Why are you even bothering to think about her? Just handle things the way you always do.
Man!
You really are smart!
JanDi Cleaners, you're dead now.
Look, look!
Geum JanDi of second year Class B drew an F4 red card!
What is this, a soccer field?
What are they talking about a red card?
(What?)
Hello.
Hello, Crazy!
I guess your desk isn't here.
How can you study with us when you're a commoner?
Why did you even come to school?
My book.
Hey, move over.
Get out of here!
Annoying! Die!
Go screw!
Lick my froth!
You're dead today.
[Fuck off!
Screw you!]
Who did this?
If you have something to say, then then say it to my face!
Who did it?
JanDi, when it comes to this kind of clothing, you must treat it as kindly as your boss.
Be careful with it at all times.
This great suit is my daughter's.
Why would my arms hurt?
Daddy will be just fine.
Throw more!
Throw more!
Just try and throw more!
Hey, hey, hey. Someone bring some oil.
All we have to do now is to fry her.
What wil she be then? A pan fried pumpkin?
Do more!
Just try and do more!
Isn't it over now?
What do you mean over?
It'll be over when that commoner kneels before me.
So, that's why they say not to bother a sleeping wolf.
Don't you mean a lion?
It seems this time it won't even last a week. 1 week? I say three days.
Yi Jung, you, if I win, then I get that traditional pot from your last show.
For a fool that can't tell a pot from a water bottle, what's the sudden interest?
My baby is a fan of the potter, So YiJung.
Okay. If I win, then I get the number of the Super Girls.
Deal!
Hey guys shut up.
It's almost time for her to show up.
Alright.
5, 4, 3, 2, 1. Jjang!
Ah, that's right.
Yep, I was a bit hasty. One more time.
5, 4, 3, 2, 1 . . .
What's wrong with you guys?
Did you do it right?
Then, why isn't she here?
Where the hell did that chick go?
Surrender?
You wish!
I say JanDi, and you think it's grass for you to walk all over?
You picked on the wrong person!
Have you guys ever eaten dough soup that has been cooked with tears?
Have you ever seen a free pass to the public bath house?
Commoners are nothing if not unyielding and persevering!
You should know that!
How many eggs did they just throw away?
Those idiots don't even know how precious flour is.
What's wrong with them?!
So wasteful . . .
How many pancakes could they have made with these?! Seriously!
Oh my!
Who's there?
You're really noisy every time I see you.
Do you know how to make pancakes?
What?
Pancakes.
All you have to do is mix flour, eggs, milk, and sugar and fry it.
Just like Bindeadduk (korean pancake).
That's simple.
Your handkerchief . . .
I don't need it.
I'll return it to you next time.
I won't be here again.
It's no longer quiet, thanks to someone.
I'm sorry, JanDi.
Forgive me for being a coward.
I think it'll be at least $30.
Wow, I know the actual price.
That's not fair.
The express service is a little bit more expensive.
Also, look at the condition of these clothes.
I've already given you quite the discount only because it's a school uniform.
Come on, really.
I'm a junior of the dry cleaning business.
If you don't like the price, forget it.
Next door is JanDi Dry Cleaner.
Go there.
Cmon, Mister.
Alright . . . $25!
Bon apetit !
Yo, yo, yo!
What's up, man?!
They only accept one group per week here, so . . .
I made reservations a month ago and I'm still waiting, so. . .
How did you do it?
This one is better.
You're right.
It's a beauty.
Enough to make your cuisine even finer.
And just who told you that I was a chef?
Your . . . delicious-looking hands.
Do players know things just by looking at a woman's hand?
You need at least to know she's a chef at Michelin in order to be a player.
Of course. My bro, yo!
Yeah.
Are you doing what I told you to do?
Don't make a mistake and do it correctly.
Let's eat.
Alright.
Cheers!
Hey!!
Mom!
Everyone is dying to lose weight, but, here you are stuffing your face?!
Will you be happy if I die doing such a worthless thing?
Hey!
You need to diet and at least have a killer body so the rich boys will notice you!
Really! We're not rich nor do we have a good family background nor are we smart!
What are you talking about?
Dieting is worthless?!
Give me the rice container!
No, I can't.
Right now, surviving is more important than dieting to me.
Hey!
In this day and age, even swimmers must be skinny to become stars!
Haven't you seen Kim YuNa?
You're a young girl, how can you not know the trends?
Give me the rice container!
(Mom!
I said, I don't want to!)
Give it to me!
Hey, you!
Mom, Kim YuNa is a figure skater.
Kim Yuna is a figure skater, not a swimmer!
Stop!
You!
Hey!
Give up the rice container!
Hey!
JanDi?
JanDi?
The rice container . . .
JanDi?
Has my stomach gotten bigger?
A little bit.
I'm sorry. I haven't been able to take care of you.
I'm only putting up with this because of the swimming pool.
If I had attended this kind of school from the get-go, there's no doubt I would have been in the Olympics.
No doubt at all.
What the?
What is this?
Goo Joon Pyo!
Hey!
What's going on?
You keep on smiling to yourself.
She's probably really pissed right about now.
Who?
Perhaps, the laundry girl? Still?
Wait a minute, how long has it been?
It's been over a week.
Okay, hand them over, the girls' phone numbers.
She's really something.
Wait, isn't she the first girl to really face off with the F4?
What are you saying?
It's only because I'm going easy on her.
But, how come JiHoo's not here again?
He's probably sleeping somewhere.
Let go!
Be quiet! Let go of me!

Since people will find your recommendations right when they'll looking for them, you can +1 things you might not send an email or post an update about.
And the next time you're searching, you might see +1s from your friends and contacts, both on Google search and search ads.
So picking the right coffee maker, news article or chocolate chip cookie recipe could get a little easier.
And soon you'll be able to +1 more than just search results.
You'll also find the +1 button on sites across the web, making it easy to +1 pages after you've visited them.
The web's a big place.
Sometimes it helps to have a tour guide.
So if you think something's cool, +1!
